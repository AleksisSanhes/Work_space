Об этом сообщаетИнтерфакс. Поводом для встречи стал резкий рост биржевых цен на бензин и локальный дефицит его в рознице, возникший уже в нескольких регионах России, в том числе вКрымуи Приморском крае. Как и перед прошлым совещанием по тому же вопросу, прошедшем 14 августа, стоимость бензина на Петербургской бирже в последние две торговые сессии резкоснизилась. Тем не менее для Аи-95 она остается выше предыдущего исторического максимума, который был достигнут во время топливного кризиса в сентябре 2023 года, а в прошлый раз непродолжительное падение цен сменилось новым ростом. Основной причиной проблем с бензином, какуказалглава КрымаСергей Аксенов, стало снижение производства на нефтеперерабатывающих заводах (НПЗ). По оценкам экспертов, объем выпуска с начала годасократилсяна 17 процентов. На такую динамику повлияло увеличение срока плановых ремонтов, что глава МинэнергоСергей Цивилевобъяснилсанкциями и сложностью с поставками комплектующих, а также возобновлениеатакбеспилотников, из-за которых ряд предприятий остановили переработку ради срочных ремонтов.", "relevance_reason": "Найдено 2 ключевых слов", "id": "ceb9589442c70f33"}, "channel_id": "-1002996332660"}, "f819850573ef8668": {"message_id": 234, "news_data": {"title": "Власти США предписали остановить строительство ветропарка Orsted стоимостью $4 млрд", "url": "https://www.interfax.ru/business/1043860", "date": "2025-08-25 10:07", "source": "Interfax", "preview": "Власти США предписали остановить строительство ветропарка Orsted стоимостью $4 млрд Американские власти предписали остановить строительство готового на 80% офшорного ветропарка Revolution Wind датской Orsted A/S, сообщил этот оператор ветроэлектростанций.\"Orsted изучает все варианты скорого разрешен...", "full_text": "Ìîñêâà. 25 àâãóñòà.

Он является актуализациейпрогноза, опубликованного в начале года — с учетом данных о вводе мощностей за первые шесть месяцев. В первой половине 2025 года в Соединенных Штатах были введены в эксплуатацию крупномасштабные солнечные электростанции (СЭС) общей мощностью 12 гигаватт (ГВт), и энергетики планируют добавить еще 21 ГВт во второй половине года. В общей сумме это 33 ГВт, что даже несколько превышает февральский прогноз EIA. Особо подчеркнём, что здесь не включены объекты распределенной солнечной генерации, а это еще несколько гигаватт. Если все планы будут реализованы,на солнечную энергетику придется более половиныиз 64 ГВт мощностей электроэнергетики, которые энергокомпании планируют ввести в эксплуатацию в нынешнем году. 64 ГВт – это рекордный показатель годового ввода мощностей для США. Предыдущий рекорд был установлен в 2002 году, когда энергетики добавили в систему 58 ГВт, из которых 57 ГВт работали на природном газе. Около 27% (3,2 ГВт) от общей мощности солнечных электростанций, введенной в эксплуатацию за первые шесть месяцев 2025 года, приходится на Техас, и энергетики планируют ввести в эксплуатацию еще 9,7 ГВт СЭС в этом штате во второй половине года. В прошлом году Техас обогнал Калифорнию по мощности крупномасштабных СЭС. Второе место по размеру прироста мощностей в первом полугодии заняли системы накопления энергии (аккумуляторные батареи) – 5,9 ГВт или 26% общего прироста мощностей электроэнергии. Около половины этого объема пришлось на Аризону и Калифорнию. Энергетики в Техасе планируют ввести в эксплуатацию 7 ГВт накопителей в 2025 году, причем большая часть этой мощности будет введена во второй половине года. В целом по США регулятор ожидает добавления 18,3 ГВт систем накопления энергии за год, что практически соответствует прогнозу, данному в начале года. Если запланированное увеличение мощностей солнечных фотоэлектрических станций и накопителей состоится, обе технологии поставят рекорд по годовым объемам ввода новых объектов. Прирост мощностей ветроэнергетики ожидается на уровне 7,8 ГВт. Также в энергосистему планируется добавить 4,7 ГВт газовых электростанций. Таким образом, на генерацию на основе ископаемого топлива придется лишь 7,3% мощности, добавленной в США в 2025 году. При этом следует учитывать, что в текущем году планируется вывести из эксплуатации газовые ТЭС мощностью 1,6 ГВт, а также угольные мощностью 6,2 ГВт. То есть в стране отмечается сокращение генерирующих мощностей, работающих на основе ископаемого топлива, что свидетельствует о продолжении и усилении процессов декарбонизации энергетики США. Энергетическая политика (и, в большей степени, риторика) Дональда Трампа, направленная против ВИЭ, пока никак не отражается в энергетической статистике. Каких-либо изменений в направлениях развития электроэнергетики и не могло произойти за один год, поскольку инвестиционный цикл в отрасли много длиннее. Прекращение предоставления налоговых вычетов (tax credits) для проектов ВИЭ ожидается с 2028 года. Это ухудшит экономику новых проектов, хотя, принимая во внимание завышенные затраты (в США капитальные затраты на строительство СЭСв два раза выше, чем в Индии или Китае), разработчикам проектов есть куда ужиматься. Возможный запрет на строительство СЭС и ВЭС на сельхозземлях вряд ли сильно повлияет на отрасль, тем более федеральное правительство не имеет прямого контроля за реализацией энергетических проектов в частных владениях. Наконец, альтернатив «альтернативной», как она когда-то называлась, энергетике не так уж и много. Несмотря навторую попыткуТрампа спасти уголь, вряд ли найдется много инвесторов, готовых сегодня вкладываться в угольную генерацию. К слову, в 2024 годуветровые и солнечные электростанции впервые обошли(совместно) угольную генерацию по выработке (17,2% против 14,9%). В июле EIA сообщало, что СШАпланируютзакрыть угольные электростанции общей мощностью 27 ГВт до конца 2028. Что касается «атомного ренессанса», о котором много говорят, и не только говорят, но и принимают разныедокументы, то это дело очень небыстрое.

В публикации показано, что выбросы в Китае сократились на 1% в годовом исчислении в первом полугодии 2025 года. При этом выбросы CO2 в энергетическом секторе страны, который является основным эмитентом выбросов,сократились более чем на 3%в первой половине года, поскольку рост только солнечной генерации «перекрыл» весь прирост потребления электроэнергии, который составил 3,7%. Использование угля в электроэнергетике Китая сократилось на 3,4% по сравнению с аналогичным периодом годом ранее, тогда как использование газа увеличилось на 6%, что привело к снижению выбросов в секторе в целомна 3,2%. Анализ Carbon Brief показывает, чторекордное увеличениемощностей солнечной энергетики позволит Китаю сократить выбросы CO2 за 2025 год в целом. Единственным крупным сектором, где наблюдался рост выбросов в первой половине года, стала химическая промышленность, а вот выбросы в секторе производства строительных материалов сократились на 3%. Однако даже если выбросы Китая сократятся в 2025 году, ему, скорее всего, не удастся достичь ряда важных климатических целей, включая цели по снижению интенсивности выбросов углерода (выбросов на единицу ВВП), контроль за ростом потребления угля и новыми мощностями угольных электростанций, а также увеличение доли стали, производимой в электродуговых печах, в общем объеме производства стали. Доля электродуговой стали в общем объеме производства снизилась с 10,2% в 2024 году до 9,8% в первой половине 2025 года, несмотря на целевой показатель правительства в 15% на этот год. Ожидается, что в текущем году мощности угольных электростанций резко возрастут, несмотря на сокращение спроса на электроэнергию, вырабатываемую за счёт угля. Государственная электросетевая компания прогнозирует прирост тепловой мощности в 127 ГВт. В том числе мощности угольных ТЭС могут вырасти на 80-100 ГВт. Напомню Китай официально стремитсядостичь пика выбросов углекислого газа до 2030 года иуглеродной нейтральности до 2060 года. В апреле исследовательская компания BloombergNEFпредположила, что пик энергетических выбросов углерода в мире был пройден в 2024 году.

Suzlon взяла на себя обязательство к 2030 годуполностью перейти на возобновляемые источники энергии на всех своих 15 производственных предприятиях в Индии. Этот шаг является частью плана декарбонизации Suzlon, направленного на достижение углеродной нейтральности по категориям охвата выбросов 1 и 2 к 2035 году и по категориям 1, 2 и 3 к 2040 г. Категория 1 охватывает прямые выбросы в процессе производства, категория 2 – косвенные выбросы от закупленной электроэнергии, а категория 3 охватывает всю цепочку производственной деятельности – от выбросов поставщиков до окончания жизненного цикла продукции. В прошлом году компания достигла «92,87% углеродной нейтральности» на уровне одного завода, при этом её предприятие по производству роторов и лопастей в Дхуле уже полностью работает на возобновляемых источниках энергии. По итогам 2024-2025 финансового года компания зафиксировала снижение энергоемкости на 17,19% по сравнению с 2023–2024 финансовым годом, а также сокращение интенсивности выбросов по категориям 1 и 2 на 88,51%. Потребление возобновляемой энергии также выросло на 80,7%, что отражает прогресс Suzlon в достижении своих целей в области устойчивого развития. Дж. П. Чаласани, генеральный директор Suzlon Group, заявил: «Присоединение к RE100 — это убедительное подтверждение нашей веры в то, что истинное лидерство в области возобновляемой энергетики начинается дома — в том, как мы управляем собственным производством. Мы не просто поставляем чистую энергию по всему миру; мы гарантируем, что каждый мегаватт нашей продукции подкреплен производственным процессом, полностью основанным на возобновляемых источниках энергии. Это обязательство — одновременно ответственность перед планетой и обещание будущим поколениям: подавать пример, внедрять инновации без компромиссов и внедрять принципы устойчивого развития в ДНК всего, что мы делаем». Вопрос углеродного следа возобновляемых источников энергии основательно исследован. Он во много раз ниже, чем у генерации электроэнергии на основе ископаемого топлива, а использование возобновляемой электроэнергии в процессе производства оборудования позволяет снизить его ещё больше. Это также важно при экспорте продукции. Неудивительно, что многие производители оборудования для ветровых и солнечных электростанций всё в большей мере используют ВИЭ в своей производственной деятельности. Многие из них также являются участниками инициативы RE100. В 2024 году Suzlonсообщилао заключении контракта с компанией Jindal Renewables на поставку ветрогенераторов общей мощностью 400 МВт, которые будет задействованы для декарбонизации производства стали в Индии.

Установка способна производить 72 тонны зеленого водорода в год для последующего подмешивания в газораспределительную сеть Torrent Gas в Горахпуре. При этом доля H2 в сети не будет превышать 2%. Проект «снижает выбросы и создает платформу для декарбонизации на транспорте и в промышленности», — говорится в сообщении компании в социальной сети LinkedIn. Это, насколько мы знаем, третий подобный проект в Индии. В январе 2023 года государственная энергетическая компания NTPC начала добавлять зеленый H2 в трубопроводную газовую сеть в жилом комплексе, принадлежащем NTPC, недалеко от города Сурат, штат Гуджарат. В октябре прошлого года индийская газовая компания Adani Total Gas — совместное предприятие индийского конгломерата Адани и французского нефтегазового концерна TotalEnergies —начала подмешиватьзеленый водород в газораспределительную сеть в штате Гуджарат на Западе Индии. Затея подмешивать водород в газовые сети является весьма спорной. В частности, она была подвергнутарезкой критикенемецким Институтом экономики энергетики и технологий энергетических систем (Fraunhofer IEE) как «расточительное» использование возобновляемых источников энергии, а британский аналитический центр E3G охарактеризовал практику как «гринвошинг», поскольку она обеспечивает лишь небольшое сокращение выбросов CO2 и продлевает зависимость от ископаемого газа.

Let’s take a look at the market as a whole in the 2nd quarter as well as trends with individual companies. Overall, US auto sales were up 3% in Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2024, and also up 3% in Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2023. That’s much different from the first two post-COVID years of 2021 (down 10%) and 2022 (up 17%). Naturally, markets were quite warped for a while, especially with supply chain challenges in the auto industry related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as well as the COVID crisis. The leading auto brands in the country were Ford and Toyota in Q2 2025, followed by Chevrolet, Honda, and Hyundai. As another example of Tesla’s fall, the all-electric US brand dropped from9th in Q2 2024to 11th in Q2 2025. Not great. Can the EV company get back into the top 10? We’ll see…. Other all-electric brands Rivian and Lucid were ranked 31st and 33rd, respectively. Rivian was down from 29th a year before, while Lucid repeated its ranking in 33rd place. Yes, I know — is it worth talking about their rankings at this point? Well, you’ve got to start somewhere. The bad news here for EV brands is that Tesla sales dropped by 13%, or 20,729 units, year over year in Q2, and Rivian sales dropped by 23%, or 3,129 units, in the same time. On the positive side, Lucid sales were up 10%, or by 241 units. Comparing to Q2 2023, we can again see that the country’s biggest auto brands (Ford, Toyota, Chevrolet, Honda, and Hyundai) saw solid growth in Q2. On a percentage basis, Fiat surged the most, but Fiat barely sells any cars in the US. (That said, they’re all electrics.) Lucid was second for percentage growth, but, again, it hardly sells any vehicles. Again, we see big declines from Tesla (-18%, or -31,727 units) and Rivian (-16%, or -1,979 units). Just as a note, though, electric vehicle sales were up strongly overall — a point we’ll come back to in a separate article. Going back to Q2 2022, we finally see growth from Rivian (+139%, or +6,194 units) and Tesla (+10%, or +13,488 units) again. And, to wrap up this section, we can see that Tesla sales grew 88% from Q2 2021 to Q2 2025, more than any auto brand other than Lexus. On a volume basis, only Ford grew more. So, it’s still a stunning improvement across four years for the country’s leading EV seller. More broadly, it’s clearly been a good amount of growth for Ford and Lexus. The last chart I’ll post here is one looking at all of these brands across all of these years. Below is both a static chart and an interactive chart (both best viewed on a real computer, not a phone). It’s a giant chart, and you can spend a lot of time looking through the trends across the brands from Q2 2021 to Q2 2025. Enjoy! Zach is tryin' to help society help itself one word at a time.

Dr. James Hansen, the noted NASA scientist who first testified in front of the US Congress about the connection between carbon dioxide and a warming, has been a vocal advocate for the group’s work. In fact, his granddaughter was one of the young plaintiffs in the groundbreaking case ofJuliana Vs. US, which sought to obtain a ruling that the federal government has a duty to protect the lives and health of its citizens, a position that is bitterly opposed by the fossil fuel industry. Our Children’s Trust did achieve amilestone victory in Montanarecently. Section 1 of Article IX of the Montana constitution says specifically: The Montana Supreme Court has now ruled that section means precisely what it says and has invalidated laws passed by the state’s legislature that were designed to limit the application of Article IX. Now Our Children’s Trust has teamed up with an environmental law firm in Wisconsin called Midwest Environmental Advocates to represent a group of 15 young Wisconsin residents in a legal action that seeks to invalidate two state statutes. They claim those statures unfairly benefit fossil fuel powered thermal electricity generation and limit the amount of renewable energy available within the state. In addition, the lawsuit alleges the continued use of fossil fuels in energy generation is harming their young plaintiffs’ basic constitutional rights and creating an unstable future for them. The case was filed on August 22 against the Public Service Commission and the state legislature. “The science around how climate change is going to affect Wisconsin is clear. It’s affecting us now. It’s only going to get worse, and it will get worse if Wisconsin keeps pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,” Tony Wilkin-Gibart, the executive director of MEA and one of the lawyers for the case, told the press. “We believe that (their constitutional rights are) being violated by the state continuing to pump greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere and drive the climate crisis in ways that are harming our clients and profoundly disrupting their ways of life and jeopardizing the stability of their future,” Wilkin Gibart said, according to a report byWisconsin Public Radio. “Our clients are asking the court to uphold their right to a livable future,” he said. “This case is about whether they will inherit a future shaped by clean energy and a stable climate — or one burdened by fossil fuel pollution, extreme weather events, and growing threats to their health and safety.” Specifically, one Wisconsin law today prevents the state’s public service commission from considering toxic and planet-heating air pollution when considering permits for new fossil fuel power plants, while another bars the PSC from requiring utilities to increase the amount of electricity they obtain from carbon-free sources. “These laws set up a system where the public service commission continues to approve fossil fuel power plants and cannot bring online more renewable energy,” Nate Bellinger, supervising staff attorney at Our Children’s Trust, toldThe Guardian. Wisconsin has pledged to transition to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050, but those laws are diametrically opposed to implementing that policy initiative. “The state legislature and the executive branch have both set goals and mandates to decarbonize the electricity sector,” said Bellinger. “These laws are getting in the way of that.” He claimed the laws in Wisconsin are ripe for a challenge. “The case is really a challenge to the electricity sector in Wisconsin, which is still predominantly powered by fossil fuels, and there’s a lot of opportunity there to transition that to renewables,” he said. The lawsuit criticizes the PSC for not requiring utilities to invest more than 10% in renewable energy and points to policies in Wisconsin that give fossil fuels like coal and natural gas an edge when it comes to choosing and developing new power plants. Fossil fuels provide about 75 percent of Wisconsin’s electricity today. “The trends that we’re seeing in Wisconsin are so profound, and the impacts of climate change are affecting Wisconsinites right now,” Wilkin-Gibart said. “We’re on track for a record number of smoke-filled days this summer. This entire summer has been marked by thoughts and anxiety about whether young people, and frankly any Wisconsinites, can go out and exercise and spend time with family.” The complaint claims the young plaintiffs are exposed to a greater incidence of health risks, including asthma and respiratory illnesses made worse by increases in average temperatures and air pollution, flooding of their homes and communities, and mental health trauma tied to ecological loss and extreme weather events. Perhaps the latest study that shows climate-related pollution contributes to over90,000 premature deathsin the US each year will bolster their case. “We’re in a situation here in the state where we have state laws that tell our Public Service Commission to completely ignore these climate impacts, to completely ignore what our clients are experiencing, and to completely ignore the fate of these young people and future generations,” Wilkin-Gibart said. Ted Schultz-Becker is one of the young plaintiffs. He said in a press release reported by theMilwaukee Journal Sentinelthat the lawsuit represents a chance to have the voices of Wisconsin youth heard. “These laws force my government to ignore science and pollution. That’s wrong and unconstitutional. Young people have power, even when we can’t vote. Our voices matter, and we trust our Constitution and courts to protect us.” The attorneys are asking a judge to strike down state laws that limit consideration of climate effects and cap renewable energy requirements when regulators determine whether to approve or deny new projects. They want a judge to rule the laws violate their clients’ constitutional rights and find that the Public Service Commission and Legislature have a duty to protect the health and welfare of the young plaintiffs. The lawsuit is likely to face opposition from the Republican-controlled Legislature and its top leaders. Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos is on record as saying that climate change “probably” is real. Wisconsin Democrats have repeatedly introduced a package of bills to combat climate change andshift to clean energy, but Vos has said such efforts are only “pandering to the very liberal base.” Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu has said such legislation would only “triple down on the ‘Green New Deal’ disaster.” Republican lawmakers have also promoted legislation that would prevent state and local governments from enacting mandates that favor electric vehicles or restrict the use of propane or methane stoves, claiming they want to protect consumer choices. Governor Tony Evers vetoed those bills because he said they would limit the state’s ability to combat climate change. If the latest lawsuit is successful, it will spark a torrent of backlash from Republicans in Wisconsin. In the event they follow the example set by so-called leaders at the national level, they may simply choose to ignore any court decision. This case has national implications and we will keep our readers informed as it moves forward.

It has a large presence in the US, but also works withpartners in Europeas well as Singapore, Thailand, and India. In Europe, the company manages some of the continent’s largest depot charging operations, including V2G pilots in Germany and the Netherlands. Gregor Hintler, CEO of The Mobility House North America, toldElectriverecently the business case for charging systems comes with both opportunity and risk. While federal programs such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the EPA’s Clean School Bus Program, created during the Biden administration, helped boost the deployment of large-scale charging installations, these funds are now in jeopardy because the current administration deems them to be examples of fraud and waste. Hintler said most federally funded programs for EV infrastructure are being phased out, which will have significant consequences for public sector projects in the years to come. A small light in the darkness is the restoration of funds for the NEVI public charging program that was announced recently, although grudgingly. In Montgomery County in Maryland, The Mobility House is taking part in a signature microgrid project that Hintler says demonstrates how infrastructure can be future-proofed against policy reversals. The Brookville Smart Energy Bus Depot integrates solar panels, battery storage, gas generation, and ChargePilot smart charging software from The Mobility House. That installation combines two megawatts of solar capacity, a 4 megawatt-hour stationary storage system, and 56 charge points — 7 Heliox stations, two pantograph chargers, and four Proterra chargers. The entire operation is managed by the company’s ChargePilot platform that makes it possible for fleet operations to continue even during grid outages. Hintler views such projects as more than technical milestones. For him, microgrids are a political and economic statement. “This project represents resilience, not just operationally, but politically. It was designed to work independently of the grid, and that’s symbolic of where we see the market heading.” ChargePilot ensures dynamic load management, distributing available power based on each vehicle’s state of charge and departure schedule. If the depot switches to island mode with limited capacity, the software automatically prioritizes essential charging to maintain fleet operations The Mobility House is participating in multiple projects across North America. Its ChargePilot software is managing depot charging for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York City and its expanding fleet of electric buses. In California, the company supports theTurlock Unified School Districtnear San Jose, which operates electric buses with advanced load management to reduce grid impact. Hintler notes that these deployments demonstrate ChargePilot’s flexibility across different fleet types and grid contexts, fromschool districtsto major urban bus networks and airport shuttles. Although support for vehicle electrification is rapidly shrinking at the federal level in the US, progressive states like California, New York, and Massachusetts remain committed to their climate targets. It’s more of an uphill climb than it used to be, as federal initiatives such as the Advanced Clean Trucks and Advanced Clean Fleets initiatives are targeted for elimination. Hintler warns that repealing these regulations would eliminate fleet transition mandates, stalling market growth in affected states. “Most of the federally funded programs for EV infrastructure are being phased out. That’s not a projection—it’s a reality,” he says. However, sectors such as commercial logistics, waste management, and private shuttles remain economically viable for electrification without subsidies. That’s why The Mobility House is putting more emphasis on these resilient markets alongside public transit and school bus projects. Hintler notes that the economics of electrification in heavy-duty fleets are improving rapidly due to reduced battery costs, improved vehicle range, and operational savings on fuel and maintenance. In other words, Adam Smith’s unseen hand still trumps ideology and ignorance. But there is a subtext here as well. If Hintler is correct, any business model that is dependent on public financial or policy support has a potential flaw that could come back to bite it. Tesla is about to learn this lesson as payments for exhaust emission credits are reduced. The federal government no longer requires automakers to meet emissions standards or buy credits from others. That system has fed billions of dollars into the coffers at Tesla. The loss of that revenue will be significant, a reality that Tesla shareholders seem oblivious to. Despite public sector uncertainty, interest in expandingEV charging infrastructureby automakers and private fleet investment remains strong. Nearly $200 billion has been committed to EV and battery production domestically, with new factories coming online nationwide. Hintler believes that manufacturers often understate their progress publicly to avoid political backlash but remain fully committed to electrification strategies. “But behind the scenes, no one’s pulling back,” he says. This bifurcation between a cautious public sector and an assertive private sector demands strategic flexibility, Hintler believes. The Mobility House is making it a priority to work with fleet operators who can extract operational returns independent of grants. While school bus projects remain politically attractive, they are vulnerable to funding cuts. Waste collection, logistics, and private shuttle fleets are continuing their electrification plans regardless of changes in policy at the federal level. Technology must compensate for the lack of regulatory incentives and requirements, Hintler believes. Optimization using software tools becomes vital when electrification must stand on its own merits. Because of the flexibility of the ChargePilot platform — whether in grid-connected or microgrid-integrated mode — it makes certain that electric vehicles are charged efficiently regardless of policy shocks or grid constraints. For Hintler, the global reach of the ChargePilot platform reinforces a simple reality. Decarbonization is moving forward even if new bumps in the road have been added. The economics, manufacturing commitments, and international direction remain too strong to reverse. The challenge now is adaptation — designing solutions that work despite policy fragility. What is needed is strategic realism, he believes. The path forward is about resilience and integrating technological flexibility with market pragmatism. Projects such as Montgomery County’s microgrid show that The Mobility House is already building this future, one depot at a time. There is a larger lesson here, which is that the relationship between utility companies and their customers — whether residential or commercial — is changing. Because of the rise of renewables, battery storage, and software platforms, the day when those customers no longer need utility companies is on the horizon. It won’t happen this year or even this decade, but it will happen. The utility industry is founded on the bedrock idea that utilities have a social license to operate as monopolies, but if people and business can generate their own electrons, that policy support may become irrelevant. The only constant in life is change. Those who do not recognize the power of that maxim and who depend on government policies for their existence are always vulnerable to changes in those policies. It takes vision to be successful, something that The Mobility House has shown it has plenty of.

The clown car that used to be known as the US government has brought its oversized shoes down upon the US offshore wind industry once again. This time the victim is the Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island, brought to a screeching halt by order of the Interior Department even though it is already 80% complete. Connecticut is also impacted because it is a partner in the project. And, once again, a proposed multistate gas pipeline is lurking in the background. The Revolution stop-work ordertakes note of unspecified security concerns, which sounds rather mysterious if not downright sketchy. For some insights into the reasons for taking such an extreme measure, let’s take a quick look at the stop-work order that frozethe Empire Wind projectin New York State earlier this year. Empire is a project of the Norwegian diversified energy firm Equinor, and work was already well underway when the Interior Department brought the hammer down in April. The freeze was a temporary one. According to multiple reports, New York State Governor Kathy Hochul struck a bargain with the White House, and the proposedConstitution gas pipelinewas among the bargaining chips. Equinor’s status as a leading US oil and gas producer may have also factored into the de-freeze. As of this writing, work on Empire Wind is proceeding apace. As for the Constitution pipeline, it was first proposed by the firm Williams in 2014 with the aim of bringing gas from Pennsylvania into New York State, to connect with offtakers in New England. State environmental officials redlighted the project in 2016, but Williams hung in there for a few more years before officially dropping the proposal in 2020. Now, suddenly, here it comes again, magically brought back to life. Williams has other projects in the works throughout the US, and thebenefits of the new pipelineto consumers in New England are unclear. However, for reasons best known only to Williams, the Constitution pipeline is reportedly on the fast track to approval. The Revolution Wind stop-work order could be a temporary one as well. Though, that remains to be seen. Its developer, the Danish firm Ørsted, does not have US oil and gas investments to bargain with. However, there is a pipeline involved, and that’s where the Trump administration could apply some pressure on state officials in Rhode Island and Connecticut. The pipeline in question is Project Maple. It comes under the umbrella of the Canadian firm Enbridge. As described in a letter of opposition signed by dozens of environmental groups and community organizations in the region,Project Maple is a rebrandof the former Access Northeast project, in which Enbridge proposed another in a series of expansions on its existing, 1,100-mile Algonquin Gas Transmission Pipeline from Pennsylvania to points east. Enbridge mothballed Access Northeast back in 2017, but the project found its legs again in the form of Project Maple, shortly after the results rolled in from the 2024 Presidential election cycle. “Enbridge wants to expand its 1,100-mile-long natural gas pipeline system, the Algonquin Gas Transmission Pipeline,” the Conservation Law Foundation noted in an update on April 18. “This system runs from New Jersey through New York and into Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts,” CLF elaborated.“While the details are vague because this proposal is still in its early stages, we do know that Enbridge wants to replace existing pipelines, add new secondary pipelines, and expand compressor stations throughout the system’s route.” If you have reason to believe that Project Maple is the end game of the Revolution Wind stop-work order, drop a note in the comment thread. Before you do, though, consider that Enbridge is a Canadian company. Relations between the Trump administration and Canadian companies have become rather frayed of late, to put it mildly. Be that as it may, Pennsylvania is the nation’s second-largestproducer of natural gas, and US-based gas producers that operate in Pennsylvania have an interest in seeing Project Maple spread its branches. Besides, Enbridge is a pipeline owner and operator, not a construction firm. When Enbridge sets pipeline work in motion, the hands-on tasks are handled by the pipeline construction people, and that’s where things get interesting. Take a look over at Michigan, for example, where Enbridge seeks to replace its Line 5 oil and gas pipeline. The contractor on the project is the firmBarnard Construction, which is known for its billion-dollar work on Trump’s border wall.The Guardian is among the news organizations to pick up the Line 5 thread earlier this year. “Donald Trump’s administration is being accused by activists of a quid pro quo as it attempts to fast-tracka controversial fossil fuel pipelineproposal in Michigan that would in part be built by a donor with deep financial ties to the president,”The Guardiannoted in March, adding that “the contractor is Tim Barnard, who, along with his wife, gave $1m to Trump’s campaign last year.” Of course, this doesn’t mean that similar monkey business is afoot at Project Maple. It simply means that Enbridge does not appear to have suffered any political fallout from the hostilities sparked by the Trump administration’s tariff wars, at least for the time being. As for the US offshore wind industry, practically every state on the Eastern seaboard from Maine down to North Carolina has been banking on offshore wind to meet climate goals, stabilize fuel costs, and reduce their dependence on oil and gas shipped in from points west. Now the whole industry is in jeopardy as the Trump administrationputs the squeeze on the entire federal offshore lease programat one end, while monkey-wrenching Revolution Wind and other projects that have already started construction. States in “real America” are feeling the pain as well. Offshore wind advocates like to point out that offshore wind farms are vast, complicated infrastructure projects that createthousands of manufacturing jobsall over the US as well as portside jobs in their home states. The deep red state of Louisiana, for example, lent its offshore oil and gas expertise to construct the nation’s very first offshorewind farmin the US almost 10 years ago, and Louisiana businesses continued to make majorcontributions to the industryon through this year. Whelp, kiss that goodbye. It was only last year that Ørsted and the Louisiana shipbuilder Edison Chouest Offshore celebrated the launch of the first purpose-built offshore windconstruction vesselmade in the USA, the ECO Edison. That could be the last one Edison ever builds for the US market. Meanwhile, Ørsted hascomplied with the stop-work orderand is examining its options. Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont and Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee — both Democrats — havevowed to savethe project. Perhaps they should take a look over at Virginia, where theCoastal VirginiaOffshore Wind project is chugging merrily along, wrapped securely in the security blanket of support from Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin — for now.

Citing “concerns that have arisen” during a review, the US Department of the Interior (DOI)has informedRevolution Wind, LLCthat it cannot resume any activities until so notified. The announcement threatens already tenuous wind alliances across commercial fishers, the offshore wind industry, environmentalists, clean power advocates, and investors. Revolution Wind, a subsidiary of Ørsted, is complying with the order and is “taking appropriate steps to stop offshore activities, ensuring the safety of workers and the environment.” TheØrsted visionis a world that runs entirely on green energy. In the August 22 Ørsted press release, the companydescribedhow Revolution Wind has 20-year power purchase agreements to deliver 400 MW of electricity to Rhode Island and 304 MW to Connecticut, “enough to power over 350,000 homes across both states to meet their growing energy demand.” The adjacent South Fork Wind, which uses the same turbine technology, “delivered reliable energy to New York at a capacity factor of 53% for the first half of 2025, on par with the state’s baseload power sources.” The project is located about 15 miles south of the Rhode Island coast and 32 miles southeast off the shores of Connecticut. Only a handful of offshore wind projects in the United Statesarestill under construction, including Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind, NY; Vineyard Wind near Martha’s Vineyard, MA; and the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, a Democrat, said the state was “evaluating all legal options to protect Connecticut’s interests.” Arguing that the Trump administration “wants to mothball billions of dollars in investment and cancel one of the best new sources of American-made, renewable energy,” Tong called out the President and his advisors for the harm they will cause to everyday consumers. “Trump and his enablers will own the resulting cost increases for ratepayers.” Tonghas joineda coalition of 19 attorneys general in filing a lawsuit against the Trump Administration over its unlawful attempt to freeze the development of wind energy. “With the significant investments made in this project already and its obvious benefit to our economy and climate,” RI Attorney General Peter F. Neronhaadded, “the Trump Administration’s attempt to halt it can only be characterized as bizarre.” Globally the offshore wind industryis ramping upfull speed ahead. On the other end of the energy spectrum, though, the Trump administration continues to do all it can to enhance the oil, gas, and coal industries. Theyare trying to haltpolicies in place that curb carbon emissions. They have reneged on federal grants, fired workers en masse, and attacked longstanding environmental regulations. They have frozen funds appropriated by Congress for clean energy projects and taken particular aim at wind energy, the country’s largest source of renewable power. They are promoting the dirtiest and most expensive fossil fuels in place of large offshore wind farms. Yet the untold story is about higher consumer utility rates, which are largely a result of higher demand. That demand, in turn, are being driven by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence, oil and gas drilling, space heating, and electrified forms of transportation,explainsRob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a DC-based energy consultancy firm. All of these technologies require extraordinary amounts of power. Offshore windcan reducethe need for peaker plants. In wholesale electricity markets, peak power costs set the price for the whole market. DOI deputy press secretary Aubrie SpadytoldtheDaily Caller(co-founded by Tucker Carlson) that people in the US don’t want or need renewable energy. “Americans deserve energy that is affordable, reliable, and built to last — not experimental and expensive wind projects that are proven failures. In line with President Donald Trump’s Energy Dominance Agenda, Interior is putting an immediate stop to these costly failures to deliver a stronger energy future and lower costs for American families. Like President Trump said, ‘the days of stupidity are over in the USA!’” Ahem. As is their norm, lies are more important for the Trump administration than data or peer-reviewed research. In 2025, many businesses face an insidious threat: the danger that the Trump administration will tell their company’s story faster, louder, or more convincingly than they do. And what’s become clear is the truth doesn’t matter. Executive orders now introduce policy uncertainty. Funding freezes lead to project delays. Investors retreat — as Marianne O’ConnoroutlinesinPR News, “not due to technological failings but because of politically driven narrative shifts.” This abrupt reversal rocked markets and cast doubt on the viability of wind power overall, illustrating how quickly external narratives can destabilize entire sectors. Offshore wind developers never fully grounded their story in rural revitalization, energy independence. or patriotism, O’Connor argues, and these are themes that might have defused political hostility. Another gap seems a deficit of relatable spokespeople, such as utility customers, turbine technicians, coastal business owners, or veterans retrained for green jobs — “who could retake the narrative and humanize the industry.” Instead of hyperbole, the nuances of offshore wind need to be explored. Despite the recent increase in offshore wind deployments, decision-making bodies have been making slow progress in measuring cumulative impacts. Expertsdescribehow: Several offshore wind advocacy groups have spoken out about the Trump halt to the Revolution Wind project. One is Climate Action RI, whichposteda message on social media criticizing the Trump administration’s action. “Revolution Wind is essential not only for our work to mitigate the climate crisis, but Rhode Island’s energy and economic future,” wrote Christian Roselund, clean energy policy analyst and “Yes to Wind” team leader. Liz Burdock, CEO of Oceantic Network,stated, “This dramatic action further erodes investor confidence in the US market across all industries and undermines progress on shared national priorities—shipyard revitalization, steel and port investments, and energy dominance.” Carolyn Fortuna, PhD, is a writer, researcher, and educator with a lifelong dedication to ecojustice.

A “succession crisis” for their most popular model? Having obsessively followed BYD for a while, I thought I could provide some perspective. The Song Plus was BYD’s best-selling vehicle and the best-selling vehicle in China overall in the first half of the year. BYD’s model lines are split into different series: the Dynasty series, with model names based on historical dynasties, and the Ocean series, with model names based on sea animals (or, previously, warships). These different series were typically sold at different dealerships. However, the Song Plus is an outlier, being sold at Ocean dealerships. At the end of July, BYD introduced theSealion 06. This is essentially the successor to the Song Plus, offered as a BEV and a PHEV. It was renamed to better fit the Ocean dealers that sell it. The Sealion 06 is a new car in China (not to be confused with the overseasSealion 6) on a new platform with more technology and better equipment, but with similar pricing. The BEV version is also stronger, with RWD and a frunk. Throughout July, Ocean dealerships were actively reducing Song Plus inventory to make way for the Sealion 06. Sealion 06 sales are still ramping up, and it has been rolling out to different markets within China throughout this month, such asHangzhouon August 7th,Beijingon August 10th, andGuangzhouon August 13th. However, initialreportsout of China already place it as the best-selling vehicle in its class and the second best-selling SUV, even before it was available throughout the country. As expected, BEV versions have been outselling PHEV versions. Combined with remaining sales of the Song Plus, which is essentially the previous generation, it is heading back to the top of the lists. BYD might keep selling the Song Plus alongside the Sealion 06 for a little while, like Ram did with the 1500 Classic, but I expect volume to shift to the new Sealion 06 in China. However, the Song Plus tooling is heading to overseas manufacturing plants, which recently started production or will soon. Uzbekistan started productionlast year, for example. And it is the best-selling NEV in other markets, likeTurkiye(as the Seal U), which also has amanufacturing plantscheduled to come online next year. The Song Plus’s days may be numbered within China, but it still has a future in global markets. In addition, other older models, particularly those based on the 4thGeneration DM-i platform, are seeing production shift overseas. The Song Pro is to be produced inBrazil, where it was thebest-selling NEVin the first half of this year. The Chaser/Destroyer, which used to show up on top selling vehicle lists in China, recently started production inThailand(to be sold under several other names). Overall, BYD has beeninvesting more in overseas manufacturing than at home. This may not be the company’s most advanced technology, especially in countries with technology sharing agreements, but it is a significant step up from competing products in those markets. And it is likely to fuel BYD’s global growth, which has been faster overseas than at home this year. Meanwhile, BYD hasn’t stopped developing PHEVs. The most recent news being a 10% reduction in fuel consumption for the 5thgeneration DM-i platform, created through an AI-enabled system optimization based on real-world usage data that was rolled out via an OTA update to new and existing vehicles. It is first being rolled out to the Qin L and Seal 06, reducing fuel consumption after the battery range runs out to 2.6l/100km (~90 mpg) NEDC. Even though this is an optimistic rating system, these midsized cars are rated as the most fuel-efficient under that system. Similar optimizations are to be rolled out to other vehicles, with more updates possible in the future, especially with new hardware. A 10% improvement from just a software update is pretty impressive when you really start thinking about it (biofuels have a smaller percentage impact, atabout 6%of US transportation fuel). Overall, the improved performance has the potential to stimulate PHEV sales in the short term and thus extend sales life, even if BEVs have the long-term advantage. In ameeting with dealers in China, Wang Chaunfu stated that BYD was in the process of reducing redundant models. We have become accustomed recently to BYD continuing old models while a multitude of new models are introduced. As models change and production shifts, there can be some temporary disruptions, but these changes are necessary to set up for the long term. Looking at August, based on preliminary discussions, I anticipate another transitional month in China, with the Sealion 06 still ramping up and other products shifting. September will be interesting. Overall, BYD’s sales are driven by product. New product is taking over while older product falls back. While factors likeBlack PRcan have some temporary influence, strong product tends to overcome it in the long term. Last year, BYD had stronger PHEV product introductions and sales. This year, BEVs have had stronger product introductions and sales. It is hard to be sure what next year will bring. More effort might go to product for outside markets, with growth shifting accordingly. But with over 120,000 R&D engineers andmore EV intellectual propertythan anyone, I would bet that the long-term “peak” is far down the road. Larry lives in Queens, NY, with his wife and cats.

On one side, housing supply has failed to keep up with demand for decades. Affordability is slipping out of reach for many households, and the workforce that builds homes is aging and stretched thin. On the other side, buildings and construction remain a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Much of the public discussion has focused on operational energy, but a third of the climate problem in this sector is tied up in embodied carbon from materials like cement and steel. Those emissions are locked in before a single family or tenant ever moves into a unit. What is becoming clear is that there is one lever that can address both issues at once. Cross laminated timber, or CLT, combined with modular manufacturing, can industrialize housing while cutting embodied emissions at scale. The diagnosis — as always, I’m leveraging Rumelt’s kernel of good strategy — is straightforward. Canada’s annual housing completions hover around 240,000 to 270,000 units, while population growth points to the need for about 500,000 per year to stabilize affordability. Traditional site built construction is not delivering those numbers, and throwing more labor at the problem is not realistic given the shortages in skilled trades. At the same time, we continue to pour concrete and erect steel, cementing millions of tons of emissions in the process. These materials have a role in infrastructure, but they are overused in mid rise residential construction where other options are available. Housing delivery is slow, labor is scarce, and embodied carbon is ignored. That combination is unsustainable. The guiding policy is to treat housing like advanced manufacturing. Instead of bespoke site work, we should think of apartments and mid rise condos the way we think of cars or appliances. They can be produced in factories, standardized for safety and efficiency, and shipped as panels or modules to be assembled quickly. CLT is the core material that makes this possible. It is strong, light, renewable, and produced from trees that sequester carbon as they grow. Modular construction methods allow for site preparation and factory production to occur in parallel, compressing schedules by 30 to 50%. Taken together, CLT and modular turn the delivery of housing from a cottage industry into an industrial system. Mark Carney’s Build Canada Homes plan points in exactly this direction. It targets 500,000 homes per year, financed with low cost loans and equity for prefab builders, and supported by pattern book designs that can be stamped out repeatedly across sites. The Transition Accelerator’s mass timber roadmap sets capacity goals through 2030 and 2035 that align with this vision, calling for a million cubic meters of production by 2030 and doubling that five years later. The actions are not complicated, but they require commitment. Government must act as an anchor customer by issuing multi year offtake contracts for modular CLT housing. That gives factories the volume they need to operate efficiently and pay down capital investments. Pattern books of pre approved designs must be created so that every project does not start with a blank sheet of paper. Public and private finance has to flow into the build out of 10 to 12 large regional factories, each capable of producing panels and modules at the scale required. Finally, procurement rules must reward low carbon materials. If federal and provincial governments mandate embodied carbon targets for housing, CLT will be advantaged over concrete and steel, and private developers will follow suit. The data illustrates the point. A cubic meter of CLT stores roughly a ton of CO2 from the atmosphere, while producing it emits around 120 kilograms of CO2 from harvesting, drying, adhesives, and transport. That means net storage rather than net emissions. Replacing concrete and steel with CLT in mid rise apartments can cut embodied carbon by 15 to 40% depending on the design. Build times are compressed as well. A concrete structure often takes weeks per floor as forms are set, poured, and cured. A mass timber floor can be craned into place in days. Brock Commons, the 18 storey student residence at UBC, was built in less than ten weeks for the structural portion, a pace impossible with concrete. My long term forecasts for cement and steel demand through 2100 show both materials peaking much earlier than most mainstream models anticipate and then tapering steadily for the rest of the century. The reason is not a collapse of construction but a shift in what we build with. As infrastructure build outs in China and other emerging economies slow, and as advanced economies move into maintenance rather than expansion, the structural drivers of cement and steel demand weaken. At the same time, substitution pressures grow stronger. Cross laminated timber and other mass timber products are a central lever here. Every mid rise apartment or office built in CLT instead of reinforced concrete avoids both the cement in the slabs and the rebar that would have reinforced them. That substitution compounds over decades. In my projection curves, cement demand flattens and then declines to about half of today’s levels by 2100, while steel demand bends downward as electric arc furnaces dominate a smaller total market. CLT is not the only factor, but it is one of the most powerful and immediate ways to cut into the trajectory of the two most carbon intensive building materials we use. Canada’s opportunity is twofold. Domestically, meeting the 500,000 homes per year target is only possible if housing is industrialized with mass timber and modular methods. Internationally, demand for CLT is rising quickly in the United States, Europe, and Asia, and Canada has the forest resource and technical expertise to capture a large share of that market. The risks are also clear. If we fail to build factories, if insurance and code barriers remain unresolved, or if competitors move faster, Canada could miss the window. This moment in time will not repeat itself. Other countries are already scaling their mass timber industries. The argument for CLT and modular as Canada’s fastest lever is not speculative. It is grounded in the numbers on housing starts, embodied emissions, and build time compression. It is reinforced by policy commitments from the federal government and by industry roadmaps that chart the path to scale. The task now is to align policy, finance, and industry action so that Canada moves from demonstrations and pilot projects to a mainstream manufacturing system for housing. If we succeed, we will ease the housing crisis, cut embodied carbon, and establish a new advanced manufacturing sector that can compete globally. This series of articles will explore in depth how that transformation can be achieved, from Carney’s housing initiative to export strategy, from steel and cement demand shifts to decarbonizing the forestry supply chain, and from Indigenous led stewardship to investor economics.

The administration, led by true believers likeChris Wright, the current Energy Secretary, and Doug Burgum, the current Interior Secretary, likes to pooh pooh climate change. Recently, Wright acknowledged that climate change is happening, but claimed it is far from being the most serious challenge facing the United States. There are lots of other challenges — such as relegating Black and Brown people to their proper places and passing new Jim Crow laws to keep them there. Perhaps it is time to flip the script. Instead of yammering on about melting ice caps and starving polar bears — concepts that many people seem to have difficulty wrapping their heads around — maybe it is time to put the spotlight on the harm fossil fuels do to people. Here’s a handy example. Astudy published this weekin the journalScience Advancesclaims that extracting, transporting, refining, distributing, and burning fossil fuels causes at least NINETY THOUSAND premature deaths in the US every year. Why is that figure capitalized? Because if we just say “90,000,” there would be a tendency to skip right over the number and not internalize what it is telling us. [Editor’s note: As soon as I read it in all caps, I thought, “This is so much more impactful reading it like this. How brilliant of Steve!” —Zach] On September 11, 2001, a little over 3,000 people died in the attack on the Twin Towers. America went into a paroxysm of unfocused rage that cost the US some $3 trillion and saw more than 100,000 Iraqis killed — none of whom had the slightest connection to the horror of 9/11. Every year, more than 40,000 Americans die in automobile accidents. Even someone with my limited math skills knows that is more than the number of people who died on 9/11, but Americans seem to be impervious to the carnage taking place on the roads. They just buy bigger and heavier vehicles, plant a religious icon on the dashboard, and hope for the best. Now we know, thanks to this research, that 90,000 Americans — 20 times the number of deaths on September 11, 2001 — go to an early grave because of fossil fuel pollution every year. Perhaps if we seized on that information and publicized it aggressively, it would get people to pay attention to the carnage inflicted by our ongoing love affair with fossil fuels. The current climate change message is not getting through to quite a few people. Perhaps a change in tactics is in order? Here is the abstract to this groundbreaking research: The United States has one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries, yet the health impacts and inequities from pollutants produced along the oil and gas life cycle remain poorly characterized. Here, we model the contribution of major life cycle stages (upstream, midstream, downstream, and end-use) to air pollution and estimate the associated chronic health outcomes and racial-ethnic disparities across the contiguous US in 2017. We estimate life cycle annual burdens of 91,000 premature deaths attributable to fine particles, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. The research finds there are 10,350 pre-term births attributable to fine particulate pollution, 216,000 incidences of childhood-onset asthma cases linked to nitrogen oxide emissions (which have been characterized as subjecting human lungs to sunburn-like conditions), and 1,610 lifetime cancers attributable to hazardous air pollutants. It clearly illustrates that the burden of fossil fuel pollution falls primarily on non-whites. “Racial-ethnic minorities experience the greatest disparities in exposure and health burdens across almost all life cycle stages. The greatest absolute disparities occur for Black and Asian populations from PM2.5 and ozone, and the Asian population from NO2 and HAPs. Relative inequities are most extreme from downstream activities, especially in Louisiana and Texas.” The researchers at University College London and the Stockholm Environment Institute are the first to examine the health impacts and unequal health burdens caused by every stage of the oil and gas supply chain, from exploration to end use. “We’ve long known that these communities are exposed to such levels of inequitable exposure as well as health burden,” Karn Vohra, a postdoctoral research fellow in geography at University College London, toldThe Guardian. “We were able to just put numbers to what that looks like.” Their findings show that Indigenous and Hispanic populations are most affected by pollution from exploration, extraction, transportation, and storage; Black and Asian populations are most affected by emissions from processing, refining, manufacturing, distribution, and usage. The clearest example for that last finding is the people inSouth Memphiswho are breathing the detritus issuing from several portable methane generators powering xAI’s data center located in a former Electrolux factory. That neighborhood is predominantly Black. “What makes the study so valuable is how it dissects health impacts across the whole life cycle of oil and gas – from where it comes out of the ground to where it is combusted,” said Timothy Donaghy. He is the research director for Greenpeace USA and author of previous research on the racially uneven burdens of fossil fuel pollution. “As many studies have found before, these health burdens are not shared equally — a prime example of fossil fuel racism in action.” “What we found was striking. One in five preterm births and adult deaths are linked tofine particulate pollutionfrom oil and gas,” lead author Karn Vohra, formerly of the University College of London, toldThe Hill. “Even more concerning is that nearly 90 percent of new childhood asthma cases tied to nitrogen dioxide pollution were from this sector,” added Vohra, who is now at the University of Birmingham. Downstream effects have brought particularly dire health issues to Black communities in southern Louisiana — an area known as “Cancer Alley” — and in eastern Texas, the researchers found. The current administration gets apoplectic at the mention of diversity, equality, and inclusion policies, but the bald truth is that such areas have traditionally been “no go” zones for banks and other lenders, a practice known as redlining that has been in use since the 1930s. It has denied Black and other disadvantaged communities access to the capital needed to move away from industrial hot spots or high-traffic roadways. In addition, those communities lack the political power to oppose plans to add more oil, gas, and chemical operations in their neighborhoods. “These communities are already aware of this unjust exposure and the disproportionately large health burdens they experience,” senior author Eloise Marais, a geography professor at the University College of London, said in a statement reported byThe Hill. “Our study puts science-backed numbers on just how large these unfair exposures and health outcomes are,” she added. The data used for the study was collected in 2017, the most recent year for which a complete dataset is available. Because of the passage of time, the researchers stressed that their estimates are likely conservative. US oil and gas production has increased by 40 percent and consumption has risen by 8 percent since then. “Although our health burden results are overall conservative, these provide a foundation for future studies that could further refine quantification of disparities to support civil, community, andregulatory action,” they said. Eloise Marais toldThe Guardianshe hoped the study was “picked up by the kinds of community leaders and advocacy groups that are pushing for exposure to cleaner air. If there was a move away from reliance on oil and gas, we would experience the climate change benefits 50, 100, 200 years from today because the greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere so long, but communities would experience the health benefits immediately.” Reason enough to change the conversation. People have a hard time with abstract thinking, but how difficult is it to comprehend that 90 percent of new childhood asthma cases are linked to nitrogen dioxide pollution from oil and gas operations? Regardless of political orientation, most people will be shocked by that statistic, as well they should be. Forget about starving polar bears;let’s stop damaging the lungs of our children.

But, somehow Agriculture Secretary Brooke L. Rollins found a way. Last week she declared that banishing solar panels from two USDA loan programs will help save our vanishing farmlands. Farmland is disappearing faster than you can shake a stick at it, to be sure. Only … well … nope, solar panels are not the problem, not by a long shot. The numbers don’t lie. The US does indeed have a vanishing farmland problem. However, that’s not a solar panel problem. It’s an urban and suburban sprawl issue that has been swallowing up our nation’s agrarian past in a steady march for decade upon decade, far predating the solar industry of today. Anyone traveling the highways and byways of rural America for an extended period of time has witnessed the trend into the 21st century, with rows of crops replaced by rows of tract homes, warehouses, corporate campuses, and shopping malls. Solar panels, not so much. Take Tennessee, for example, where Rollins staged a press event to publicize her new directive. Farm conservationists list the state among those most at risk of losing land. However, the main culprit by far is real estate development, not solar panels. Nevertheless, in a press release explaining the new loan restrictions on wind turbines and solar panels, USDA stated: “Within the last 30 years, Tennessee alone has lost over 1.2 million acres of farmland and is expected to lose 2 million acres by 2027.” Wow, that’s a lot of farmland. And somehow this is connected to the loan restrictions for wind turbines and solar panels, right? Yes, that’s right, according to the USDA. “This problem is not just in Tennessee, since 2012, solar panels on farmland nationwide have increased by nearly 50%. That is why the Department is taking action,” the USDA continued in the next breath. Say what now? A 50% increase sounds pretty alarming, ermigod! Call out the National Guard! Round up the usual suspects! Two if by sea! The solar panels are coming! “Our prime farmland should not be wasted and replaced with green new deal subsidized solar panels. It has been disheartening to see our beautiful farmland displaced by solar projects, especially in rural areas that have strong agricultural heritage,” Rollins emphasized. Oh, Brooke, Brooke, Brooke. Where to begin with this? Let’s start with the numbers. As any school child knows, a 50% increase over practically nothing is still practically nothing. The real question is how much is practically nothing, and researchers at the University of Tennessee have the answers. They crunched the numbers in their state a couple of years ago and found that the total acreage taken up by utility-scale solar arrays, both in operation and under contract as of 2023, would take up only0.137% of farmland in the state, requiring somewhere in the range of just about 8,200–14,700 acres to produce a total of 1.474 gigawatts of solar energy. So much for the situation as of 2023. The researchers also took a look ahead to the coming years. They based their calculations on the rather ambitious goalpost of an additional 10 gigawatts of utility-scale solar energy set by the Tennessee Valley Authority. The TVA supplies electricity across six other states in addition to Tennessee. However, for the sake of argument, the research team based their calculation on all 10 gigawatts being located within Tennessee. The result? Still next to nothing. For an extra 10 gigawatts of clean energy from the sun, the state would have to give up another 0.52% to 0.93% of its farmland, taking into account new, more efficient solar panels that require less space to produce more energy than those installed in previous years. So, what happened to the rest of those 1.2 million acres that Rollins is so concerned about, to say nothing of the additional acres she expects Tennessee to lose over the coming years? Again, the answer is staring anyone in the face who spends any time at all driving around rural America for any amount of time. “From 1997 to 2017, Tennessee’s land in farms decreased from 11.99 million acres to 10.87 million acres, a reduction of 1.11 million acres or about 9% of Tennessee’s farmland,” the University of Tennessee researchers observed. Sure, go ahead and blame the US solar industry for the loss of 1.11 million acres of farmland in just 20 years, because solar developers were so very, very busy papering over the farms of Tennessee with solar panels from 1997 to 2017 — except, not. As of midway through last year, the state barely had600 megawatts of installed solar capacityunder its belt, including rooftop solar panels and other non-farm installations. The conservation organizationAmerican Farmland Trusthas also been tracking the vanishing farmland trend. In 2020, they issued a state-by-state report in which they listed Tennessee as the 4th-most threatened state in the US due to the loss of agricultural land topoorly planned real estate development(emphasis added). The urban sprawl visible from highways is just part of the problem. AFT analyzed 660,000 acres of agricultural land lost in Tennessee between 2001 and 2016. Approximately 78% was replaced or restricted by LDR (low density residential) development. Aside from the direct loss of farmland, AFT noted that the encroachment of both conventional sprawl and low density development drives up nearby land prices. Retiring farmers in those areas are more likely to sell their land to non-farmers who can afford to pay more. “This means that new and beginning farmers have a hard time finding land, threatening the very future of agriculture,” AFT emphasized. The real estate-related bleeding continues to this day, with Rutherford County among the hotspots in Tennessee where local land use planners are facinga torrent of oppositionfrom “home builders, real estate professionals and developers.” If the planners do manage to save some farms, it’s a day late and a dollar short. Rutherford County lost22,044 acres of farmlandbetween 2014 and 2023. Like her boss in the Oval Office, Rollins lives in alternative reality where actual problems don’t exist, and neither do their solutions. How else to explain the misdirection on solar panels? “Subsidized solar farms have made it more difficult for farmers to access farmland by making it more expensive and less available,” Rollins asserted last week, blithely ignoring every fact and figure about real estate sprawl and population growth. As if the misdirection on solar panels and real estate was not enough, Rollins and her coterie of state officials at last week’s event also conflated small-scale solar arrays with the kind ofutility-scale solar developmentthat anti-solar foes love to complain about. At the very tail end of a very long press release, USDA finally cut to the chase and named the two loan programs in question: the Rural Development Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan Program and the Rural Development Rural Energy for America Program Guaranteed Loan Program. Restricting solar panels from these two programs won’t stop farmers from leasing their land to solar developers for utility-scale solar power plants. Government solar loans and private solar leases are two entirely different and separate transactions. Instead, Rollins has only made it more difficult for farmers to afford the up-front cost of small solar arrays for their own use, on a scale consistent with the barns, sheds, silos and heavy machinery that characterize the agricultural operation of today. If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Better yet,find your representativesin Congress and let them know what you think.

In the last 20 years, installations have become bigger and cheaper. My solar array was only 1.9 kWh and cost about AU$6000. For much less, you can now get an array 3 times the size. However, at the same time as arrays have gotten bigger and cheaper, the feed-in tariff (FIT) for solar power has become miniscule. Whereas two decades ago the FIT was around 50¢ a kWh, now you are lucky to get 8¢. What to do with all that power in the middle of the day? The answer is a home battery. Prices on these have fallen, and there has been an increasing number of solar panels + batteries installed — but not nearly as fast as necessary to create high demand. The Australian federal government offers itsCheaper Home Batteriessubsidy. 30% off — what a bargain! AU$2.3 billion is on offer to subsidize the installation of small-scale battery systems (5 kWh–100 kWh) for households, businesses, and community organisations. Come and get it! And have they ever. There have been 11,500 applications for the scheme in its first 3 weeks of operation. No wonder Tesla is sending me an email every second day advertising the Powerwall. Sadly, I bought a home battery several years ago and paid twice the price for out-of-date tech. The subsidy will be reviewed at least annually and “will gradually decrease until 2030, in line with reducing battery prices.” As it should. Many households with an existing solar array are putting in batteries. According to theMelbourne Age, small-scale battery systems equivalent to South Australia’s Tesla Big Battery are being added to the grid every 8.7 days. The scheme has been in operation for about 2 months now, with Australians installing 15 MWh worth of batteries a day. A thousand batteries a day! This is five times the average in 2024. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) had predicted that this would not have been achieved even by 2035. Once again, the market is showing up professional crystal ball gazers. Is this a second revolution in home electricity? The government expects that participating households, businesses, and community organisations will be able to “reduce electricity bills by making the most of cheap and clean solar power by storing it for when it is needed.” Not only will Australians be able to use solar to power their homes during peak hours, they may even have some excess to sell back onto the grid when the prices are high. Some are predicting a return on investment in about four years. Does this mean the end of thesolar duck, or at least reduction of the solar duck? It should mean that there will be much less need for expensive gas (methane) turbines in the evening peak. Tristan Edis, director ofGreen Energy Markets,makes this salient point: “You don’t need swarms of lawyers, merchant bankers, accountants, environmental planning, people, community consultation, all the things that go into building large-scale renewables. You don’t need any approvals. You don’t need any engineers; you just need your local sparky.” At the current rate of installation, within five years, Tristan hypotheses’ that there would be 10,000MW of battery capacity installed. “That’s a big deal when you think we have 20,000MW of coal capacity [in Australia],” he adds.“[D]emand for batteries has gone nuts.” The Australian government is reviewing its emission reduction targets out to 2035. The massive uptake of home batteries and the implications it has for the grid mean that these targets could be more “ambitious.” “With existing state and territory action expected to deliver emissions cuts of between 66 per cent and 71 per cent by 2035, these findings show the Albanese government should be striving for a science-aligned target of 80 per cent [reductions] by 2035,” Australian Conservation Foundation CEO Kelly O’Shanassy said. The managing director of solar consultancy SunWiz, Warwick Johnston, said that prior to the Cheaper Home Batteries scheme, four rooftop solar arrays were being installed for each battery. Now it is one for one. The Clean Energy Regulator data show that the majority of installations (40%) are in New South Wales. Queensland has 20%, South Australia 17%, and Victoria 12%. Homeowners in NSW can also claim an extra subsidy if they connect to a virtual power plant (VPP). What about encouraging all applicants for the subsidy to be part of a VPP? That would make sense.Looks like it’s covered…. “To qualify for the battery rebate, an on-grid battery system — including its inverter — must have the technical capability to participate in a VPP, giving the consumer the option to join a VPP either at installation or in the future … consumers who choose to participate will need an ongoing internet connection. Depending on the inverter model and site conditions, additional hardware or software and permissions for site controllers to access multiple battery systems may be required, and battery retailers must inform consumers about any such requirements.” Many of my Facebook friends are installing the maximum numbers of Powerwalls allowable. I hope to bring you their stories in future articles. Like many others, they are hungry for solutions to high energy costs, and maybe they will make a little hay while the sun shines. And you never know when the next flood will come and wash away the power lines, or the next fire will burn the power poles down, orthe next cyclone will blow down the high-tension towers. This is Australia, and we are in the middle of the climate crisis.It never hurts to have a battery backup. Now, hopefully the next penny will drop. If my home battery saves me money (and doesn’t burst into flames), then it is just possible that an electric car will save me more money and will also not be flammable. After all, it is generally the same chemistry. I am hoping that this surge in home battery installations will reduce the FUD around electric vehicles and bring about a surge in the numbers of EVs on the road. Watching this massive uptake, I am wondering if it is only the price point that matters? For many Australians, the future is now more affordable and more electric.

Water reacts with iron rich magnesium and iron rich, silica poor igneous rock — ultramafic — from Earth’s mantle rocks to release hydrogen, and with the right chemistry and temperature you can raise reaction rates and collect a clean product. In the lab and in models this pathway looks promising. In the field it asks for the same muscles that shale, tight gas and enhanced geothermal developed over years. You need reliable drilling, completions, stimulation, reservoir monitoring and production operations. You also need an offtaker next door that wants steady molecules for decades. That is where the real world starts to pinch. Just as withmicrobial hydrogen underground technologyI looked at recently, what works in the lab starts to look like nonsense in the field. The geology is not where the rigs and frac spreads live. The densest service capacity in North America sits over the Permian, Eagle Ford and other shale basins. Ultramafic belts are common on maps but not in those corridors. Serpentinites — hydrated ultramafic rocks made mostly of chrysotile, lizardite, and antigorite — and ophiolites — slices of oceanic crust and upper mantle thrust onto land by tectonics —show up along the California Coast Ranges, parts of the Appalachians, pieces of the Midwest and scattered blocks in the Intermountain West. There are small overlaps in places like Four Corners or parts of Kansas and Michigan, but the center of gravity for people, pumps and suppliers is hundreds to thousands of kilometers away from many of the most prospective rocks. That distance adds cost, schedule risk and learning friction. It also increases the chance that crews cycle in and out rather than staying long enough to build a stable craft for this very specific job. Offtakers are not where the rocks are either. Methanol capacity in the United States clusters on the Gulf Coast because gas is cheap, pipelines are thick and ports are close. Ammonia looks similar, with a big Louisiana footprint and a secondary band in the Plains and Midwest to serve fertilizer demand. A world scale ammonia plant needs on the order of 176,000 tons of hydrogen per year, and a world scale methanol plant needs on the order of 200,000 tons per year. If your hydrogen source sits beside those plants you can move gas a few kilometers to a header, purify it and feed the process. If the source sits a long way from the fence line you have built a second business that must move a low density gas across long distances, or you must convert it to another carrier. That erodes the simple “field to flange” narrative that makes engineered mineral hydrogen look tidy on paper. The physics and chemistry set tight conditions that must be met and kept. Hydrogen generation is strongest when water reacts with ferrous iron to become magnetite, releasing hydrogen, which works best at a few hundred degrees Celsius. If the rock is cooler, reaction rates drop. If rust-like coatings cover the reactive rock surface, the reaction slows down. If fractures short circuit flow so that water bypasses fresh surface, rates drop. Hydrogen purity matters because surface plants become large and power hungry when they must pull hydrogen out of dilute streams. Microbes in the subsurface can consume hydrogen and lower purity. The fluids can be very alkaline, which is rough on cement and some steels. Hydrogen is tiny, diffusive and can embrittle some alloys. Every one of those issues has a mitigation, but none are yet proven at the scale and duration that offtakers and lenders require. Sustained deliverability is a hard gate. Techno economic studies often use a per well target around 175 to 200 kg of hydrogen per hour at the wellhead, with purity at or above about 65%. That is roughly 4.2 to 4.8 tons per day. Held for 20 years, one well would deliver on the order of mid tens of thousands of tons. That is a lot of rock to contact. Back of the envelope calculations using literature yields of a few kilograms of hydrogen per cubic meter of fully reacted peridotite — olivine with some pyroxene — imply that a single successful well must sweep many millions of cubic meters of reactive volume over its life. That is feasible if fracture networks stay open and if stimulation accesses new surface over time. It is not feasible if the system gets covered by a thin, stable film—like iron-oxide or carbonate — early, if the fractures close or if operations short circuit flow. The analogy to shale is not perfect, but it is instructive. Shale wells show high initial rates and then steep declines because the accessible pressure and surface area close to the well get used up. Operators hold field level output by constantly drilling new laterals and adding stages, not by expecting single wells to sit on plateau for decades. An engineered hydrogen field would need its own version of that playbook, with planned step outs, staged access to new rock and periodic maintenance interventions, all while keeping chemistry and purity in bounds. Getting to that level of operational maturity takes many at bats in a short time. Shale scaled because thousands of wells across a few big basins let teams learn fast. Fluids, proppants, stage spacing, diverters and diagnostics improved because service companies worked every week in the same places and swapped ideas at the coffee truck. Engineered mineral hydrogen does not have that runway. The United States likely has only dozens of Tier 1 prospects when you demand the full system of source rock, reservoir and seal at accessible depth. The world likely has hundreds. Many sit in regions with limited oilfield services or with policies that constrain hydraulic stimulation. You can import spreads for a hub, and one hub with 80 to 120 wells is large enough to keep a crew busy for months, but a sparse map of projects slows the learning loop. That keeps costs high, cycle times long and confidence low for longer than offtakers can tolerate. The location of demand and the structure of incentives also tilt the field. Blue hydrogen is not new chemistry. It is reforming or partial oxidation of natural gas paired with capture and storage of carbon dioxide. It lives where gas lives, which is often the same place methanol and ammonia plants already sit. It connects to existing hydrogen pipelines and to salt cavern storage in some regions. It uses standard compressors and purification blocks. Policy in many countries supports carbon capture with long lived credits or contracts for difference. Policy for clean hydrogen sometimes supports any low carbon source, sometimes adds strict lifecycle accounting rules and sometimes narrows the window for project starts. In gas rich regions the mix of plant locations, pipeline access and policy support tends to make blue hydrogen easier to bank. The spread between modeled engineered mineral hydrogen costs and blue hydrogen costs is not large. Small misses on flow rate or purity can erase it. Lenders look at that spread and see risk. Regulation matters as much as geology and cost. Some states have broad restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, and many jurisdictions in Europe do as well. That does not stop all forms of stimulation, but it adds time and uncertainty. Electrical reservoir stimulation is promising and avoids some of the issues that drive water based fracturing opposition, but it still requires deep wells, high voltage equipment, rigorous monitoring and a receptive regulator. Developers can thread those needles in a few places, but it is not a recipe for fast replication across many basins. A development model that depends on new offtake plants standing up beside first of a kind subsurface systems in jurisdictions that are learning on the job is a hard sell. It is fair to ask what would have to be true for engineered mineral hydrogen to deserve plant scale offtake. The list is short and clear. A field trial would need to hold per well rates at or above the target with stable purity for a year, not a month. It would need to show that chemical or thermal maintenance restores performance when passivation or microbes drag it down. It would need to show that restimulation can reach new rock from the same pad without losing containment or purity. It would need to run a small hub of several dozen wells into a plant header and prove that the gathering, compression and purification work at scale without surprise outages. It would need to do all of that in a place where policy is steady and where service depth is real, and it would need to line up an offtaker that is willing to sign for 15 to 20 years. That is a tall stack. It is not impossible, but it is rare in extraction history for new subsurface systems to jump straight to bankable on the first or second try. There are glimmers of hope for some of this. Utah Forge and Fervo are experimenting with fracturing hard crystalline rock for enhanced geothermal, whichmy assessmentsuggests is a field rife with black swans. There might be some transferability from that to engineered mineral hydrogen. But it doesn’t move the skilled resources or the methanol and shale plants to the good ultramafic zones. Firms pursuing engineered mineral hydrogen include Vema Hydrogen, Halliburton, EXLOG, and Eden GeoPower, each working to stimulate water–rock reactions in ultramafic formations to produce hydrogen at scale, and a couple are big established oilfield services companies, presumably trying to find something to do with their kit and people with the decline of shale oil and gas looming, and in factalready pinching this year. None of this writes off the underlying chemistry. Water rock reactions make hydrogen naturally. Ultramafics are common worldwide. Small pilots are worth doing well, with careful measurement and open publication of results. There is a possible path where engineered mineral hydrogen fills niche markets, proves out a handful of rock types and develops a small but capable service craft. The claim that it will anchor world scale ammonia and methanol offtake in the next investment cycles needs more than promise. It needs long, clean data and a simple story for crews, plants and regulators in the places we actually build things. And, of course, the premise that dozens of good sites in the US and hundreds globally might turn into a new energy source should be treated as ludicrous hyperbole. In a world arranged differently this could look better. If ultramafic belts sat under the Gulf Coast and if ammonia and methanol plants were scattered across those belts, the learning curve might be short and the offtake risk small. In the world we have, the rigs and crews are in shale regions. The big chemical plants are near gas hubs and ports. Many of the ultramafic targets are somewhere else. Fracking ultramafic rock economically will take many cycles of trial and error, and there are not enough project sites in friendly places to climb that curve fast. The economics between engineered mineral hydrogen and blue hydrogen are close, and the policy and regulatory picture pushes capital toward blue in the same corridors. That combination makes first of a kind engineered mineral hydrogen hubs with long term offtake unlikely to reach bankability soon, if ever. If a developer proves otherwise with sustained rates, steady purity and a contract next door, that would be a welcome result. Until then, the prudent read is that engineered mineral hydrogen might be technically and economically viable in another world, and that in this one it faces a map and a market that point to a different outcome. is a climate futurist, strategist and author.

I used to drive a first generation Nissan Leaf that had a 24kWh battery, so I am always fascinated to see plug-in hybrids (PHEV) with larger batteries. An example of this is the new Chery Tiggo 9 Super Hybrid PHEV that Chery says is a “masterful synthesis of plug-in hybrid innovation and exquisite design artistry.” This model, known as the Tiggo 9 CSH Vanguard, has a 34.4kWh battery pack, but Chery also has the 18.3kWh Tiggo 9 CSH Pinnacle. The Vanguard has a stated range of 160km in EV mode and 1,400km combined with the 1.5L turbo engine. The Pinnacle has a stated range of 90km in electric mode. The Pinnacle starts from R839,900, and the Vanguard starts from R989,900. The Chery Group, and its brands that include Omoda, Jaecoo, and Jetour, is doing extremely well in the overall South African market and is up to fourth place in July 2025, only behind Toyota, Suzuki, and Volkswagen. Legacy automakers with a presence in South Africa have been very slow to introduce plug-ins. Chery, on the other hand, has taken the initiative among the newer brands in the country to introduce plug-in hybrids. There are a growing number of plug-in hybrids with electric ranges above 100km that are now being offered in South Africa by these Chinese manufacturers, and these seem to be winning over some consumers. Among the Chinese brands, Chery appears to be leading this transition, offering plug-in hybrids at reasonable prices, and the South African market seems to be responding well to this. These offer consumers more value than the older generation PHEVs from some other markets that had electric ranges of less than 40km in real driving conditions. A lot of people commute between Pretoria, Centurion, Midrand, and Johannesburg, and PHEVs with a real range of over 90km will offer great value. A lot of people now also have solar at home, and charging these PHEVs with solar makes the value proposition financially stronger. Thanks to Chery & Co, there are more PHEV options with decent all-electric range available now in South Africa, and this could be one of the main reasons driving the growth in sales, whereas a few years ago, the few PHEV models available mostly had real electric ranges of around 50km and below. So with a claimed range of 160km in electric mode, this Tiggo 9 Vanguard should do well. Its more premium cousin, the Omoda C9, has a similar sized battery pack (34.46kWh) and a range of 150km, which is close to the Chery Tiggo 9. The Omoda C9 is priced from R999,000 and has been well received in South Africa. This should give an indication of how well the Tiggo 9 could do in South Africa. The Vanguard has motors giving a combined output of 455 kW. The torque is listed as 920 Nm. As more PHEVs enter the South African market, let’s take a look at the overall market and see the current state of the market. Vehicle Sales In South Africa From January to June 2025 As shown in the table above, vehicle sales in the overall market were up 14% YoY in the first 6 months of 2025. 278,890 vehicles were sold in South Africa in the first 6 months of the year. 97.4% of those were full ICE vehicles followed by plug-less HEVs with 2%. PHEVs had a market share of just 0.28% and BEVs had a market share of only 0.2%. Looking at the YoY performance, HEVs were down 6%, BEVs also took a heavy knock, down 24% YoY. PHEV sales experienced explosive growth, albeit from a very small base. PHEVs were up a whopping 162%. With more companies, especially the Chinese automakers, launching longer range PHEVs, sales of PHEVs look set to grow even further in the second half of the year. Legacy automakers should look at this trend carefully. Let’s look at Toyota, for example. Toyota South Africa appears to be favoring plug-less hybrids (HEV) over PHEVs. A look at the sales for H1 2025 supports this. From January 2025 to June 2025, Toyota South Africa sold a whopping 4,257 HEVs and only 4 plug-in hybrids. Yes, just 4 plug-in hybrids. The 4 were all Toyota Rav 4 PHEVs. Which is a real shame, as the PHEV Rav 4 is doing quite well in other markets around the world and it has decent electric range from its 18.1kWh battery. On the flipside, Toyota sold 521 Rav 4 HEVs. That’s a lot of HEVs compared with the PHEVs sold. The other popular HEV during this period was the Toyota Corolla Cross and it sold 3,374 units in the first 6 months of 2025. Toyota could singlehandedly boost the plug-in market in South Africa if it actually tries to promote them more. Toyota is the number one brand in South Africa by a significant margin. Also the PHEV Rav 4 has an 18.1kWh battery, similar to the Chery Tiggo 9 Pinnacle, however, Chery also offers a longer range Vanguard with a 34kWh battery pack. Something for Toyota to learn from Chery. HEV sales (dominated by Toyota South Africa) fell 6% in the first 6 months of 2025 in an overall vehicle market that is up 14% and PHEVs up 162%. Perhaps it’s time for Toyota to relook at its strategy for plug-ins in this market. Driving around South Africa you see prominent billboards of PHEVs like Chery Group’s Omoda C9. There are automakers going all out to promote PHEVs over HEVs and I think this messaging will grow and have a huge impact on adoption. These kinds of longer range PHEVs could just be what could help win over a huge percentage of the population that may still not be too sure about going all-electric. They could do most of their daily drive in electric mode and use the ICE component on longer trips. Chances are they will see that going all-electric is a better option and switch to BEV on their next purchase. This new generation of PHEVs could be the transition vehicles PHEVs were thought to be in the beginning. Remeredzai Joseph Kuhudzai has been fascinated with batteries since he was in primary school.

Their awnings are much like a traditional roll-up shade awning for RVs, but with integrated, flexible solar panels that are designed to withstand the rigors of RV life and the wide range of weather conditions that come with it. The awnings can be sized widthwise by adding more of the roll up flexible panels to the awning to extend it further. They showcased a typical awning at RE+ with three of their roll-up solar panels integrated into it for a rated output of 800-900 watts of solar in ideal conditions. As an awning, Eco-dynamic’s offering delivers, with motorized action and integrated LED lighting which makes setting up camp that much easier. In addition, it provides invaluable shade while putting in some extra work to produce electricity for your auxiliary battery system at the same time. Because the awnings are built with Eco-dynamic’s flexible roll-up solar panels, they can be custom sized to suit the physical dimensions desired for the awning. Functionally, the solar awning would replace the awning typically found on the side of larger RVs, but with the added benefit of putting out power while it sits in the sun. It’s a great combination that makes it easy for RV owners or others looking to add a motorized awning to their build. Looking farther ahead into the future, it’s not hard to imagine a solar awning pushing power directly into the traction battery of a fully electric RV. 1,000 watts of additional solar production isn’t going to replace a DC fast charger anytime soon, but it’s clearly a meaningful amount of output for any electric vehicle. As of today, these solar panels are primarily designed to be used to charge the house battery and would not be well suited to directly charge an electric vehicle. This is primarily due to the lack of a DC to DC mppt charger that would make good use of the solar. Eco-dynamic’s core technology is the flexible roll-up solar panels that are used in the awnings, but they also make them in a wide range of sizes. They offer panels starting with a portable roll-up 40 watt solar panel that could be used on a backpacking or camping trip to keep your device charged up. Ramping up, they have a 220 watt roll-up panel that can be used in an awning configuration, as well as a larger 300 watt roll-up solar panel which was being used in their awning on display. These can be purchased as standalone solar panels or in a fully built awning. Eco-dynamic primarily sells systems directly to RV manufacturers, trailer builders, and the like. They are currently selling their 800 watt “Artpiece for RV” motorized awningon their websitefor $3,799. For more information about Eco-dynamic’s solar awnings head over totheir official website.

Still, the odds are against the US playing a significant role in the global space solar race, considering the topsy-turvy state of affairs over at the White House, where US President Donald Trump lives rent-free in a grass-covered, gold-plated world of his own invention. Grass has been much in the news this week, after the President touched upon the subject during a live television appearance in Washington, DC. However, let’s get to the latest space solar news first. Space-based solar power refers to technology that enables solar energy to be beamed down from the Sun to Earth on a 24/7 basis, regardless of the weather or time of day. Thetechnology piecesare at hand and the field is attractinginvestor interestas well as government support, with Europe, China, and Japan among the hotspots (see more space solarbackground here). Here in the US, the Department of Energy continues to providelip serviceto space solar on its website, but the action steps are spread among multiple federal agencies, all of which are subject to the whims of a Commander-in-Chief who appears to be increasingly out of touch with his surroundings. Returning to the topic of space solar, though, let’s be fair. If the President or anyone else in a position of authority suddenly began talking about space solar just a few years ago, they may have easily sparked a dementia alert on social media. The renowned US author Isaac Asimov popularized the idea of sending concentrated beams of solar energy down to Earth from outer space back in the 1940s, but even well into this century the goal of freeing the Earth from the on the on-again, off-again vagaries of ambient sunlight seemed far out of reach. Much water has passed under the bridge since 2011, when the philanthropists Donald and Brigitte Bren kickstarted action in the US space solar field with a donation to CalTech totalingmore than $100 million. “Northrup Grumman chipped in$12.5 million for several years, and thethe US Air Forceandthe US Navyhave also been exploring the space solar field,”CleanTechnicanoted last year. Leading up to this year, US Department of Energy has also played a key role through its support for perovskite solar cell research, among other fields. Last year NASA took stock of the situation and noted that their currentportfolio of activitiesincluded wireless power beaming among other supportive technologies, though direct funding for specific space-to-Earth activity was not in the cards. With NASA and DOE joining other federal agencies under the Trump chopping block, the odds are against further action on the part of the US government, at least for the time being. That leaves the field wide open for other nations to pile on, and a newly published study from a research team at King’s College London has just added fuel to the fire. “Space-based solar panelscould enable solar power to be harvested continuously instead of only when sunlight reaches Earth, reducing Europe’s need for Earth-based wind and solar by 80%,” Kings College explains. The study was published in the peer-reviewed journalJouleunder the title, “Assessspace-based solar powerfor European-scale power system decarbonization.” Of course there’s a catch, and that’s where NASA comes back into the picture. Kings College notes that if space solar is to play a significant role in Europe’s 2050 decarbonization goal, two of NASA’s supportive technologies must be called into action, the Innovative Heliostat Swarm and the Mature Planar Array. Neither one is in a ready state at this time. “The heliostat design is in the early stages of development but has higher potential to continuously capture solar energy, whereas the simpler planar array is closer to being technologically ready but can only capture solar energy around 60% of the time,” Kings College observes. Even 60% of the time sounds a lot better than the limited availability of sunlight on Earth, but the numbers don’t work out economically, which leaves the Innovative Heliostat Swarm to hold the torch. Based on costs projected by NASA, the Kings College team assessed that the heliostat design would outperform both wind and terrestrial solar by 2050. “Overall, the model estimated that the heliostat design would reduce total system costs by 7%–15%, offset up to 80% of wind and solar, and reduce battery usage by over 70%, though hydrogen storage would still be vital in the winter months for some regions,” the school summarized. Still, Mature Planar Array fans need not lose hope. The research team supports the idea of deploying near-term technological readiness as a stepping stone to longer-term solutions. Whether or not any of NASA’s space solar technology is available to anyone, anywhere, is up to the Commander-in-Chief. However, the current priority of the day appears to be grass, grass, and more grass. The urgent need for grass was on full display on Thursday, when the President went on live television to speak about the crisis in Washington, DC. Or not, as the case may be. Whether it was a simple failure to read the room, additional evidence of a slide into dementia, or something else entirely, the President — who recently ordered the Rose Gardengrass to be replaced with stone— used the occasion to pledge a soup-to-nuts makeover of all the parks in Washington, DC with brand new grass, and not just any old new grass. In widely reported remarks, he promised a leveling up to the standard of a Trump National Golf Club, such as it is (for the record, there is more than one Trump National Golf Club in the US). Thursday’s rumination upon grass was more than a little off-topic considering the chaotic state of affairs in the nation’s capitol, where a Soviet-style takeover of the local police department is well underway complete with military occupiers helicoptered in from at least four states —Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina — that tried and failed to take DC by force all the way back in 1860. Whelp, second time’s a charm. Nevertheless, the President insisted on drawing attention to, of all things, grass. “We’re going to bere-grassing all your parks, all brand new sprinkler systems, the best that you can buy,” the President said. “I know more about grass than any human being I think anywhere in the world,” he continued, adding that grass “has a life. You know that? Grass has a life. We have a life, and grass has a life.” Image: Space solar technology could provide the Earth with24/7 power, regardless of the weather or the season (via CalTech).

The latest sign of fresh activity involves a new collaboration between the leading online solar marketplace EnergySage, the software-enabled buyer’s guide WattBuy, and the EV charging firm Qmerit. All three are now joined in the building decarbonization movement under the umbrella of the sprawling legacy firm Schneider Electric. The all-electric building of the future began to emerge in the early 20th century, but the journey to mass adoption has been long and slow. Most US households continue to burn gas, oil, propane, or wood for heat and hot water, with electricity pulling duty for other appliances. As of 2020, only 26% of US households usedelectricity as their one and only energy source, and most of them are concentrated in warm-climate states to the south. There’s a good reason for that. Electricity is a pricey way to run a heating system compared to natural gas and other fuels. Still, the building electrification movement has been growing in recent years with an assist from 21st century technologies including heat pumps as well as solar panels, energy storage, and electric vehicles. Innovation on the developer side also support the building electrification movement, with newmodular construction systemsamong the examples. Advocates also like to point out thatall-electric buildingsspare developers from the additional expense of arranging for gas connections. For that matter, some jurisdictions have forced the issue by placing outright bans on new gas hookups. Schneider Electric has been working on the three-way collaboration for several years, having previously formed a partnership with Qmerit and acquiring EnergySage. The acquisition of WattBuy, announced earlier this week, rounds out the decarbonization mission. “The acquisition will strengthen Schneider Electric’s ability to simplify and accelerate the energy transition for U.S. homeowners,” Schneider explained in a press statement. You can say that again.WattBuybrings a potential reach of more than 100 million households to the collaboration through its relationships with the home ownership stakeholders Redfin, Veterans United Home Loans, and Opendoor among others. Redfin, for example, has partnered with WattBuy to provide potential home buyers with an estimate of a home’s monthly electricity bills. WattBuy recommends electrification strategies for individual buildings through a free portal on their website. All they need is a street address (or zip code, if preferred), and they will provide company-specific recommendations for rooftop solar and storage systems among other electrical appliances. They also identify any available demand-response plans and community solar systems opportunities. Try ithere. EnergySage is a transparency-focused online marketplace that enables ratepayers to compare products and vendors without reinventing the wheel, and Qmerit brings its top-rated EV charger installation services to the mix. “Combined with EnergySage’s trusted marketplace and Qmerit’s national service network, Schneider Electric now offers an unmatched digital and physical pathway for electrifying the home,” Schneider explains. “This acquisition underscores Schneider Electric’s commitment to decarbonization at the grid edge and to delivering simple, scalable tools that accelerate the energy transition for consumers across the country,” The company emphasizes. If you caught that thing about decarbonization at the grid edge, that’s one way of letting everyone know that building decarbonization is its own thing. The electricity that comes into the building is another thing entirely. Ideally, it would come from one, or a combination of, the renewable resources that the US is favored with in abundance, with wind and solar coming out on top due to their affordability, accessibility and rapid construction timelines, followed bynew geothermal systemsover the longer term, withhydropowereventually chipping in through existing dam upgrades and new pumped storage projects. The US also has biomass in abundance, but the industry has faced some tough challenges in recent years. All in all, the renewable energy picture still looked bright as of March, when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a near-term forecast through the end of 2027. The agency anticipated thatthe US gridwould add more than 89 gigawatts of utility-scale solar and more than 22 gigawatts of wind by January of 2028. Although the new “American Energy Dominance” policy does support three other forms of utility-scale renewable energy — hydropower, geothermal, and biomass — FERC did not anticipate much activity in those sectors by 2028. Hydropower came in at just 1.3 gigawatts, reflecting the industry’s limited opportunities for expansion as well as its long construction timelines. The similarly constrained geothermal industry registered 89 megawatts. As for generating electricity from biomass, FERC anticipated that the industry will continue to shrink, not grow. With the data center construction boom in full swing, one would think that wind and solar would gain even more support from federal policy makers, particularly solar. After all, last year solar accounted for more than 90% ofnew capacity additions. However, every day is opposite day in the federal energy policy environment of today. The wind industry is now all but banished from federal property, including the all-importantoffshore lease areas. The solar industry has been likewise 86’d from federal lands. Opportunities remain among non-federal jurisdictions and private properties, but local opponents have gained fresh fuel from the White House. Wind and solar developers will have to tread more carefully than ever. On the bright side, the building decarbonization movement provides an opening for the rooftop solar industry to stay afloat until January 20, 2029, when the reins of federal energy policy will pass to another pair of hands — peacefully this time, one hopes. After all, US presidents come and go, but buildings can last for decades or even centuries. The US is already populated with millions of buildings, and millions of rooftops, that will stick around long after the current federal energy policy slides into the dustbin of history. The firmWood Mackenzie is among those crunching the numbers to see green gold in the rooftop solar movement over the long term. Earlier this month they calculated that the market potential market for the residential rooftop solar sector alone could reachapproximately 1,494 gigawattsby 2050. For other signs of a more energy-positive future, keep an eye on heat pumps,bidirectional EV charging, and other technologies at work in the building decarbonization movement. Policies change, but the technology is not going anywhere.

This should not be a surprise to anyone who has been following BYD closely. Its 120,000+ R&D engineers currently submit an average of 45 patent applications and have 20 patents awarded per day. R&D spend is consistently higher than net profits. If you see BYD patent announcements in your news feed, there is clearly a lot going on. Even though many of the company’s patents are for other parts of its diverse business and do not appear on these lists, BYD has built a significant lead in EV intellectual property (IP). At this rate, the gap is poised to widen. Looking at the different lists, far more attention is being paid to BEV IP, with over 9 times as many patents compared to hybrids. While BYD overtaking Toyota’s previous lead in hybrid patents has historical significance, the BEV numbers are far more impactful. BYD clearly wanted you to pay attention to their position at the top, and the organization compiling the list wanted you to pay attention to national origin (we’ll get back to that). However, there are other interesting aspects to the ranking, especially when focusing on just BEVs. Toyota comes in at second with less than half as many BEV patents compared to BYD. However, it is interesting to see Toyota, as well as Honda at fourth, so prominently placed. We have tended to see them as a bit behind in the BEV market. In addition, Toyota has technology partnerships with BYD and FAW at fifth. As such, Toyota has access to significant BEV IP if it decides to put it to use. Beijing New Energy Vehicle Company, a division of BAIC Group, takes third position. While BAIC hasn’t seen as much attention lately, it partners with big names like Huawei, Canadian supplier Magna, Hyundai (#10), and Daimler. And it also makes its own brands, like Arcfox. BAIC was also recently found to have had the highest level of NEV subsidies to automakers in China from 2016 to 2022,over ⅓ of the total, which likely helped to fund its R&D (BYD, for comparison, received less than 1%). Following state-owned FAW, private sector Great Wall comes in at #6, while Geely comes in at #8. While these are two of BYD’s fiercest competitors in the market, they trail significantly in patents. Also, toward the bottom of the top 10 are Ford and GM. While their BEV commitment can sometimes come into question, similar to Toyota, they have clearly invested in developing the technology, and we can hope to see new innovations on the road in the coming years. At this stage, I think it is important to temper the emphasis on patent count a bit. Not all patents are created equal. Some seem to be a significant breakthrough, while others seem to be a relatively minor tweak to existing technology. However, especially when looking at abstracts out of context, what can seem to be relatively minor could be a significant breakthrough, and vice versa. Companies also apply for patents for different reasons. Sometimes it is to protect the technology of a product that they are introducing to the market. For BYD’s U7 technology showcase, for example, I seemed to be seeing many of the technologies in the car appearing as patent announcements while the vehicle was being displayed to the public. However, there are a wide range of patent strategies. Some offensive strategies focus on patenting an idea as early as possible to try to prevent competitors from developing those ideas. Some of those ideas never make it to market, like many of the fascinating inventions in thePopular Sciencemagazines that I read growing up. Sometimes, the intention of the patent is to license technology, rather than to produce it. Sometimes, companies will file for patents to prevent other companies with similar ideas from suing them for patent infringement. However, regardless of the strategy, patent count indicates an effort to develop and secure intellectual property. There are ways to build a viable company without controlling the patents. Companies can license technology, form partnerships, or access the technology through supplier relationships (like the above-mentioned Magna). Newer automakersHuawei and Xiaomi, for example, have focused patents on intelligent driving and connectivity, while also benefitting from EV technology developed with partners.But having IPisan advantage. Turning that advantage into a marketable, reliable, and profitable product is another challenge. As Edison is credited with saying, “Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.” Simply developing the idea enough to obtain a patent does not guarantee success. The organization publishing the lists was clearly emphasizing China’s lead in EV patent count, with BYD as the top company. Beyond sheer patent count, theNew York Timesalso examined China’s expanding lead in high-quality global patents and published research. Going from “copycat” to “innovator.” The effort put into legally securing intellectual property is in stark contrast to the persistent accusations that China is just stealing US IP. And the shift in patents indicates that the old model of Chinese companies relying on technology from JV partners is no longer the case. They should feel proud of that progress, but it is just part of the bigger picture. While it is easy to think about this in terms of competition, the proliferation of new patents also means that a lot of effort is being put into innovation around electric vehicles. That innovation is also an opportunity. Through licensing, partnerships, and supplier relationships, more advanced technology can be accessed. New inventions can also be built upon the innovations of others, even if a licensing agreement is needed for the foundational technology that underlies them. Companies are not just claiming a piece of the technology pie, but also making the pie much bigger. While those who are trying to close themselves off from the world might feel threatened, the potential for global collaboration based on the increasing flow of innovation is a reason to be optimistic.

Rather than responding to ridiculous distortions of our political system with statements about how Republicans are violating norms, degrading our democracy, and going against the will of the people, they have decided to fight fire with fire this time. If you’ve been following US politics in the slightest, you surely know about what’s been going on in Texas with congressional redistricting, but if that’s not your beat, here’s a quick summary to catch up: President Donald Trump reportedly pushed Texas Republicans to increase Republican power and seats in Congress. In response, they basically said,sure thing, we’ll just redraw congressional maps in Texas and add several more Republicans to the US Congress. Aside from blatant problems ofgerrymandering, redrawing these congressional maps normally happens at the beginning of the decade, not in the middle of the decade. Republicans are blatantly breaking more norms of our democracy by deciding they’ll just go ahead and redraw their maps mid-decade in order to gain an advantage in Congress. Republicans are expected to gain 5 seats in the US House of Representatives from this move. California Governor Gavin Newsom decided to step up to the plate and respond to this. Instead of just letting Republicans blatantly take more power via funky map making, simply responding with statements about how this is wrong and why Republicans shouldn’t be cheating and distorting our political structure like this, he said,okay, if you want to play that way, we can play that way too. Newsom decided California would just do the same thing in order to neutralize Republicans’ move. Does this put us down a more dangerous path? Possibly. But you can’t fight fire with paper. For once, Democrats are fighting fire with fire. What other option is there? On Tuesday, at a fundraiser for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, former President Barack Obama backed Newsom up. “I believe that Governor Newsom’s approach is a responsible approach,”Obama said. “I think that approach is a smart, measured approach, designed to address a very particular problem in a very particular moment in time.” Indeed. It’s not normal times, and we can’t respond in normal ways. If the MAGA party is going to use a particular tool in an abnormal way in order to wrest more power for their side, it’s most sensible for Democrats to do the same. What’s the alternative? What’s the legitimate alternative? “We cannot unilaterally allow one of the two major parties to rig the game,” Obama added. “And California is one of the states that has the capacity to offset a large state like Texas.” Obama also pushed Democrats to address gerrymandering in the longer term in order to make our election system more democratic again. However, that’s a hugely difficult problem that he and others have been trying to fix for years. Democrats can’t just say, “we’re going to stop gerrymandering because it’s wrong,” and then allow Republicans to do it, gaining more and more seats in government. “Given that Texas is taking direction from a partisan White House that is effectively saying: gerrymander for partisan purposes so we can maintain the House despite our unpopular policies, redistrict right in the middle of a decade between censuses — which is not how the system was designed; I have tremendous respect for how Governor Newsom has approached this,” Obama also said. We are in extreme times. Trump and Republicans are repealing basic programs, policies, and even legal rulings meant to protect the United States public from pollution, from toxic chemicals, from unsafe corporate practices, and from financial abuse and recklessness. They are doing this much more so than Republicans would have evenconsidereddoing 10, 20, or 30 years ago. It’s brazen destruction of things put in place out of common sense and from scientific evidence, but it suits the financial interests of certain billionaires in the Republican Party, and what else matters? It’s just a consistent, truly absurd attack on the logic and democratic progress that did make the United States great. But people aren’t paying attention, much more interested in social media distractions and obscure gender topics that will likely never have anything to do with their actual lives. So, the cancerous actions continue, and the erosion of our representative republic accelerates. This redistricting controversy is just one element of our ongoing political crisis. It’s a relief that, for once, Democrats are not sitting back and discussing it as if we are living in normal times while letting Republicans mutate and deform our political balance. “This isn’t politics as usual,”said California Democratic Assemblymember Anamarie Avila Fariasthis week. “This is an emergency for our state. This is an emergency for our country. This is an emergency for democracy.” Indeed. It is. FeaturedimagebyWelcome to All ! ツfromPixabay Zach is tryin' to help society help itself one word at a time.

Serial entrepreneur and attention seeker Arran Blomfield ofRegenEVhas gone all out and bought himself ared MG Cyberster. “Well,” I quipped, “if you are going to have a midlife crisis, a sports car is cheaper than a blonde.” No only that, but it is a great way of advocating for electric vehicles and advertising his business. The eye-catching MG Cyberster cost Arran AU$120,000 and will do 0–100 km/h in 2.4 seconds. “Roadster-like acceleration for a fraction of the cost,” he tells me. Not that you can buy a Tesla Roadster anywhere, let alone in Australia. The two-seater has discreet signage — “100% electric” on the side, “RegenEV” on the back. Believe it or not, it is a work vehicle, complementing RegenEV’s electric fleet of Teslas and the Mercedes eVito. The MG Cyberster is used when doing quotes for EV charging installs. All his customers rave about the vehicle. He has offered to give them rides, but so far no one has taken him up on it.CleanTechnicapublished about the Mercedes eVitohere. In eco mode, Arran tells me he can get a range of approximately 480 km, but if he uses sports mode (and why wouldn’t you!), he loses 100 km. Still pretty decent figures for a sports car. He travels from the Gold Coast (south of Brisbane, Queensland) to the Sunshine Coast (north of Brisbane) and back (about 350 km) and still has 20 km in tank. “Nothing compares to this car,” he tells me. “It is very efficient, with great tech. The car says hello, tells you the weather (helpful if you are thinking about putting the top down), the date and the time. It even has ambient lighting.” MG has certainly come a long way since the MG ZS EV came out not so long ago. Although the boot is only half the size of the boot on the Tesla Model 3 that Arran used to drive to do his quotes, it is ample for his toolbag, paperwork, and portable charger with 7 m type 2 lead. Recently, Arran was called out to assess a tricky installation of an EV charging device. Imagine his surprise when he found that a neighbour also owned a Cyberster! Quite a coincidence when only 38 have been sold in Australia this year. “What’s the chance, you are quoting across the road and this lovely car pulls up. This is the first Cyberster that I have seen on the road other than mine of course. We’ll have to start a Cyberster car club!” You can watch the videohereor below. Arran’s Cyberster was featured recently at the Zero Emissions Noosa EV Expo, where he was interviewed by none other than Sam Evans, The Electric Viking. Arran tells me that he finds the MG a “stunning car — joy to drive.” He wants to be in it all the time. Although he has owned the car for 3 months now, he has rarely had the roof down. It is the Australian winter after all. “It is too cold at the moment for the roof down. It will be summer soon and then roof will come down.” He describes how the car is mobbed when he and his wife, Nat, take it shopping at the local supermarket. “All these young kids screaming out ‘cool car!’ The scissor doors really make an impression.” The car makes Nat feel classy. A bit like Grace Kelly, perhaps. Even more so than when she used to drive her Model X. She comments that the MG drives like a Model 3 Performance when it comes to acceleration and regen braking. These pubic reactions remind me of the reception we used to get for our Tesla Model 3 when driving past the local school. Teslas are common now, and the MG Cyberster is the exciting new kid on the block. People even stare as Arran drives the Cyberster down the street in Brisbane’s CBD. Not everyone in the family is keen on the attention. Nat has to be discreet when dropping her younger daughter at school. She insists on being dropped a few streets away to avoid the stares that the Cyberster attracts. “It’s too fancy!” Mind you, Nat tells me that it was the same when she did the school dropoff in the Model X. So, where do they house this exotic beast of a car? In a solar carport, of course. Although it is still a work in progress, you can see the videohere. Currently Arran is still charging his Cyberster from the 20 kW solar array on his roof. When the carport is fully functional and he has fitted a few Tesla Powerwall’s (there are subsidies from the newFederal Cheaper Home Batteries Program), Arran expects to be able to go off grid. Goodweapproached RegenEV with the prospect of setting up a “display solar car port as a showcase.” Arran needed extra weather protection for the MG and so accepted their offer. The car is protected and powered by the same structure. Arran expects to be able to supply and install the product as part of his business portfolio. I asked if he had had any visitors yet — thinking that perhaps it could become another Gold Coast Tourist attraction, but he tells me, “Not yet.” Nat tells me that she will be excited when it is all up and running. The first stage is complete. It took about a week for four RegenEV employees to erect the carport, using an existing concrete slab. The kit was shipped in and the parts easily bolted together. Fifteen solar panels make up the roof. I queried the weight, compared to a regular roof. With each panel weighing 20 kg, all up, the roof weighs 300 kg, ably supported by 4 alloy posts (150 x 100 mm) with 150 x 150 mm joists. Similar engineering to any other carport. The next stage will be to set up the electricals. Arran plans to connect the solar panels and then pull the cables to an all-in-one hybrid battery, inverter, and EV charger. He is still searching for the best product to do this job. He also plans to install power points. He sees GoodWe’s Solar Carport Solution perfect for those who are living off grid, who can’t put solar on the roof, or who have maxed out their roof space and still need more power. Perhaps even for the small business that can fit one in their carpark. Providing shelter and power might make them valuable for public charging stations! I recently checked the cost of installing solar panels vs. shade cloth as the local shopping centre is renovating. Turns out that it costs four times as much. Arran expects that a solar carport may cost twice as much as a regular one, but you would balance this with the return on investment from power generation and use. There you have it — another great idea for generating renewable energy, and this time to power your funmobile. For Arran, his family, and RegenEV, the future is bright, electric, fast, classy and fun. As MG says: The future of driving is here, and it is electrifying!

Three years ago, when the price of battery-grade lithium was soaring into the stratosphere and supply chain interruptions were affecting industries all around the globe, LFP batteries were costing manufacturers €127 per kilowatt-hour, with NMC batteries costing then €140 per kilowatt-hour — both more than double their cost today. Schwarzer writes that as cell prices continuing to fall, the global ramp-up of electric vehicle production is “not only ecologically inevitable but also economically. Therefore the success of electric cars is inevitable if the economic advantage becomes clear across more and more markets and scenarios…..which is roughly the situation today.” At today’s prices, the 81 kWh battery for a Kia EV3 costs the manufacturer €4,700. “We expect prices to fall by a further 10 to 15 per cent by 2030, ” Miller says. “Further price reductions will come partly from capacity expansions at factories and partly from production process improvements as well as modifications in cell chemistry.” That is wonderful news for companies like CATL and BYD which can build batteries in China and import them to European customers, but it is not such good news for European cell factories. According to P3, the prices quoted refer to cells imported from China, including all export costs and the mandatory battery passport. These batteries are more than 20% cheaper than cells manufactured in Europe, regardless of whether the production site is operated by a Chinese or a European company. P3 expects demand from batteries to increase from around 0.3 TWh per year today to roughly 1.6 TWh by 2035 — a fivefold increase. Approximately 70% of batteries will be devoted to powering electric vehicles, and 10% commercial vehicles, and the remainder to grid and home storage. Schwartzer notes that as Volkswagen designs itssmall ID.1 modelstarting at €20,000, the cost of the battery will be a prime consideration. The company may decide to offer the car with a 30 kWh battery to meet its price target, with larger batteries available at higher price points. The basic car would meet the needs of drivers who need a car for commuting or driving to the local grocery store, while the higher priced models would suit the needs of those who regularly drive longer distances. Increasing the battery size to 55 kWh would increase the cost of the battery to the manufacturer by €1,250, but the additional range might mean buyers would be willing to spend an extra €3,000 to €4,000, which would go a long way toward making the car profitable for the manufacturer — Volkswagen, in the case of the ID.1. The automotive industry is now making money on every electric car sold, Schwartzer claims.CleanTechnicareaders, who know a thing or two about the EV revolution, may choose not to accept his assertion at face value, but the question remains whether the margins for electric cars are as high as they are for infernal combustion cars. Volkswagen intends to achieve the same profit margins with its MEB Small platform as with its comparable combustion engine vehicles, which means the margins on the VW ID.2 and ID.2X are expected to match those of the Polo and T-Cross. Schwartzer speculates that with smart marketing, the margins on premium EV models — those with dual motors, larger batteries, and longer range — may actually exceed those on comparable gas-powered models. The jury is still out on that subject. To buttress his argument, he points out that a premium conventional car today “comes with mechanical all-wheel drive, an automatic gearbox with eight or more speeds, a combustion engine with numerous cylinders and variable valve timing, turbochargers and/or superchargers, plus a multi-stage exhaust after-treatment system that in diesel models even requires an additional tank. A comparably powerful electric drive system is far simpler — and consequently likely to be more profitable.” Assuming battery prices continue to decline, that is. “Sadly, parts of the automotive industry still indulge in self-pity over supposedly low EV profitability. This is an attitude that should be reconsidered,” he writes. The higher costs for battery cells produced in Europe — even when they come from CATL or BYD — cement China’s dominance, Schwartzer notes. “This has already led to strategic dependence. What happens if the Chinese government decides to invade Taiwan? As a countermeasure, the automotive industry is still called upon to diversify supply chains. Canada, for example, has a lot of potential. “Nevertheless, the realization remains — it is not that battery cell prices might one day fall significantly. That has already happened and will continue. Prices can fluctuate up or down in the short term, but that changes little in the big picture. Combustion engine cars, on the other hand, are losing competitiveness every single day.” We like how Schwartzer thinks. He is a true hero of the EV revolution! Dan Allard sent me a link last week to a story inUndecided,an online publication whose tag line is “Exploring how technology impacts our lives.” I am not familiar with this publication, so I am a little skeptical about its authenticity or accuracy. Nevertheless, the story says CATL is now claiming its sodium ion batteries — called Naxtra — will eventually cost as little as $10 per kWh. Not only that, the company says they will operate just fine in temperatures as low as -40º C to 70º C ( -40º F to 158º F). But wait, there’s more! CATL goes on to say itssodium ion batterieswill have a useful service life of 10,000 charge/discharge cycles. Whoa, are you sitting down?Ifall those claims turn out to be accurate, kiss your fossil fuel lifestyle goodbye! Writing inUndecided, Marr Ferrelll says, “if Naxtra really delivers 10,000 cycles, we’re talking about something like 3.6 million miles of theoretical driving before dropping below 85% capacity. That’s not a car battery anymore. That’s infrastructure. Performance-wise, Naxtra gets surprisingly close to current lithium technology.” “According to theSouth China Morning Post, Naxtra achieves an energy density of 175 Wh/kg — remarkably close to the 185 Wh/kg of average EV lithium iron phosphate batteries. Yes, it’s still behind premium nickel-based lithium batteries that hit 250-300 Wh/kg, but it’s competitive with the LFP batteries that already power millions of vehicles. CATL says this translates to a 500 kilometer (310 mile) driving range on a single charge, which covers the vast majority of daily driving needs, especially for urban and suburban use cases where most EVs spend their time.” Did you see that part about batteries becoming infrastructure? That’s exciting news. The cheaper batteries get, the more they will kick fossil fuels and nuclear to the curb. Pumped hydro and bio-fuels too. We will finally be able to decarbonize the transportation and energy generation and start disrupting other sectors of the economy and there will be nothing the know-nothings in Washington will be able to do about it. We caution readers that the claim of $10 per kWhsodium batteriesis still just over the next hill. We will be following developments and share them with you as soon as they become available, but we confess to being a little bit exited about putting all the horrendous pollution that comes from extracting, refining, andburning fossil fuelsbehind us.

I bought a 2012 Nissan LEAF on December 1st, 2011 (after putting down a $99 deposit about a year earlier). That was the first day Nissan sold LEAFs in Florida. I paid about $40,000, since I bought the model with some of the fancier features, like GPS. The fancier features didn’t end up being very good, but I loved the car. I had instant torque and was fast from zero to 30 miles an hour (not exceptional after that). The handling was precise and it was easy to park. Of course, the 70-mile range and the lack of charging stations in Florida in 2011 were huge issues, but I had three other cars and if I planned to go more than 50 miles or so, I would just take a different car for the day. I owned the car for 7 years. At the end of that time, there were more chargers, so I would sometimes charge it in the middle of running errands, but I never took the car outside the Tampa Bay area. It would have been drive an hour, charge an hour, drive an hour charge an hour. Way too much hassle for me. And that is if I found a working fast charger. If I had to use a slow charger, I would be stuck for many hours charging. Since then, I’ve owned a 2018 Tesla Model 3 Long Range RWD and a 2020 Tesla Model Y Long Range AWD (which I still own). I treat those the same as a gas car. I just drive where I want and take a few minutes to relax at the Supercharger. The lack of maintenance and repairs has been one of my favorite features of electric cars. Thisarticle from 6 years ago documents the ~$36,000 in maintenance and repair costs of my gas cars over 15 years. Compared to the ~$2,000 I’ve spent in the last 5 years (I do drive a lot less now, so not a fair comparison), it is a huge reduction and most of the $2,000 is a set of tires. The reason I wrote this article is to highlight the progress the industry has made in the last 15 years, not to promote this car in particular. I do think Nissan did a great job of addressing the many faults of the previous LEAF, andKyle Field will be publishing an article soon on his driving impressions of the new LEAF! Here are the enhancements comparing the 2026 LEAF to the 2011 LEAF (which was very similar to the 2012 LEAF I owned): The ones that stand out to me are about 4 times the range, active thermal management (my LEAF needed a new battery after a few years in the Florida heat, as did most owners’), faster charging using the NACS standard instead of reliance on hard-to-find CHAdeMO stations, Vehicle to Load (V2L) capability (although, I think the LEAF has had that for years), up to twice the power, advanced driver assistance, and MUCH better interior and exterior styling. Note: Prices are base manufacturer’s suggested retail prices (MSRP) excluding destination fees, taxes, and other charges. Adjusted prices are in 2025 dollars, using US CPI-U annual averages (estimated for 2025 and 2026 based on forecasts). For 2026, models are not fully released yet, so values are projected. EPA combined MPG for the cheapest car is for the base model. Nissan LEAF range is for the base model EPA-estimated range. What stands out is that the inflation-adjusted price of the cheapest car you can buy in the US has gone up 36% and isn’t a lot better (except maybe a little safer).

The EV charging management firm ev.energy has just released a new study showing that next-level charging programs could yield $30 billion in savings on utility costs in the US, which works out to a much-welcome cut of about 10% per ratepayer by 2035 whether they own an EV or not. That’s nice, except the people in charge of federal energy policy at the present time are determined to stomp the EV movement into ground. Still, hope springs eternal, so let’s take a look at that new report It costs money to charge up an EV, but ev.energy is among those pointing out that, unlike gasmobiles, EVs sport large batteries that can interact with the local grid. From that perspective, EVs are a community-wide energy storage asset that can be charged and discharged strategically to helpprevent power disruptionsandimprove grid reliabilityfor everyone, while enabling utilities to reduce the expense of grid upgrades for everyone. The new report was released today under the self explanatory title,The Utility Playbook for Turning EV Grid Risk intoa $30 Billion Opportunity,with ev.energy joined by research partner The Brattle Group. “Uniquely, EVs provide significant levels of energy flexibility, saving utilities on costly, premature upgrades,” ev.energy emphasized in a press statement. “Each actively managed EV can save utilities an average of between $145-$575 per year for every customer enrolled,” they added. “Adding bidirectional charging, or vehicle-to-grid, more than doubles these benefits, providing an annual avoided cost exceeding $1,300 per vehicle,” they added again for good measure. Critics are fond of characterizing EVs as expensive playthings for the elite, but then again, so are conventional cars.Transportationis the second-highest single household expense, and owng a vehicle is a particular squeeze for lower-income households. A 2023 report from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics sheds some light on the subject. “In 2022, households with income lower than $25,000 who owned at least one vehicle spent 38% of their after-tax income on transportation; while households with the same income who did not own or lease a vehicle spent 5% of their after-tax income on transportation,” BTS noted. The agency also observed that the car-no car difference held steady across income groups. Of course, many more lower-income households would benefit if many more mass transportation options were available across the board, which will not happen any time in the foreseeable future. In the US, that’s too far of a policy river to climb. The alternative is to make car ownership more affordable, and EVs offer an opportunity to get that done. Alongside the fallingcost of EV batteries, auto industry analysts note that the long term savings on fuel and maintenance can favor an EV over its traditional counterparts on a TCO (total cost of ownership) basis. Smart EV charging programs can provide EV owners with a unique opportunity for additional savings. The new ev.charging report affirms previous studies that draw attention to the state of modern grid technology in general and the virtual power plant movement in particular, in which many thousands of widely disbursed energy users are precisely coordinated to achieve the greater goals of the local grid. “Past analyses have shown that Virtual Power Plants can deliver reliable power at costs up to 60% lower than traditional generators,” noted Ryan Hledik, a Principal at The Brattle Group. Hledik also emphasized that the report affirms the flexibility of EV charging as a significant new tool for utilities to improve affordability as well as reliability. Considering that more than 90% of US households own at least one vehicle, the payoff from managed EV charging will grow alongside EV adoption. “Managed charging offers a superior route to deliver maximum savings for drivers and utilities, while meeting growing energy demand and supporting grid optimization,” ev.energy explains. To be clear, ev.energy’s vision of managed EV charging is not the same as the familiar Time-of-Use incentives. Discounted ToU rates motivate EV drivers to charge up at off-peak hours. That works for now, but as EV adoption expands the concern is that a secondary peak will develop. The new report makes the case for a more sophisticated approach by stackingsix areas of savingsmade possible through managed EV charging and vehicle-to-grid technology, based partly on the findings from ev.energy’s three dozen managed charging programs in the US and Canada. In California, for example, a pilot managed charging project achieved 98% off-peak energy use, compared to the rate of just 60-70% achieved by Time of Use discounts. Meanwhile, a case study in Indiana revealed that savings can be realized even with just 5% EV adoption in a utility’s service territory. As calculated by ev.energy, more than 800 utilities in the US have already passed the 5% EV adoption tipping point. That figure could climb a bit as the fallout from the premature demise of the $7,500 EV tax credit sinks in and car buyers rush to take advantage before it expires on September 30. And, rush they are.EV sales in the USincreased at the unimpressive rate of 6% as of July of this year compared to 2024, but a sudden spurt of interest emerged between June and July, after the Republican majority in Congress eliminated the tax credit in their new “OBBA” tax bill. “Electric vehicle (EV) salesspiked 26.4% last month as consumers rushed to buy cars before the federal government’s $7,500 EV tax credit expires this fall,” Kelley Blue Book reported on August 19, citing data from Cox Automotive. The $4,000 credit for used EVs will also expire on September 30, leading to a 23.2% jump in sales for July over June as tracked by Cox. As for the long term outlook for EV adoption, after Congress passed the new tax bill both Ford and General Motors went out of their way to announce ambitious new billion-dollar plans to introducemore affordable EVsinto the US market, partly based on the low cost ofLFP (lithium-iron-phosphate) battery technology. The furious pace ofthe public charging station buildoutin the US is also lends support to the post-tax credit outlook, with high-profile roadside convenience stores like Royal Farms and fast food chains like Waffle House among many others lending their familiar brand names to the vehicle electrification movement. That’s all well and good, but without support from federal policy makers the EV transition will continue to underperform in the US, and households will have to wait for some much-needed relief from high transportation costs and utility bills. If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Better yet,find your representativesin Congress and let them know what you think.

The question is whether or not sales will drop off a cliff following the untimely death of the $7,500 credit. For an answer, take a look at the EV charging plans under way at the popular convenience store chain Royal Farms. Are they crazy to install new charging stations just when the EV movement is about to head south, or do they know something…? Convenience store operators like Royal Farms do know something about EVs. Electric cars take more time to refuel than a conventional car, leaving drivers with more time on their hands to wander around in a store and buy more things, necessary or not. In addition, EV drivers don’t have to tend a pump hands-on. They can hook up and go forth in search of coffee, chips, and name-embossed key chains while their car does all the work. In addition, today’s convenience store operators don’t necessarily have to lay cash in the barrel to get their hands on a new charging station. Players in the burgeoning CaaS (Charging-as-a-Service) industry are more than happy to take up the burden of permits, planning, electrical work, equipment acquisition, installation, and operation for a cut of the charging revenue. Royal Farms is a case in point. As of January, the company had 76 charging ports up and running at 23 of its locations in Maryland and Delaware, under a CaaS agreement with Blink Energy. Despite the abrupt shift in federal electrification policy since January, Royal Farms keeps adding more stations. Last weekElectrify Americaannounced that will install its “Hyper-Fast” charging stations at eight Royal Farms locations in Maryland, for a total of 55 charging ports. EV critics have made much hay over the purported inconvenience of EV charging on the road. That was a reasonably legit argument back in the olden days, when charging times were slow and public chargers were few and far between — and frequently out of order, too. However, 2025 would like a word. Charging times and reliability have both improved, route planning apps make it easier to find a working station, and public stations have proliferated. Meanwhile, the retail gas industry has been steadily consolidating into fewer locations. As may be expected, Electrify America enthusiastically endorses the idea that EV charging is part and parcel of the convenience store experience. “By combining speed and convenience, we’re helping make the EV experience more effortless, whether you’re on a daily commute or taking a longer road trip,” Electrify VP of operations Anthony Lambkin said in a press statement announcing the new charging stations. Royal Farms also chipped in its two cents. At a time when federal policy makers have pushed environmental concerns to the back burner, it’s notable that the company took the opportunity to connect EVs with forward momentum. “These new stations make it easier for drivers to choose electric without sacrificing speed or comfort, while reinforcing our commitment to accessibility and progress,” said Thomas Ruszin, who holds the position of “fuel & environmental leader” at Royal Farms. Ruszin also drew attention to the complementary relationship between EV charging and convenience stores. “Our partnership with Electrify America brings high-speed EV charging to the locations our customers already visit for fuel, food, and convenience,” he said. For the record, by high-speed Ruszin means Electrify’s 20-minute “Hyper-Fast” charging time. That’s nowhere near the 5-minute charge envisioned by other industry leaders, but it dovetails neatly with the food-plus-fuel (plus restrooms) business model. So, is Royal Farms dreaming? Do they really expect to attract significantly more traffic from drivers in search of a charge after the tax credit expires? That remains to be seen. However, Royal Farms is far from the only gas retailer to recognize that it can suck more value out of its existing real estate by installing EV chargers, especially where high-traffic locations are involved. In recent months, for example,Circle K,Love’s, and newcomerApplegreenhave also joined their food-plus-fuel model to the nation’s public EV charging network along major highways. Meanwhile, stakeholders in the quick serve restaurant industry are also competing for a slice of driver traffic. Cracker Barrel, Denny’s, Waffle House, and BoJangles are among the high profile QSR stakeholders to launch or expand theircharging planssince the beginning of the year. The interest of the QSR industry in EV charging also underscores the advantage of EVs over gasmobiles from an investment and de-risking perspective. Today’s transportable,battery-equipped charging stationscan be dropped into practically any location where space and a grid hookup is available. For QSRs without an existing gas storage tank, that’s practically a no-brainer compared to the issues involved in installing new gas pumps, including permits and excavation in addition to a grid connection. Another advantage on the EV charging side has emerged alongside the loomingtruck driver shortage, extreme weather events, and other factors that can cause gas stations to run out of fuel. Truck drivers have also been known to drop off the wrong fuel in storage tanks, leading to engine damage for customers and a black eye for the station owner. Of course, no story about EV charging at roadside retail stores is complete without a mention of Tesla and its A-rated Supercharger network, especially now that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has indicated that his company will leverage its Superchargers, and its brand name, to expand into the QSR field. Musk first teased the idea ofa retro-themed diner-style restaurantback in 2018. After the usual on-brand delay, the first Tesla Diner finally materialized last month in Los Angeles, complete with 80 Superchargers stalls. Shortly before the high profile opening, Musk hinted at more to come on his personal social media site X (formerly Twitter). “If our retro-futuristic diner turns out well, which I think it will,@Teslawill establish these in major cities around the world, as well as atSupercharger siteson long distance routes,” Musk wrote on July 19. That’s all well and good, butstate transportation authoritiesin New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere have other ideas about who and what gets a juicy slice of the highway rest stop experience.

Schools that get their own solar power reduce their electricity costs and avoid carbon emissions. They also set an example to their students, who are the future of humanity, in two ways. First, they are reducing their reliance on fossil fuels, and secondly, they are choosing clean, renewable electricity. In particular, solar power carports make sense because they generate electricity from a free source of power, sunlight, and they provide shade in summer. They also provide some protection from rain, sleet, hail, high winds, and snow. Ridgefield High School in Ridgefield, Connecticut, just had a new solar carport installed. It was the product of a joint collaboration between Davis Hill Development and the Connecticut Green Bank.Micah Brill, Vice President of Asset Management atDavis Hill Development, answered some questions about the project. What is the solar carport’s capacity? The Ridgefield High School solar carport has a capacity of 1,038 kW (1 MW). While we don’t typically share project-specific financial details, a standard solar carport installation averages about $4 per watt. Based on that benchmark, this system represents an investment of roughly $4 million. How many jobs were created during the installation process? The project supported work for both local electrical contractors and national carport manufacturers, helping create and sustain jobs across the supply chain. According to theSolar Energy Industries Association(SEIA), the solar sector is one of the fastest-growing sources of new U.S. jobs, employing more than 260,000 workers nationwide — a trend this project directly contributes to. How long will the solar carport generate electricity, in years? The system is backed by a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Ridgefield, ensuring decades of reliable clean energy. In practice, the panels and associated equipment are designed for a useful life of over 30 years, meaning the solar carport will keep generating electricity well beyond the contract period. The project is operated by a subsidiary of Skyview Ventures, which has an asset management team responsible for ongoing operations and maintenance. What is Ridgefield’s solar leadership? Ridgefield has been a sustainability leader for nearly a decade. In addition to this new carport, the Town has installed rooftop solar across eight other schools and municipal buildings, reflecting a long-standing commitment to clean energy and fiscal responsibility. What will the solar array’s electricity be used for? The electricity will directly serve Ridgefield High School and is uniquely integrated into four separate Town- and School-owned meters. This ensures optimal on-site solar use while also participating in Connecticut incentive programs like NRES, ZRECs, and Class I RECs. How much carbon emissions will be avoided by using solar power? By using solar power, we’ll avoid an estimated 700,000 pounds of carbon emissions every year. That’s the climate equivalent of: These figures are based on the EPA’s Power Profiler and Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator, which help translate emissions reductions into tangible, everyday comparisons.

That means China added solar and wind capacity fast enough to cover new demand and then some.U.S. coal fired electricity jumped 14%in the same span. That came as natural gas prices rose by more than 60%, pushing utilities to use coal again because it was cheaper. Coal fired generation rose to the highest level since 2022 in many regions. Natural gas prices surged in early 2025 largely because U.S. supply was being pulled into global markets at a record pace. Strong demand in Europe and Asia kept liquefied natural gas cargoes sailing out of American ports, linking domestic prices more tightly to international benchmarks than ever before. That exposed U.S. consumers to the same price shocks felt abroad. At the same time, Trump’s policies removed barriers to export expansion and weakened regulations that might have reserved more supply for domestic use. By prioritizing sales overseas, the administration amplified the pressure on local markets, driving up costs for power producers at home and making coal the cheaper option to keep the lights on. China’s clean energy build out is about more than panels and wind turbines. It includes new transmission lines, storage, grid upgrades and planning that prevents waste. That kind of infrastructure shapes behaviour because once it is built, it guides investment and operation. When you string HVDC lines across vast provinces you force your economy into solar, wind and hydro. If you tie all that clean energy into storage and smart grids your room for coal shrinks. China’s record deployments of renewables in 2025 are not just expanding capacity, they are actively displacing fossil generation and the pollution that comes with it. The 92 GW of solar installed in May alone pushed total solar capacity past 1 TW, a level no other country is close to. That scale means new electricity demand can be met without firing up additional coal plants, and in many cases existing fossil units are being run less often or shut down altogether. Every gigawatt of clean generation that feeds the grid trims coal burn, lowers sulfur dioxide and particulate emissions, and cuts CO₂ output. The result is a visible reduction in air pollution across major industrial regions and a measurable decline in national emissions, showing how infrastructure choices directly reshape both climate outcomes and public health. In the United States the opposite is happening. Coal plants that should be retired are staying online. Companies that can run on coal or gas are choosing coal because gas is costly. That reinforces the case for keeping coal plants alive and for dogged holding on to the old system. Once you keep that plant alive you delay the cost signals that would push toward renewables. Every hour you burn coal that should not be burning you lock in that path a bit more. Policy choices matter. China is pushing power sector transformation through central planning. It can build clean infrastructure quickly. The United States is moving backward with executive orders that extend the life of aging coal plants, lift barriers to coal mining, and give regulatory breaks to coal operators. That opens a political door to keep care for coal instead of care for investment in cleaner alternatives. Behind the policies are economics and ideology. Solar and wind have dropped in cost for years. Batteries are cheaper. In China that means cheap renewables can compete and win. In the United States political choices tilt the scale back toward coal even if markets say otherwise. That tension between economic reality and political preference defines energy choices in 2025 more than ever before. The cost of coal never totally disappeared. When gas prices jumped to an average of about $3.53 per million Btu compared with $2.15 last year utilities switched back. That shift left coal fired output up 14% and fossil fuel generation up 1% overall in power. Clean energy output did rise 3% thanks to 34% more solar generation. But coal’s rebound erased years of progress. All of this has long term implications for emissions. U.S. power sector emissions rose sharply in early 2025, pushing global emissions up even while China cut them. China offset about 60 million tons of emissions, while the U.S. added million of tons in the first quarter alone. That gap tells a story of two systems. China’s infrastructure trajectory means its emissions path will keep tilting down, even if it keeps building a little coal capacity for backup. The system it is building makes clean power a default choice. The United States is setting up infrastructure lock in for fossil fuel generation that holds power switched toward coal. That choice weighs on long term emissions because infrastructure lives longer than policy cycles. The health and environmental consequences of coal’s trajectory in China and the United States are stark. As China cuts coal use, it reduces fine particulate pollution that drives respiratory illness, lowers sulfur dioxide emissions that cause acid rain, and trims carbon output that fuels climate change. The improvements are visible in cleaner skies and measurable drops in premature deaths linked to air pollution. In the U.S., the coal rebound reverses those gains, with more mercury, particulates, and greenhouse gases released into the air. That choice burdens public health, increases medical costs, and deepens the climate footprint, showing how infrastructure decisions echo far beyond the power sector. At some point grids make their own logic. You build capacity and operators use it. They fix it. They send more power through it. They bond with it. The more clean grid you put in the ground the harder you pull the system into cleaner choices. The more you keep old coal plants alive the more you preserve the option to use coal when problems emerge. Energy transitions are made of paths chosen and infrastructure built. You might say infrastructure is the architecture of emissions. Build one type and you get one kind of future. Build another and you get a different one. Today China is architecting a low carbon energy system. The United States is investing in a fossil fuel version. That choice matters not just for the next year but for the next decade.

It’s very much a “China model,” designed for the Chinese market since the market 1) is huge, especially for electric vehicles, and 2) has many buyers that plan to sit in the back seat of their cars and be transported around. The Model Y L starts at just around $47,000 there, but also keep in mind that EVs are generally much cheaper in China. What has disappointed many Tesla fans and shareholders is the Model Y L may never come to the USA, and the earliest it would come if it does is late 2026, according to Tesla CEO Elon Musk. (Funny enough, despite so many other issues at Tesla, this seems to have led to a drop in the stock price.) But we already publisheda good piece on the Model Y L— ortwo of them— a month ago, so let’s get to the more interesting, or at least more fun and entertaining, story. So, as you all probably know, when Tesla launched a refreshed version of the Model 3 a couple of years ago, it came without turn-signal stalks. There were buttons put on the steering wheel to activate turn signals, but the traditional stalk for this was eliminated. Naturally, since people have been driving using turn signals stalks for their whole lives, this felt very strange and unnatural, and many people wouldn’t even consider buying a car without a turn signal stalk. Elon Musk contended that no one would need turn signal stalks soon since Tesla cars would be able to drive themselves, and that it’s not hard to get used to using buttons anyway. However, people are used to their stalks and want their stalks. You can also tell people that they can put ice cream on bread or rice cakes and eat it like that, but people are used to ice cream cones and that’s what they want. Musk was very stubborn about this every time it came up, but apparently customers can be even more stubborn — or at least annoying. Or perhaps Tesla just has enough of a consumer demand issue that it’ll do more and more things to try to appeal to buyers. (Also, keep in mind that Tesla customer cars still can’t drive themselves unsupervised.) Whatever the reason, you can now/again get a turn signal stalk on retrofitted onto your Tesla Model 3 if you bought a model without one. There are just two conditions. First of all, you have to be buying the car in China. (For now, at least, this is only an option in China.) Secondly, you’ve got to pay extra for it. Yes, if you want a turn signal stalk on your car, you have to pay extra for it. Don’t laugh. It costs RMB 2,499 (~$350). New versions of the Model 3 — all versions — again come with the turn signal stalk by default. So, at least it’s not an add-on on a new vehicle. It may just be that the Chinese government is now requiring this basic instrument. Perhaps it’s not a consumer demand issue at all. Either way, though, the important point is that you no longer have to worry (in China) about your Model 3 not coming with a turn signal stalk. The Model Y, by the way, has come with a turn signal stalk the whole time. The refreshed version of the Model Y didn’t eliminate the stalk.

With the International Maritime Organization eyeing a 50% emissions cut by 2050, we’re going to need legit zero-emission technology to hit those targets.VINSSENandMarinteknikshook hands on an MOU in Singapore that could upend the status quo. They’re rolling out ahydrogen-ready battery-based hybrid propulsion system—a plug-and-play solution you start out running as a diesel-hybrid and then seamlessly flip to fullhydrogen fuel cellsor battery-electric power when the ports are set up for green hydrogen bunkering. Of course, building it is one thing; proving it commercially at sea is a whole other ballgame.Turning the Tide in Maritime DecarbonizationThe MOU brings togetherVINSSEN—the South Korean crew behind Korea’s first AIP-certified hydrogen vessel and a type-approved 60 kW PEM fuel cell stack—andMarinteknik, Singapore’s trusted partner for vessel design and turnkey projects for over four decades. They’re pitching a super-modular setup: interchangeable fuel cell and battery pods, smart digital control units and a diesel genset as a backup. Captains can dip their toes in with diesel-hybrid mode, nail down performance on shorter routes, then plug in zero-emission modules as the hydrogen infrastructure evolves—no major engine-room remodel required.Inside the Hybrid PowertrainAt its heart, the system blends three power sources: diesel gensets, battery banks andhydrogen fuel cells. VINSSEN’s cloud-based vessel management platform keeps an eye on power demands, route data and safety stats in real time. It juggles load between diesel and batteries to optimize cost and emissions, then flips to hydrogen cells for silent, zero-emission cruising when ports are ready to refuel with clean energy. Those AIP-certified 60 kW PEM modules hit peak efficiencies of up to 55% and pass all the marine vibration tests. Batteries handle peak loads, slashing genset time by about 40% in trials. And because everything comes in ISO container-sized skids, swapping modules during port calls is literally a plug-and-play job. Safety’s covered too: double-walled hydrogen tanks, fail-safe valves and next-gen leak detection wired into the digital brain—just what regulators want to see.Playing the Long GameThis partnership isn’t just about hardware—it’s a strategic chess move.VINSSENlocks into Southeast Asia’s booming shipping scene, riding on Marinteknik’s deep ties with shipowners and regulators. Marinteknik, meanwhile, fast-tracks its foray into hydrogen propulsion without investing a fortune in R&D. Their rollout plan is smart: kick off with tugs and ferries, then scale up to offshore support vessels and smaller cargo ships. Each successful pilot builds confidence, nudging leasing companies and insurers to warm up to hydrogen’s risks. And with a regional push onsustainable energy, they’re betting that a 20% cut in fuel costs versus diesel-hybrids will seal early deals and set the bar for competitors.Singapore: From Bunker Fuel to Hydrogen Hub?Singapore handles more cargo than almost anywhere else—over 37 million TEUs a year—and it’s desperate to shake off heavy fuel oil’s nasty emissions. LNG bunkering’s already live, methanol trials are wrapping up, and electric ferries are on the water. Under the Maritime Green Plan 2030, the city-state wants green corridors linking it to Australia and Japan, aiming to slice up to 10 million tonnes of CO₂ in the next decade. The Maritime and Port Authority is dangling grants covering up to 30% of green tech capex, and the Economic Development Board is lining up anchor tenants for hydrogen bunkers. Hosting VINSSEN-Marinteknik pilots cements Singapore as a test-bed: ports fine-tune bunkering protocols, crews get honed on hydrogen-handling, and regulators draft real-world safety rules. Nail a 30% emissions cut with solid uptime, and this local MOU could become the blueprint for Jakarta, Shanghai or even Dubai.The Real-World HurdlesDon’t kid yourself—it’s not going to be smooth sailing. Green hydrogen production in Asia is still in its infancy, with electrolysis capacity clustered in a handful of mega-projects, so supply remains patchy. Building a pan-Asian network of high-pressure hydrogen bunkering stations will demand billions inhydrogen infrastructureinvestments and policy stability that outlasts election cycles. Onboard, those beefy tanks and safety systems eat into cargo space, and crews need rock-solid training; a leak demands split-second action. Regulators must sync up standards on bunkering, storage and emergency response across multiple jurisdictions—a legal and logistical maze. Cost is another pinch point: retrofitting hybrids with hydrogen gear runs 20–30% higher than diesel-hybrids. Operators will only take the plunge if carbon levies, subsidies or long-term fuel savings tip the scales. Untilhydrogen fuel cellsstack up on price, we could see adoption stall after a few flashy demos. Insurers are still guessing on hydrogen conversions too—steep premiums could push financing costs sky-high unless governments step in with guarantees.Looking Over the HorizonLet’s be real: this MOU isn’t going to sink fossil-fuel shipping overnight, but it’s a crucial pilot for unlockingzero-emission technologyat sea. IfVINSSENandMarinteknikcan prove they can deliver reliable, cost-effective service on Singapore’s busiest lanes, hydrogen might finally move from lab bench to mainstream shipping fuel. The trick? Ports, policies and purse strings all have to line up. Keep your eyes peeled for next year’s pilot results—they’ll show whether this dream of green hydrogen-powered shipping is set to become the new normal.Spread the love Turning the Tide in Maritime DecarbonizationThe MOU brings togetherVINSSEN—the South Korean crew behind Korea’s first AIP-certified hydrogen vessel and a type-approved 60 kW PEM fuel cell stack—andMarinteknik, Singapore’s trusted partner for vessel design and turnkey projects for over four decades.

Operators will only take the plunge if carbon levies, subsidies or long-term fuel savings tip the scales. Untilhydrogen fuel cellsstack up on price, we could see adoption stall after a few flashy demos. Insurers are still guessing on hydrogen conversions too—steep premiums could push financing costs sky-high unless governments step in with guarantees. Looking Over the HorizonLet’s be real: this MOU isn’t going to sink fossil-fuel shipping overnight, but it’s a crucial pilot for unlockingzero-emission technologyat sea. IfVINSSENandMarinteknikcan prove they can deliver reliable, cost-effective service on Singapore’s busiest lanes, hydrogen might finally move from lab bench to mainstream shipping fuel. The trick? Ports, policies and purse strings all have to line up. Keep your eyes peeled for next year’s pilot results—they’ll show whether this dream of green hydrogen-powered shipping is set to become the new normal.Spread the love Let’s be real: this MOU isn’t going to sink fossil-fuel shipping overnight, but it’s a crucial pilot for unlockingzero-emission technologyat sea.

Picture an ice-blue giant—90 feet tall, 83 feet across—cradling hundreds of thousands of gallons of rocket fuel for theNASA ArtemisMoon missions. It’s the perfect mash-up of raw industrial power, delicate logistics and cutting-edgecryogenic fuelwizardry—and wow, it does not disappoint.Perched on Merritt Island—home to about 36,000 people and nestled inside Florida’s legendary Space Coast wildlife refuge—the Kennedy Space Center has to juggle high-tech performance with environmental care. Every new structure here needs to be a tech marvel without upsetting the local ecosystem. Enter hydrogen, the clean fuel hero.From Truckloads to Tank: The Fill in NumbersThink of the operation as a frozen ballet: heavy-duty trucks rolling in with super-cooled hydrogen, each one a vital dancer in the routine. From the portside bulk terminals to the sphere’s loading arms, over 50 massive trailers hauledliquid hydrogenat –253 °C. By wrap-up time, that colossal tank held more than 730,000 gallons—the largest single-delivery missionAir Productshas ever pulled off for NASA.Volume delivered:730,000+ gallonsTrailer loads:50+Tank size:90 ft tall, 83 ft diameterCompletion date:August 21, 2025Location:Kennedy Space Center, Merritt IslandSafety was the name of the game. The sphere’s wrapped in multi-layer insulation, plus active nitrogen-cooled jackets to fight heat creep. Pressure relief valves, liquid-level sensors and a backup nitrogen purge system keep things locked down, so engineers can focus on launching rockets instead of chasing boil-off emergencies.Lessons from History: From Apollo to ArtemisThis milestone didn’t spring up overnight. Back in the 1960s, NASA pioneeredliquid hydrogenpropulsion on the Saturn V to send Apollo crews to the Moon. AndAir Productshas been in the mix since 1957, supplying LH₂ for Mercury, Apollo and the Space Shuttle. Decades of tweaks—from insulation upgrades to smarter piping—culminate in this record-breakinghydrogen sphere.During the Shuttle era, ground teams wrestled with relentless boil-off that could push a launch back by hours—sometimes ending in costly scrubs. Thanks to ongoing improvements like automated vent systems and beefier insulation, today’s sphere slashes waste and keeps pad operations humming along smoothly.What Makes This Hydrogen Sphere a Game-Changer?It’s more than size—it’s about adaptability. With a local stockpile of ultra-coldcryogenic fuel, NASA can:Speed upNASA Artemislaunch cadence, maybe even squeeze in multiple missions each seasonEliminate supply chain chokepoints between production, transit and on-pad storagePower lunar surface activities and refill the Gateway space station with easeIn plain terms, that translates to quicker rocket stacking, more reliable fueling windows and a rock-solid base for sustained Moon exploration.Fueling Artemis and BeyondAll that storedliquid hydrogenis earmarked for the cryogenic engines of NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS), the backbone of theNASA Artemismissions bound for lunar orbit and beyond. When hydrogen meets liquid oxygen, you get jaw-dropping thrust and almost zero carbon footprint—exactly what you need to heft heavy payloads, crew capsules and landers into space. With this giant sphere on deck, NASA can be confident their core and upper stages never run short of propellant.But Artemis isn’t a one-and-done moon landing. It’s a sprawling campaign to build a cislunar gateway, support long-term stays in lunar orbit and on the surface, and set up shop for future Mars trips. Those plans hinge on reliable, repeatable fueling cycles. Having 730,000+ gallons of fuel at the ready lets engineers fine-tune pad procedures, track boil-off rates over weeks, and gather the real-world data essential for off-Earth storage—whether that’s in the Gateway module or future lunar habitats.Why Hydrogen Remains CrucialWhy pick hydrogen over other propellants? It boils down to energy efficiency: hydrogen packs an unbeatable specific impulse—over 460 seconds in vacuum—making it the top choice for deep-space kick. And its only exhaust is nearly pure water vapor, which ticks the boxes for both Earth’s climate goals and lunar environmental safeguards.Spillover Effects on Clean EnergyThishydrogen sphereis more than a space-age showpiece—it’s a live demo in mega-scaleliquid hydrogen storagelogistics that could reshape industries back home. Lessons in cryogenic handling, rigorous safety protocols and just-in-time delivery are directly shaping green hydrogen projects on Earth. As investors and policymakers watch these high-volume LH₂ operations succeed, confidence builds for deploying hydrogen in heavy industry, grid storage and zero-emission transport—turbocharging the global clean energy shift.And the local impact is real: dozens of specialized roles—from cryogenic engineers to heavy transport drivers—got a boost, cementing the Space Coast’s rep as an aerospace innovation hot spot and hub for high-tech jobs.Scaling Up Lunar Fuel InfrastructurePicture fuel depots not on Merritt Island, but in lunar orbit or parked on the Moon itself. The same rules—managing boil-off, keeping insulation intact and monitoring pressure—apply off-Earth.

This project lays the groundwork for a sustainable, high-tempo exploration future.Looking Ahead: The Next Giant LeapNow that the world’s largesthydrogen sphereis up and running, theNASA Artemisprogram is firing on all cylinders. Launches will be more predictable, missions more dependable. AndAir Productsisn’t just flexing its muscles in Florida—their global portfolio of mega-scale hydrogen projects, from Europe to the Middle East, feeds straight into NASA’s playbook for international, commercial partnerships on Artemis and future trips to Mars.Down here on Earth, it’s a reminder that human ingenuity is pushing the next frontier faster than ever.

It’s a bold step towards transforming a region once chained to coal into a shining example ofhydrogen infrastructureandindustrial decarbonization.Coal Byproducts Fuel a New EraOn August 18, 2025, the two inked a strategic cooperation agreement to supercharge R&D and roll outfuel cell technologyacross Lüliang in Shanxi Province. They’re not just talking – the program kicks off with 100 heavy-dutyhydrogen fuel cell trucksand 250 logistics vehicles, hauling raw materials for coking plants and serving urban cold-chain routes.Lüliang’s history is pretty straightforward: coal mining and coke ovens have ruled the roost, churning out a staggering 4.4 billion cubic meters of coke oven gas each year. Lucky for them, that byproduct is a goldmine: operators can tease out around 200,000 tonnes ofhydrogen productionannually—enough juice to keep a whole fleet of zero-emission trucks buzzing. The vision? Turn Shanxi’s industrial heartland into a realhydrogen productionpowerhouse.From Lab to HighwaysFounded in 2012,SinoHytechas been the quiet force behind cutting-edge R&D and the industrial rollout ofhydrogen fuel cellsengine systems for heavy transport. On the flip side,Pengfei Grouphandles everything fromhydrogen productionand storage to refueling and real-world application—not to mention managing a 70,000-strong heavy truck fleet. By pairing SinoHytec’s core fuel cell stacks with Pengfei’s refueling network and digital logistics know-how, they’re basically offering a one-stop shop for fleet operators.Why This Partnership MattersWith China gunning for carbon neutrality by 2060, greening its traditional energy hubs is top of the agenda. This team-up ticks every box: speeding up the commercialization ofhydrogen fuel cells, giving a leg-up to the coal region’s economy, and laying down a blueprint for reproduciblehydrogen infrastructurenetworks across the country. Policymakers are already eyeing it as a go-to model for large-scale rollouts.Opportunities and HurdlesOn the upside, they’re creating a full-circle supply chain—from turning coke oven gas into clean fuel to hitting the road with hydrogen-powered rigs. It’s a big win for opening new markets, slashing tailpipe emissions, and generating local jobs in tech, construction, and operations.But let’s be real: switching tohydrogen fuel cellsisn’t simply buying new trucks and calling it a day. Those zero-emission rigs still come with steeper price tags compared to diesel. Then factor in the headache of building rock-solid refueling stations, stress-testing every component under nonstop heavy-duty cycles, and blending the new fleet into existing supply chains.

Hit the mark on those first 350 vehicles, and you’ll likely see new hydrogen clusters popping up from Inner Mongolia to Guangdong. Plus, as production scales and prices keep sliding, the total cost of ownership should inch closer to diesel, lighting a fire under fleet operators to make the switch.About the CompaniesSinoHytec(founded 2012) specializes in R&D and the industrialization of hydrogen fuel cell engine systems for heavy-duty transport.Pengfei Groupoversees the fullhydrogen infrastructurechain—production, storage, transport, refueling, and applications—and operates one of China’s largest heavy truck fleets.Spread the love On August 18, 2025, the two inked a strategic cooperation agreement to supercharge R&D and roll outfuel cell technologyacross Lüliang in Shanxi Province. They’re not just talking – the program kicks off with 100 heavy-dutyhydrogen fuel cell trucksand 250 logistics vehicles, hauling raw materials for coking plants and serving urban cold-chain routes. Lüliang’s history is pretty straightforward: coal mining and coke ovens have ruled the roost, churning out a staggering 4.4 billion cubic meters of coke oven gas each year. Lucky for them, that byproduct is a goldmine: operators can tease out around 200,000 tonnes ofhydrogen productionannually—enough juice to keep a whole fleet of zero-emission trucks buzzing. The vision? Turn Shanxi’s industrial heartland into a realhydrogen productionpowerhouse.From Lab to HighwaysFounded in 2012,SinoHytechas been the quiet force behind cutting-edge R&D and the industrial rollout ofhydrogen fuel cellsengine systems for heavy transport. On the flip side,Pengfei Grouphandles everything fromhydrogen productionand storage to refueling and real-world application—not to mention managing a 70,000-strong heavy truck fleet. By pairing SinoHytec’s core fuel cell stacks with Pengfei’s refueling network and digital logistics know-how, they’re basically offering a one-stop shop for fleet operators.Why This Partnership MattersWith China gunning for carbon neutrality by 2060, greening its traditional energy hubs is top of the agenda. This team-up ticks every box: speeding up the commercialization ofhydrogen fuel cells, giving a leg-up to the coal region’s economy, and laying down a blueprint for reproduciblehydrogen infrastructurenetworks across the country. Policymakers are already eyeing it as a go-to model for large-scale rollouts.Opportunities and HurdlesOn the upside, they’re creating a full-circle supply chain—from turning coke oven gas into clean fuel to hitting the road with hydrogen-powered rigs. It’s a big win for opening new markets, slashing tailpipe emissions, and generating local jobs in tech, construction, and operations.But let’s be real: switching tohydrogen fuel cellsisn’t simply buying new trucks and calling it a day. Those zero-emission rigs still come with steeper price tags compared to diesel. Then factor in the headache of building rock-solid refueling stations, stress-testing every component under nonstop heavy-duty cycles, and blending the new fleet into existing supply chains. It’s a serious uphill climb.Looking AheadThis joint venture isn’t just a regional experiment—it’s the North Star guiding China’s push toward cleaner transport.

It sounds like sci-fi, right? Well, that moment is inching closer. On August 21, 2025,Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc.—the trailblazer inhigh-temperature proton exchange membrane (HT-PEM)innovation—teamed up with a leading U.S.-based global semiconductor and wireless technology player. Their goal? Co-develop and test next-genelectrochemical gas sensorsbuilt around Advent’s exclusiveIon Pair membrane.Why This Partnership mattersThis collaboration isn’t just about beefing upfuel cell technologyfor big power stations. Instead, it’s about shrinking that tech down into pocket-sized sensors for air quality checks, food-safety scans, and even non-invasive medical diagnostics—imagine bedside screening for biomarkers or breath-based early cancer detection. And we’re not talking bulky lab gear. These sensors could slot right intoportable electronicslike smartphones, wearables, or smart-home gadgets.Getting to Know the Ion Pair MembraneAt the heart of this project is Advent’s HT-PEMIon Pair membrane, originally cooked up atLos Alamos National Laboratory. Here’s what makes it tick:High-Temperature Stability:Keeps its cool (or heat) at elevated temperatures, boosting sensitivity and warding off contamination.Mechanical Robustness:Handles the stresses of microfabrication like a champ, paving the way for wafer-scale integration.Proton Conductivity:Powers precise electrochemical reactions, turning gas concentrations into clear electrical signals.In practice, trace gases—whether from air, breath, or food aromas—interact with tiny catalyst sites in the membrane. Protons zip through the structure, generating a current that directly corresponds to gas levels. It’s essentially the same principle behindhydrogen fuel cells, just miniaturized to detect parts-per-billion of target molecules.The Market Is Ripe for Tiny PowerhousesWe’re living in an era where remote monitoring, telemedicine, and the Internet of Things are converging. Demand for compact, low-power sensors is skyrocketing across industries. In an industrial setting, they’ll be vital for leak detection inhydrogen infrastructure—critical as pipelines and refueling stations lean on real-time safety monitoring. Meanwhile, restaurants, breweries, and food distributors need on-site gas analysis to keep products fresh. And consumers? They’re craving smarter air-quality tracking, whether they’re at home or on the move.How This Stacks Up Against Other SensorsSure, metal oxide semiconductor and MEMS-based sensors have made strides, but they often demand high operating temperatures or struggle with specificity. Advent’s Ion Pair HT-PEM approach offers a sweet spot: pinpoint selectivity at moderate power levels, plus a direct electronic readout that jives perfectly with digital electronics.Impact on Society and the EnvironmentEmbedding accurate gas sensors into everyday devices democratizes environmental monitoring. Imagine crowdsourced air-quality maps updated in real time by the phones in people’s pockets—no more wondering if that smog alert really applies to your street. Restaurants could scan spoilage gases at the pallet before it even reaches the shelves, slashing waste. Hospitals could breeze through breath-marker screenings for early disease detection, easing the load on lab facilities and cutting costs.Business and Strategy MovesWhat’s in it for the two partners? For Advent, it’s about broadening its patent fortress—around 150 issued or pending patents—and tapping into global semiconductor know-how. For the unnamed tech giant, it’s a chance to weave advancedsensor miniaturizationinto its chip roadmap, fast-tracking its entry into healthtech and environmental-monitoring markets.Both parties stand to gain from:Market Expansion:From city-wide air-monitoring networks to food-processing plants hungry for precise gas profiling.Healthtech Innovation:Telemedicine and point-of-care diagnostics are crying out for non-invasive, cost-effective screening tools.Consumer Electronics:Smartwatches, earbuds, and phones could boast a brand-new feature—molecular sensing on the go.Plus, this partnership could open licensing doors, as other device makers prefer adopting proven membrane materials rather than building them from scratch.Sizing Up the CompetitionBig names likeBoschandSonyhave rolled out MEMS-based gas sensors, but they often juggle power consumption and specificity. Advent’s Ion Pair platform could hit a unique sweet spot with robust performance at moderate temperatures, stellar selectivity, and seamless integration with the partner’s advanced wireless modules. Nail the cost curve, and these tiny sensors could shake up a market long dominated by bulky, less flexible modules.Livermore: Where Science Meets Startup VibeAdvent’s HQ inLivermore, California, sits smack in the innovation corridor that gave us Lawrence Livermore National Lab. With about 87,000 residents and a per-capita rent of $2,324, Livermore has transformed from a science outpost into a buzzing hub where material science collides with microelectronics and startup energy.Overcoming the Hurdles AheadMiniaturizing cutting-edge tech is never a cakewalk. The teams will need to:Prove long-term durability under repeated cyclingStamp out cross-sensitivity between different gasesMerge the membranes with existing chip-fabrication workflowsPerfect device packaging and power management to hit consumer-price targets in the cutthroat smartphone marketLooking Out to the HorizonIn the coming months, lab tests will put the Ion Pair sensors through their paces—checking sensitivity, selectivity, and endurance. If all goes well, prototype devices could pop up by late 2026, with small-batch production kicking off in 2027 and a full-blown commercial rollout by 2028. Beyond smartphones, these membranes might find homes in industrial automation systems, drone-based environmental mapping services, or futuristic fitness wearables that track metabolic biomarkers during workouts.It’s a clear sign that decades of R&D inhydrogen fuel cellsaren’t just confined to vehicles. Membranes, catalysts, and stack designs fine-tuned for heavy-duty transport are now getting a second wind in sensor tech. That kind of cross-pollination is exactly what sparks major leaps in innovation.Ultimately, this pact underscores a broader shift: as we build outsustainable energysystems and push forindustrial decarbonization, supporting technologies like gas sensors become indispensable. They ensure safety inhydrogen infrastructure, boost public health through better air-quality monitoring, and open doors to new consumer experiences that weave zero-emission tech into everyday life.The Catalystwill be keeping a close eye on how these micro-sensors evolve—from Livermore lab benches to the devices in your pocket—and what breakthroughs lie around the corner.About Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc.Headquartered in the U.S. with major operations in Greece, Advent sits at the cutting edge ofHT-PEM fuel cell technology, backed by about 150 patents.

Membranes, catalysts, and stack designs fine-tuned for heavy-duty transport are now getting a second wind in sensor tech. That kind of cross-pollination is exactly what sparks major leaps in innovation.Ultimately, this pact underscores a broader shift: as we build outsustainable energysystems and push forindustrial decarbonization, supporting technologies like gas sensors become indispensable. They ensure safety inhydrogen infrastructure, boost public health through better air-quality monitoring, and open doors to new consumer experiences that weave zero-emission tech into everyday life.The Catalystwill be keeping a close eye on how these micro-sensors evolve—from Livermore lab benches to the devices in your pocket—and what breakthroughs lie around the corner.About Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc.Headquartered in the U.S. with major operations in Greece, Advent sits at the cutting edge ofHT-PEM fuel cell technology, backed by about 150 patents. Born out of Los Alamos National Laboratory, the company trades on NASDAQ under the ticker ADN.Spread the love High-Temperature Stability:Keeps its cool (or heat) at elevated temperatures, boosting sensitivity and warding off contamination.Mechanical Robustness:Handles the stresses of microfabrication like a champ, paving the way for wafer-scale integration.Proton Conductivity:Powers precise electrochemical reactions, turning gas concentrations into clear electrical signals.In practice, trace gases—whether from air, breath, or food aromas—interact with tiny catalyst sites in the membrane. Protons zip through the structure, generating a current that directly corresponds to gas levels. It’s essentially the same principle behindhydrogen fuel cells, just miniaturized to detect parts-per-billion of target molecules.The Market Is Ripe for Tiny PowerhousesWe’re living in an era where remote monitoring, telemedicine, and the Internet of Things are converging. Demand for compact, low-power sensors is skyrocketing across industries. In an industrial setting, they’ll be vital for leak detection inhydrogen infrastructure—critical as pipelines and refueling stations lean on real-time safety monitoring. Meanwhile, restaurants, breweries, and food distributors need on-site gas analysis to keep products fresh. And consumers? They’re craving smarter air-quality tracking, whether they’re at home or on the move.How This Stacks Up Against Other SensorsSure, metal oxide semiconductor and MEMS-based sensors have made strides, but they often demand high operating temperatures or struggle with specificity. Advent’s Ion Pair HT-PEM approach offers a sweet spot: pinpoint selectivity at moderate power levels, plus a direct electronic readout that jives perfectly with digital electronics.Impact on Society and the EnvironmentEmbedding accurate gas sensors into everyday devices democratizes environmental monitoring. Imagine crowdsourced air-quality maps updated in real time by the phones in people’s pockets—no more wondering if that smog alert really applies to your street. Restaurants could scan spoilage gases at the pallet before it even reaches the shelves, slashing waste. Hospitals could breeze through breath-marker screenings for early disease detection, easing the load on lab facilities and cutting costs.Business and Strategy MovesWhat’s in it for the two partners? For Advent, it’s about broadening its patent fortress—around 150 issued or pending patents—and tapping into global semiconductor know-how. For the unnamed tech giant, it’s a chance to weave advancedsensor miniaturizationinto its chip roadmap, fast-tracking its entry into healthtech and environmental-monitoring markets.Both parties stand to gain from:Market Expansion:From city-wide air-monitoring networks to food-processing plants hungry for precise gas profiling.Healthtech Innovation:Telemedicine and point-of-care diagnostics are crying out for non-invasive, cost-effective screening tools.Consumer Electronics:Smartwatches, earbuds, and phones could boast a brand-new feature—molecular sensing on the go.Plus, this partnership could open licensing doors, as other device makers prefer adopting proven membrane materials rather than building them from scratch.Sizing Up the CompetitionBig names likeBoschandSonyhave rolled out MEMS-based gas sensors, but they often juggle power consumption and specificity. Advent’s Ion Pair platform could hit a unique sweet spot with robust performance at moderate temperatures, stellar selectivity, and seamless integration with the partner’s advanced wireless modules. Nail the cost curve, and these tiny sensors could shake up a market long dominated by bulky, less flexible modules.Livermore: Where Science Meets Startup VibeAdvent’s HQ inLivermore, California, sits smack in the innovation corridor that gave us Lawrence Livermore National Lab. With about 87,000 residents and a per-capita rent of $2,324, Livermore has transformed from a science outpost into a buzzing hub where material science collides with microelectronics and startup energy.Overcoming the Hurdles AheadMiniaturizing cutting-edge tech is never a cakewalk. The teams will need to:Prove long-term durability under repeated cyclingStamp out cross-sensitivity between different gasesMerge the membranes with existing chip-fabrication workflowsPerfect device packaging and power management to hit consumer-price targets in the cutthroat smartphone marketLooking Out to the HorizonIn the coming months, lab tests will put the Ion Pair sensors through their paces—checking sensitivity, selectivity, and endurance.

For Advent, it’s about broadening its patent fortress—around 150 issued or pending patents—and tapping into global semiconductor know-how. For the unnamed tech giant, it’s a chance to weave advancedsensor miniaturizationinto its chip roadmap, fast-tracking its entry into healthtech and environmental-monitoring markets.Both parties stand to gain from:Market Expansion:From city-wide air-monitoring networks to food-processing plants hungry for precise gas profiling.Healthtech Innovation:Telemedicine and point-of-care diagnostics are crying out for non-invasive, cost-effective screening tools.Consumer Electronics:Smartwatches, earbuds, and phones could boast a brand-new feature—molecular sensing on the go.Plus, this partnership could open licensing doors, as other device makers prefer adopting proven membrane materials rather than building them from scratch.Sizing Up the CompetitionBig names likeBoschandSonyhave rolled out MEMS-based gas sensors, but they often juggle power consumption and specificity.

Sounds like a stretch? Well, over$5 billionis already on the table, so it’s more reality than sci-fi. Thanks to the EU’sRED IIIpush and next year’sDelegated Acts, the race forindustrial decarbonizationis in full swing. So, how are these energy giants pivoting, why themaritime sectoris a game-changer, and what speed bumps are lurking ahead? Let’s break it down.Context: EU’s Regulatory PushTheEuropean Unionjust turned up the heat on climate goals, demanding industries slash emissions big time. UnderRED III, refiners have to swap out fossil hydrogen for renewable or low-carbon blends. On top of that, the 2025Delegated Actslay down the law on lifecycle greenhouse-gas cuts—so any hydrogen made via electrolysis or SMR with CCUS better meet those strict targets. Problem is, some member states are dragging their feet on national rulebooks, putting projects in limbo.The Refinery ShiftFor decades, oil hubs leaned on gray hydrogen straight from fossil fuels. Now, they’re plowing money intohydrogen productionthrough water electrolysis powered by sun and wind, or steam methane reforming paired with carbon capture, utilization, and storage. The payoff? Emissions could tumble by over 70%. Industry insiders say parts of the sector can green up fast and without breaking the bank. With capital commitments north of$5 billionand auction bids forgreen hydrogendropping—about 18% across the EU and a whopping 55% dive in German tenders—costs are finally heading south.Maritime OpportunityWe all know you can’t just slap a plug into a cargo ship—electrification at sea has limits.

It’s a bold bet onindustrial decarbonizationand the future ofsustainable energy, one that could redraw the continent’s energy map for decades to come.Spread the love TheEuropean Unionjust turned up the heat on climate goals, demanding industries slash emissions big time. UnderRED III, refiners have to swap out fossil hydrogen for renewable or low-carbon blends. On top of that, the 2025Delegated Actslay down the law on lifecycle greenhouse-gas cuts—so any hydrogen made via electrolysis or SMR with CCUS better meet those strict targets. Problem is, some member states are dragging their feet on national rulebooks, putting projects in limbo. For decades, oil hubs leaned on gray hydrogen straight from fossil fuels. Now, they’re plowing money intohydrogen productionthrough water electrolysis powered by sun and wind, or steam methane reforming paired with carbon capture, utilization, and storage. The payoff? Emissions could tumble by over 70%. Industry insiders say parts of the sector can green up fast and without breaking the bank. With capital commitments north of$5 billionand auction bids forgreen hydrogendropping—about 18% across the EU and a whopping 55% dive in German tenders—costs are finally heading south.Maritime OpportunityWe all know you can’t just slap a plug into a cargo ship—electrification at sea has limits.

That’s exactly whatPort of South Louisianahas in the works: a cutting-edgehydrogen fueling bargeready to pumpe-methanoland other green fuels straight into ships, totally changing the game for marine refueling.Project Overview and ScopeThe port has put out a call for bids on a custom-built vessel designed to carryGrade C flammable liquids. At its heart ise-methanol—a synthetic marine fuel crafted by combininggreen hydrogenfrom renewable electrolysis with captured CO₂. In plain terms, this barge turns the river into a refueling superhighway. It’s powered by a Build Back Better Regional Challenge grant from theU.S. Economic Development Administration, matched by funding and technical support fromLouisiana Economic Development. As part of theH2theFutureinitiative, the barge complements an array of projects—electrolyzers, hydrogen pipelines, workforce training programs—all aimed at acceleratingindustrial decarbonizationin South Louisiana.Comprehensive engineering and fabrication plans covering steel sourcing, internal coatings, and system integration.Performance guarantees for transfer rates and leak-prevention systems.Optional add-ons: long-term maintenance, crew training, and remote monitoring services.Proven safety expertise with hydrogen-based fuels and marine fueling systems.Technical Design HighlightsThis non-self-propelled, double-hulled steel barge packs:Five pairs of insulated cargo tanks with corrosion-resistant linings, perfect for storinge-methanol.A pump house capable of 6,000 barrels per hour loading and 1,000 gallons per minute offloading.Advanced safety gear: automatic leak detectors, remote shutoff valves, foam suppression, and secondary containment.Interchangeable hose connections compatible with existing shore-side bunker equipment.Future-ready pipework prepped for pure hydrogen transfer, making upgrades seamless as markets evolve.Designed to meet or exceedU.S. Coast GuardandEPAregulations, the barge features a SCADA system for real-time operations oversight—fueling everything from tugboats to small ferries.Strategic and Business BenefitsWhy float your fueling station? First off, vessels save hours by skipping back-and-forth trips, cutting congestion at busy docks and slashing operating costs. For the port, it unlocks new revenue streams—fuel sales margins, handling fees, service contracts, you name it. Withhydrogen infrastructureinvestment on the rise, South Louisiana scores a first-mover advantage. Early entry into thegreen hydrogenbunkering market positions the port as a hub forzero-emissiontech, attracting operators eager to meet stricter emissions standards. Plus, it boosts the port’s ESG profile, potentially lowering the cost of capital as financiers reward real decarbonization efforts.Advancing Industrial DecarbonizationThe Mississippi corridor already handles massive volumes of industrial hydrogen used in refining and chemical processes. Switching marine bunkering from diesel toe-methanolcan cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 100%, provided renewable feedstocks are used.

Every barge call usinge-methanolinstead of diesel prevents tons of local pollutants while supporting corporate sustainability goals.Regional Legacy and ContextSouth Louisiana’s energy story stretches back over a century, evolving from crude oil exports to a sprawling petrochemical powerhouse. ThePort of South Louisianaranks among the Western Hemisphere’s largest tonnage ports, moving grains, bulk commodities, and hydrocarbons. Beneath the surface, a dense network of hydrogen pipelines, storage terminals, and electrolyzers already feeds refineries and chemical plants. In 2022, this corridor was one of six U.S. regions tapped by the Build Back Better Regional Challenge for clean hydrogen cluster funding. The floating fueling barge is the latest chapter in a region rewriting its energy narrative for thesustainable energyera.Funding, Partnerships, and GovernanceThe project’s total budget is $74.5 million, pooled from:U.S. Economic Development Administration: Core grant funding under the Build Back Better Challenge.Louisiana Economic Development: State matching funds, permitting support, and workforce development programs.H2theFuture: A 25-member coalition guiding project alignment, technical reviews, and training pipelines.This alliance of federal, state, and private stakeholders shows how targeted policy incentives can unlock advanced clean-energy infrastructure.Timeline and Critical MilestonesBid submission deadline:August 28, 2025Contract award:by September 24, 2025Engineering & procurement:Q4 2025 – Q2 2026Fabrication & system integration:Q3 2026 – Q4 2026Sea trials & commissioning:Q1 2027Operational launch:March 31, 2027When it hits the water, this barge will be the first of its kind in the United States, cementing South Louisiana’s leadership inhydrogen productionand distribution.Risks, Challenges, and What to WatchAmbitious projects come with their share of hurdles:Supply chain pressureson specialized hoses, valves, and steel alloys could stretch fabrication schedules.Regulatory evolution: As state and federal agencies fine-tune hydrogen bunkering guidelines, designs may need adjustments.Feedstock economics: The price edge ofe-methanolhinges on renewable power costs and CO₂ sourcing.Workforce readiness: Fabricators, welders, and operators require training on new materials and safety procedures.Stakeholders should keep an eye on vendor proposals, permit updates, and market shifts in renewable power and CO₂ pricing.Looking Ahead and Broader ImplicationsThe Port of South Louisiana’s floating fueling station could serve as a lighthouse for maritime decarbonization. If this model proves workable, expect other inland and coastal ports to explore similarhydrogen infrastructureprojects. Down the road, we might see retrofitted barges dispensing green ammonia or even pumping pure hydrogen into fuel cell–powered vessels. For now, all eyes are on the bids, the build, and that game-changing launch.Spread the love Strategic and Business BenefitsWhy float your fueling station? First off, vessels save hours by skipping back-and-forth trips, cutting congestion at busy docks and slashing operating costs. For the port, it unlocks new revenue streams—fuel sales margins, handling fees, service contracts, you name it. Withhydrogen infrastructureinvestment on the rise, South Louisiana scores a first-mover advantage. Early entry into thegreen hydrogenbunkering market positions the port as a hub forzero-emissiontech, attracting operators eager to meet stricter emissions standards. Plus, it boosts the port’s ESG profile, potentially lowering the cost of capital as financiers reward real decarbonization efforts.Advancing Industrial DecarbonizationThe Mississippi corridor already handles massive volumes of industrial hydrogen used in refining and chemical processes.

The plant is a key link in GWM’s global network bridging China and Latin America, a real frontline in the drive forindustrial decarbonizationunder Brazil’s blazing sun and humid skies.After sealing a 2023 MoU with the São Paulo State Government to explore hydrogen applications,GWMdidn’t waste a moment: by 2024, five refueling stations had popped up across the state. On day one in Iracemápolis, the factory rolled out a rig packing a 105 kWh battery and a 40 kg hydrogen tank. Starting this September, these trucks will hit the highways of São Paulo and Minas Gerais for road tests in partnership with theUniversity of São PauloandUNIFEI. The mission? Prove that thiszero-emission technologycan haul heavy loads, top up in minutes, and run on bothgreen hydrogenand ethanol-sourced hydrogen. Over 1,000 km of real-world trials will reveal the true range under full load.Here’s the scoop: on August 16, the Iracemápolis plant flung open its doors, unveiling Brazil’s first operational fuel cell electric truck. The state governments of São Paulo and Minas Gerais are backing the project, following a November 2024 agreement withUNIFEIto build outgreen hydrogensupply andhydrogen infrastructure. So far, five hydrogen stations are up and running, aligning with Brazil’s MOVER program to clean up freight transport. FTXT even ran initial trials with prototype units in 2024.The upcoming tests will tackle loading cycles, range demos across tropical lowlands and plateau regions, and refueling drills. Data fromUSPandUNIFEI—think vehicle telemetry, fuel economy, and system durability—will feed back into product tweaks and an export playbook for Chinese hydrogen solutions eyeing global markets hungry for sustainable energy options.Dive into the tech, and you’ll see FTXT’s customhydrogen fuel celltechnology at the core. It pairs a 105 kWh lithium-ion battery with a high-pressure fuel cell stack fueled by 40 kg of compressed hydrogen, emitting nothing but water vapor. They’re touting a 60% peak efficiency, though real-world numbers might flex a bit. Hydrogen tanks store the gas at 350 bar, and early dry runs have already logged cold-start performance and thermal management under Brazil’s summertime heatwaves.Fuel comes from two sources: renewable-powered electrolysis and ethanol reforming—leveraging Brazil’s biofuel infrastructure to diversifyhydrogen production. Mixing these methods in the pilot will highlight cost and performance trade-offs, guiding decisions on scaling, logistics, and local feedstock availability.This launch is China’s clean-energy exporters making a calculated play.GWMand its unit,FTXT Energy Tech, are cementing their footprint in Latin America, while Brazil secures tech transfer and workforce upskilling. The 2023 MoU with São Paulo set the stage; the 2024 pact with Minas Gerais strengthened a network spanning R&D, refueling, and policy alignment.Officials tout this as a blueprint for regional adoption ofhydrogen infrastructure. For GWM, it’s about credibility and market share in the globalhydrogen fuel cellsrace. For Brazil, it underscores its strategic pivot away from diesel and a commitment to carbon-neutral targets without compromising heavy freight capabilities—riding the wave of China’s Belt and Road green-energy projects.Brazil’s biofuel journey began in the 1970s, but heavy-duty trucks have lagged behind. Electric trucks have hit range and charging constraints that hydrogen can sidestep with rapid refuels and longer hauls. Still, the hydrogen roadmap has steep hurdles: high electrolyzer costs, swinging ethanol feedstock prices, and capital-intensivehydrogen infrastructurerollouts. Regulators also face the task of crafting safety codes for handling high-pressure hydrogen—a non-trivial undertaking.Even with five stations in São Paulo, nationwide coverage is years away. Market forces—fuel price volatility, maintenance demands, competition from battery trucks—will test whether hydrogen shifts from pilot stage to mainstream solution. Logistics in remote areas could also trip up supply consistency.This program isn’t just about semis; it’s about building talent and ecosystems. Researchers atUSPandUNIFEIwill get hands-on experience, and local technicians will learn to service fuel cell stacks and refueling hubs. We’re talking dozens of high-skill jobs in engineering, maintenance, and logistics—laying a foundation forindustrial decarbonizationin the region.Beyond new employment, this initiative sparks knowledge transfer that could turbocharge Brazil’s own R&D ingreen hydrogen, setting the stage for cross-sector rollouts in shipping, industry, and power generation—essential for genuineindustrial decarbonization. Word is local spare-part supply chains are already forming around Iracemápolis.Seeing a hydrogen-fueled 18-wheeler roar to life in Brazil is downright thrilling. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves—hype can outpace economics. Unless green hydrogen costs plummet and supply chains prove bulletproof, this may stay a flashy pilot rather than a freight revolution. I’ll be watching the price-per-kilometer and downtime stats before popping any celebratory corks. And remember: a few breakdowns could dash political goodwill faster than you think.Trials kick off in September 2025, and monthly updates fromUSPandUNIFEIwill drop performance metrics. If the data checks out, GWM will press for broader rollouts across Latin America. If not, this project might become a textbook case on the limits of early-stage hydrogen tech. Stakeholders will also be eyeing public acceptance and regulatory tweaks needed for widerhydrogen infrastructuredeployment.Spread the love After sealing a 2023 MoU with the São Paulo State Government to explore hydrogen applications,GWMdidn’t waste a moment: by 2024, five refueling stations had popped up across the state.

Well, meet the match you didn’t see coming.H2 Power ’n’ Heat GmbHhas dropped its modularH2 Power Boxunits right next to the waste site run byH2 Core Systems GmbHin Germany’s Gifhorn district. Nestled in Ausbüttel’s rolling meadows, thisRenewable energy pilotis quietly cranking out zero-emission power and heat exactly where it’s needed. Buckle up—off-grid power just got a major upgrade.Since 2016, Berlin-basedH2 Power ’n’ Heathas been tinkering with mobile and stationary systems that turnGreen hydrogeninto clean electricity and warmth. Meanwhile,H2 Core Systems GmbH, headquartered near Heide, has been perfecting full-cycle hydrogen solutions—fromelectrolyzersto fuel cells—for factories, infrastructure, and everything in between. After countless lab tests, field trials, and those “eureka” moments, these two agile SMEs teamed up to show the world howDecentralized energycan roll out at startup speed, not on a decade-long government schedule.This pilot sits next to a waste site cradled by woodlands and farmland—proof that you don’t need giga-projects or fancy pipelines to makeHydrogen fuel cellswork. Just drop a few modules, hook up the plumbing, and watch them hum away, cutting noise, smells, and carbon footprints all at once.And here’s the kicker: you don’t have to slog through years of planning. These micro-pilots spin up in weeks, not years. That’s the magic ofDecentralized energy: instant deployment, instant impact.Local councils and environmental agencies jumped on board early, seeing gold in regional decarbonization and circular economy innovation. Whether you run a farm, a festival, or a B&B, you can plug in this setup without calling in a battalion of engineers—just good old off-grid power you can brag about over coffee and have live by lunchtime.What This MeansPure zero-emission output: Wave goodbye to soot, smog, and local pollutants.Grid-friendly microgrid: Replaces diesel generators, eases peak-load stress, and keeps lights on when the main grid stumbles.Circular economy win: Turns landfill byproducts into a clean energy loop—waste meetsGreen hydrogen.Budget-stable fueling: Hydrogen refills tame the wild swings of diesel prices.Modular scaling: Snap in as manyH2 Power Boxunits as you need—no oversized generators draining cash.Smoother logistics: Shipping hydrogen beats hauling oil for safety and simplicity.Municipalities, rural communities, and industrial parks can finally lock in predictable energy costs without sweating surprise bills or emissions fines. This isn’t sci-fi—it’s a real-worldRenewable energy pilotthat provesOff-grid powercan be robust, reliable, and eco-friendly.Imagine remote telecom towers, island clinics, or mountain lodges ditching diesel for whisper-quiet hydrogen fuel cells. Cleaner air, fewer particulates, and healthier wildlife—now that’s a win-win.The Technology: The Magic IngredientH2 Power Box fuel cell modules: Plug-and-play units that convert stored hydrogen into electricity and heat through electrochemical magic—no combustion, no exhaust.Electrolyzers: Powered by renewable juice, these split water into hydrogen and oxygen, then stash that hydrogen in slick composite tanks until you call on it.At the heart of it all areproton exchange membrane (PEM)stacks—quick to fire up and unfazed by frosty mornings in Lower Saxony. The electrolyzers can throttle their power draw to match wind or solar availability, making this duo the dream team for pairing with on-site turbines or PV arrays.Safety nerds rejoice: every module ticks EU compliance boxes, from double containment to seamless SCADA or IoT integration for remote monitoring. And don’t overlook the waste heat—it can warm offices, greenhouses, or industrial processes, nudging overall efficiency above 80%.Real-World TestRight beside Ausbüttel’s landfill near Gifhorn, the team hauled in crates ofH2 Power Boxmodules and bid farewell to cranky diesel gensets. Since flicking the switch, thisRenewable energy pilothas been quietly powering key operations:Illuminating maintenance sheds and perimeter lights.Delivering cozy heat to admin buildings and workshops.Operating silently—no smoke stacks or on-site emissions.Numbers are still rolling in, but early chatter praises the uptime and steady performance. Thanks to the modular design, from delivery to go-live took mere weeks. Operators keep tabs via a slick mobile dashboard, getting instant alerts if hydrogen pressure dips or upkeep is due. When locals popped by for open days, they left with jaws on the floor—a landfill never felt so futuristic.Strategic AngleZoom out, and you’ll see this project is a perfect fit for Germany’sEnergiewendeand the EU’s bigger push forGreen hydrogen. While the giants chase mega-hubs, nimble SMEs likeH2 Power ’n’ Heat GmbHandH2 Core Systems GmbHare swooping in to fill the gaps, proving real impact can happen on a regional timetable, not three parliaments down the road.Public funds and incentives have poured billions into hydrogen R&D, and this pilot shows how fast that cash can spark circular economy gold. Partnering with Fraunhofer and other research outfits meant rigorous testing and quicker certifications. Plus, all that data streaming out of Ausbüttel is a regulator’s dream—fueling smarter safety rules, permitting processes, and grid-connection guidelines.Don’t overlook the ripple effects through local supply chains either: tank fabricators, service workshops, and engineering firms are all scoring new business, creating fresh green-tech jobs. And when clouds roll in or winds drop, these hydrogen backup systems stand ready to fill the gap—perfect for smoothing out intermittent renewables.Zooming OutRollout at dozens of landfills, factories, and logistics hubs craving resilience.New training programs and green jobs sprouting up in regional towns.On-siteGreen hydrogenhubs paired with solar farms or biogas units, creating self-contained energy ecosystems.EU-wide pilot networks standardizingDecentralized energymicrogrids and boosting cross-border collaboration.Analysts predict microgrids could be as widespread as rooftop solar by 2035, shifting the market toward software, integration, and service.This isn’t a lab gimmick—it’s a ready-to-roll blueprint. That once-quiet landfill in Gifhorn is now a beacon of zero-emission power and heat. If you’re overseeing a municipality, an industrial park, or a waste facility and you want to kick diesel to the curb while supercharging resilience,Hydrogen fuel cellsare your ticket—today, not someday.Dream big: replicate at multiple sites, weave in demand-side management, or tap into surplus wind, solar, or biogas for yourGreen hydrogenfeedstock.

This UK start-up, spun out ofImperial College Londonin 2024, just closed a £1.2 million seed round and scored a £25,000 grant from theHenry Royce Institute. Their secret sauce? A novelmetallic nanofiber mesh electrodethat promises to superchargeelectrolyser performance—and could sliceproduction costsby 20–30%.Born from seven years of tinkering at Imperial’sEnergy Futures Lab, the founding crew—four PhD chemists and two electrochemical engineers—has already locked down two patent families coveringmetal electrospinning recipesandbinderless mesh architectures. In short, they’ve built a fortress around their IP as they gear up to scale. And with industry veterans on their advisory board for electrolyser manufacturing and scale-up, they’re hardly flying blind.Strategic UpsideEarly institutional backing isn’t just a gold star; it’s a green light for more investors and strategic partnerships. Even better, M-Spin’s retrofit-friendly design lets operators drop these mats into existing electrolyser stacks—no rip-and-replace required. That kind of simplicity sings to:Electrolyser OEMshunting for a quick product boost without reinventing the wheel.Project developerschasing lower capex and faster commissioning.Energy retailerskeen to lock in bulkgreen hydrogensupplies and tighten margins.Europe’s push for 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen by 2030 means massive upside for low-cost electrolysers. M-Spin’s already in talks with anchor customers in the UK and Germany, where procurement pipelines are heating up. Their mesh could fast-track profitability for gigawatt-scale facilities by trimming upfront spend and boosting runtime efficiency.Technical SnapshotAt the core is a fresh spin onelectrospinning. Instead of polymer or carbon fibers, M-Spin’s R&D team—shout-out to Professor Nigel Brandon’s lab—has dialed in metal-based recipes. Here’s the nutshell version:Fiber diameter:500 nm to 1 µm, balancing toughness with high surface exposure.Porosity:Up to 90%, which smoothed out mass transport of reactants and gas release.Surface area:As much as 1,000× that of metallic foams, multiplying active sites for water splitting—the core ofhydrogen production.Material versatility:Nickel, iron, copper and ceramics—each tuned to specific electrolyser chemistries.In lab-scale trials (50 cm² electrodes), they’ve hit current densities north of industry benchmarks, running stably at 1 A/cm² for more than 100 hours. Next up: scaling to 1 m² modules, with demo units planned for Q1 2026. And roll-to-roll tests at the Henry Royce Institute show the concept can stretch to industrial volumes.Historical MomentumFor too long, electrode tech was the choke point inelectrolysis. Early alkaline and PEM systems leaned on clunky metal foams with limited active area. Nanostructured fixes have popped up in journals over the past decade, but few ever made the leap from lab to factory. M-Spin’s mesh fuses nanoscale engineering with manufacturing pragmatism—just as Europe’s Hydrogen Strategy and the UK’s Ten Point Plan unlock over £1 billion forsustainable energyandindustrial decarbonizationprojects.Competitive LandscapeIt’s a crowded arena: legacy electrolyser makers still rely on sintered foams and mesh from big suppliers like Linde, while a handful of start-ups in Germany and the US chase nano-coated or laser-etched electrodes. M-Spin’s edge? A native nanofiber network that skips costly coatings and extra post-processing steps. In plain English, that means a lower cost per square meter of electrode—critical when you’re rolling out multi-gigawatt installations.Market OutlookGlobal electrolysis capacity is poised to leap from under 2 GW today to over 100 GW by 2030, driven by net-zero pledges and booming renewables. Annual hydrogen market revenues could top $300 billion by mid-decade. In that landscape, a 20–30% capex cut in electrolysers translates into tens of billions saved. For early movers like M-Spin, that’s a shot at serious market share—provided the performance and durability live up to expectations.Technical HurdlesThe real test lies in long-haul durability: corrosion resistance, mechanical fatigue under cyclical loads, and survival in harsh alkaline or acidic environments. M-Spin’s 100-hour runs are a promising start, but 10,000-hour data will make or break their levelized cost-of-hydrogen models. And building roll-to-roll modules means nailing thermal management and seal integrity to prevent membrane damage and gas crossover.Collateral ImpactsIf this nanomesh delivers, the ripple effects could reshape multiple sectors:Heavy industry:Green hydrogenat $1.50–2.00/kg could finally decarbonize steel, refining and ammonia.Ammonia production:Lower energy inputs might cut fertilizer costs—a boon for global food security.Mobility:Fuel cell fleets become more cost-effective as fuel expenses drop.Energy storage:More efficient electrolyser-capacitor hybrids smooth out renewable intermittency.Supply chains:Demand for nickel, copper and ceramics spikes, fueling upstream investment.Fuel cell tech:These mesh designs could boost electrode performance in fuel cell mode too.Beyond just cutting costs, these shifts fuel broadersustainable energyadoption and underscorehydrogen’s role in industrial decarbonization.Main InsightsPrototypes show up to5× higher hydrogen outputand20–30% cost reduction, according to M-Spin—results that look great but still need independent verification.Roll-to-roll processing combined with retrofit compatibility slashes deployment times compared to greenfield redesigns.Backing from Imperial’s spin-out ecosystem and the Henry Royce Institute accelerates iteration cycles and rigorous testing.Next StepsM-Spin is gearing up pilot-scale trials at Imperial’s hydrogen labs to prove multi-thousand-hour durability. They’re negotiating licensing deals with OEMs across Europe and Asia to fast-track market entry, and exploring dual-use mesh designs that work in bothelectrolysisand fuel cell modes—streamlining supply chains for end users.Expert ViewpointFrom where I’m sitting, M-Spin nails a critical balance: a high-performance nanostructure that’s genuinely scalable. The long-duration data will be the ultimate decider, but if they hit their cost and durability targets, expect faster project approvals, bolder offtake deals and a reconfigured investment picture forsustainable energyinfrastructure. Whether you’re an investor hunting for the next big thing inelectrolysisor an operator chasing a lower TCO, M-Spin’s nanomesh deserves a hard look—it just might be the materials breakthrough that pushesgreen hydrogeninto the mainstream.Spread the love Born from seven years of tinkering at Imperial’sEnergy Futures Lab, the founding crew—four PhD chemists and two electrochemical engineers—has already locked down two patent families coveringmetal electrospinning recipesandbinderless mesh architectures.

Jordan’s Cabinet of Ministers have approved a project that will install solar systems at the homes of people with disabilities. According to the Jordan News Agency, the five-year project will run between 2026 and 2030 and cost JOD 1.5 million ($2.1 million). It plans to install grid-connected solar systems for 1,000 homes belonging to disabled people or the families, based on submitted applications. A technical committee comprising representatives from the country’s Ministries of Energy, Social Development and the Higher Council for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will oversee implementation criteria. Jordan’s government has been described as “progressive” on clean energy, with a particular focus on incentivizing small-scale solar and heat pump installations. In September 2024, the country’srebate schemefor residential solar restarted, covering up to 30% of the cost of buying and installing a solar system. The scheme isbackedby some of the country’s leading banks. Jordan’s cumulative solar capacity stood at 2,077 MW at the end of 2024, up from 1,990 MW at the end of the year prior, according to figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).In May, the Jordanian government opened a200 MWsolar tender.

A group of researchers from the Polytechnic University of Cartagena and the University of Castilla–La Mancha studied real-life self-consumption photovoltaic installations that reflect the current profiles of Spanish prosumers. They evaluated 2,640 generation profiles from rooftop systems with nominal power outputs of 3 kW to 5 kW over a full year of operation. A common trend among installers is the search for the optimal tilt and orientation to maximize output. But it is not always possible to reach these values on all roofs, so they are artificially “targeted.” These non-coplanar installations carry notable drawbacks, including structural complexity, higher costs, and increased roof loads. In contrast, coplanar designs, where modules are aligned with the existing building surface, deliver nearly equivalent generation at significantly lower cost. The study, “Alternative non-optimal orientations in highly PV self-consumption integration: Exploring Spanish prosumers as a case study,” published inRenewable Energy,offers new data on the viability of residential self-consumption photovoltaic installations in a wide range of rooftop configurations. Contrary to the widespread belief that optimal energy production requires precise orientation and tilt, the results show that most existing rooftops can achieve competitive economic performance with their natural geometry. In fact, when system design takes into account household demand profiles and appropriate sizing of peak power, payback periods remain favorable, even comparable to or better than those of conventional optimized configurations, according to the study's authors. Only roofs with extreme, predominantly north-facing slopes present significant performance drawbacks. Once the compensation mechanism has been established, energy prices have been set, and the consumption profile has been selected, the compensation results and the annual savings achieved for each generation profile can be calculated. The annual savings achieved for each generation profile allow for calculating the payback period, i.e., the number of years required to recover the investment cost. The results of this study underscore the potential for wider adoption of photovoltaics without the need for structural modifications, reinforcing the feasibility of leveraging existing rooftop conditions in residential environments. This phenomenon is largely attributed to better temporal alignment between electricity production and domestic consumption during peak tariff hours, especially in time-of-use and self-consumption pricing structures with surplus compensation systems. “These results challenge the traditional paradigm that maximizing energy production should be the primary design objective for small-scale photovoltaic systems,” the authors explain. Instead, they support a more nuanced approach that prioritizes the system's economic performance, taking into account both market price variability and the self-consumption ratio. “Furthermore, the data presented highlight the importance of evolving remuneration mechanisms to fairly compensate prosumers, not only based on the volume of energy injected into the grid, but also on the temporal and systemic value of their contribution to local distribution networks,” they add. The scientists suggest that policymakers rethink the design of support programs and regulatory frameworks: “Traditional policies have tended to reward total energy generation, but this work shows that this approach may not be consistent with optimal grid integration or economic efficiency. Instead, policy instruments that incentivize demand-driven system design and reward local self-consumption, such as dynamic tariffs, smart metering incentives, or capacity-based subsidies, are recommended. These initiatives could accelerate PV deployment and reduce pressure on the grid,” they conclude. Finally, for system operators and grid planners, the study highlights the role that decentralized, demand-synchronized PV systems can play in stabilizing local grids and improving load management. In this context, the methodology provides a valuable tool for assessing the potential of distributed generation—that is, when and how energy is injected into or demanded from the grid.

Researchers from Canada’sWestern Universityhave experimentally tested the yield of romaine lettuce in agrivolaric set-ups, with different transparency and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) levels in an effort to define a clear relationship between PV transparency, PAR, and crop productivity. “To our knowledge, no prior research has systematically tested how varying PV transparencies affect PAR and crop yields in a controlled environment,” corresponding author Uzair Jamil toldpv magazine. “Our study uniquely quantifies the impact of a wide range of PV transparencies on PAR and crop performance, providing empirical findings that can inform agrivoltaic policy. By contextualizing these results within already matured agrivoltaic jurisdictions globally, the study offers novel insights for regions like Canada, where policy has yet to fully integrate the agrivoltaic potential.” The experiment was conducted in a controlled environment, where conditions in the biomes were representative of outdoor summer in London, Ontario, Canada. Daytime temperatures were maintained at 25 C, while nighttime temperatures were set at 19 C. To supplement illumination during the 16-h daylight phase, four 600 W high-pressure sodium fixtures were used. Seven different transparencies of cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin film solar modules, namely 10%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% and 80%. Six lettuce plants were cultivated under each module, while eight were planted without the modules to act as a control. Image: Western University, Journal of Cleaner Production, CC BY 4.0 “The experimental timeline begins with seeding three plants per pot on February 21, 2024. The first emergence of lettuce plants was observed on day 6, followed by the initial thinning of pots on day 12, reducing pots with three germinated seeds to two plants per pot. Final thinning occurred on day 20, establishing a single plant per pot across all treatments,” the team stated. “Fertilization was commenced on 20 March 2024, with subsequent applications on day 34, day 40, day 44, and day 47. Each pot received 0.75 g of fertilizer dissolved in 0.5 L of water per application.” Measuring the PAR throughout the experiment and the lettuce yield at harvest, the researchers found that the 10% transparency module exhibited the lowest values in both PAR and fresh weight of lettuce. PAR values ranged from 43.75 to 52.34 micromol/m2-s, while fresh weight varied between less than 1 g and 15 g. The 80% transparency module yielded the most favorable outcomes, with PAR values ranging from 70.31 to 117.19 micromol/m2-s, and fresh weight spanning from 34 to 424 g. The mean fresh weight of lettuce harvested from the control treatment was 417 g with a PAR value of 129.69 micromol/m2s. Using those results, the team has tested the worthiness of growing lettuce under PV panels in four European markets. They checked Germany, where regulation rule that the crop should keep at least 66% of its yield; in France, were crops have to maintain 90% of their yield; in Itay, where a maximum PV land coverage of 40% is set; and in the Czech Republic, where only 10% are allowed to be covered by PV. “One of the most surprising outcomes was the degree to which agrivoltaic policies could influence land use decisions and overall adoption,” said Jamil. “Our findings indicate that PV system design and module configuration not only directly affect crop yields but also have broader implications for how policymakers might incentivize or restrict agrivoltaic integration, highlighting the critical role of policy design in maximizing both energy and food production.” The results of the study indicated that a minimum yield requirement could be set at 70%. This means that the German policy appears to be the most consistent with available data for maximizing agrivoltaic benefits while minimizing detriment. “More importantly, policy makers should consider the use of dynamic mandates with a review cycle, i.e., 5 years minimum, to ensure policy alignment with evolving technological trends and agricultural practices,” the academics concluded. Their findings were presented in “Photosynthetically active radiation complexities in agrivoltaic policy mandates: Insights from controlled environment yields under semitransparent photovoltaics,” published in theJournal of Cleaner Production.

The proposed approach works “effectively” without heavy data requirements, according to its creators. Researchers at Algeria's Université de Ghardaia have developed a new method to enhance PV cleaning schedules that ensures independence from extensive datasets. “Our method functions effectively without heavy data requirements,” the research's lead author,Charaf AbdelkarimMosbah, toldpv magazine. “It combines maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques, metaheuristic optimisation, and an intelligent cleaning score mechanism (ICSM).” In the study “Smart and cost-effective optimisation of photovoltaic cleaning schedules,” published inEnergy and Buildings, the research team explained that themethod allows for “optimal” decision-making in both real-time and offline settings, thereby reducing unnecessarycleaningoperations and improving overall energy yield. “What makes our approach stand out is its seamless integration with existing MPPT systems, enabling immediate deployment without further investment in hardware or data infrastructure,” Mosbah went on to say. The scientists explained that cleaning operations require two fundamental steps – assessing cleanliness and making a decision – and noted that cleaning becomes “essential” only when the dust accumulates and persists on the module surfaces, with the analysis focusing on faults with constant or gradual characteristics. The proposed method differentiates between two distinct MPPT operation modes: the exploration phase, when the algorithm actively seeks the MPP; and the exploitation phase, when the MPP has been reached. It also distinguishes between partial shading and uniform irradiance modes and defines the search space of each decision variable independently, which the scientists said is not the case with many other algorithms. The new methodology uses ICSM to simplify dust accumulation detection. It initially evaluates if the PV system is operating normally or under partial shading, with the data being analyzed in real-time in conjunction with MPPT or evaluated later offline. “This feature allows the method to be applied during system downtime, enabling maintenance tasks, including cleaning schedule planning, to be efficiently managed without disrupting energy production,” the research group emphasized. The novel approach also utilizes an intelligent counter to accumulate the results of the data analysis. “Our experimental results demonstrated a 98.4% accuracy in predicting optimalcleaningschedules, achieving superior performance compared to three other benchmark algorithms,” Mosbah stated. The research team claims their new solution can be applied to all PV systems, including large-scale solar plants, with no additional costs.

However, despite hundreds of objections, its commission voted to repeal its renewable energy standard, letting its utilities take the wheel and head back toward more gas. Image: Wing-Chi Poon - Own work, CC BY-SA 2.5 The Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) voted 5-0 to repeal the state’s nearly two-decade-old renewable energy standards for the state’s regulated investor-owned utilities. The Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff Rules (REST) require Arizona’s regulated utilities to source at least 15% of the electricity they sell from renewable sources, 30% of which must come from rooftop solar or other distributed renewable sources. Nineteen years since its implementation, the mandate has seemingly paid off, with renewable energy accounting for 20% of Arizona’s total net generation, two-thirds of which is from solar, according to theUS Energy Information Administration(EIA). ACC Vice Chair Nick Myers said the renewable energy mandates are outdated and that utilities should be able to have the flexibility to choose their energy mix themselves without being burdened by government-imposed rules. He said renewable energy mandates drive up costs for customers, but he did not provide support to explain this conclusion. REST generated gross benefits for utility customers and the public totaling over $1.5 billion for Arizona Public Service (APS) and over $469 million for Tucson Electric Power (TEP) from 2008 to 2018, a 2020 report by Ceres found. Thestudyalso found REST resulted in an estimated $12 billion in clean-energy investments. “It is naive to think that repealing the REST will not have direct impacts on Arizona families,” said Itzel Rios-Vega, Vote Solar’s Interior West regional director. “We urge the commission not to surrender its responsibility to guide Arizona’s energy future.” For arid regions like Arizona, solar is particularly important because it uses far less water than other forms of generation. From 2008 to 2018, REST played “a crucial role in reducing pollution and delivering substantial water savings of 7,129-acre feet annually- enough water to serve the needs of nearly 44,000 Arizonans each year, an invaluable resource in our arid state,” the Ceres report found. Additionally, because Arizona has no significant gas reserves, it must import gas from out of state. However, Arizona is drenched in sunshine to tap for energy generation, so much so that it holds theGuinness Book of World Recordsfor “most sunshine.” The public’s concerns extend beyond clean energy, saving water and lowering costs. The retirement of renewable energy credits (RECs) is Arizona’s only legal mechanism to ensure exclusive claims over renewable generation, said Lucas Grimes, a senior manager of policy at Center for Resource Solutions. “Without REST there would be no enforceable REC retirement obligation for regulated utilities,” Grimes said. “Utilities could sell RECs while also marketing the same electricity to customers as ‘renewable’ or ‘clean,’ creating significant risk of greenwashing.” Thepublic commentsthat were opposed included: APS was amongonlypublic comments explicitly in favor of the repeal. The investor-owned utility said many of its current contractual relationships that resulted from the mandate will still be in effect regardless of whether the standard is repealed. APS cited the payments it receives through rate riders, adjustors and renewable energy programs, authorized by many past commission orders, and said it will still be paid if the mandate is repealed. ThoughGrand Canyon State Electric Cooperative Association(GCSECA) said it generally supports the repeal because the rule has burdensome filing requirements. However, it urged the commission to keep the current program, tariffs and surcharges in place and establish a replacement approval process. The commission’s chair, Kevin Thompson, has ties to gas utilities, specifically in drumming up new business for gas and pipelines for the business. For over 12 years, he worked for Southwest Gas Corp., where he was responsible for the gas company’s sale, design and installation of “billions of dollars of natural gas pipelines.” APS has previously pointed to its ambitious goal for carbon-free electricity by 2050. The utility never made much progress beyond the state’s mandate, and the day before the commission’s decision to repeal the mandate,announcedit was abandoning the goal. Instead, APS said it will aim for “carbon neutrality.” That same day, APS announced a new gas project, which will involve a new transmission line to import gas. APS expects the imported gas will cost $7.3 billion over 25 years, APS parent company Pinnacle West said afilingwith the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Laying out the regulated utility’s financial developments and outlook, Pinnacle West noted the several actions APS and the ACC took that either increased how much consumers pay to APS or decreased how much APS pays to others, including, but not limited to, multiple rate increases onto consumers, changes to rate designs to reduce “cross-subsidization by certain customer classes (currently ongoing) and so forth. “None of this should surprise anyone,” Arizona’s Public Health Association said in a statement. “Voters put commissioners in office who openly favor fossil fuels over clean energy.” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, who was on the ACC when it implemented REST in 2006, wrote aletterto the ACC, outlining the many implications that REST’s repeal would have on ratepayers. She noted the recent Lazard report that said utility-scale solar costs have fallen by 84% since 2009, and a Brattle report for PJM that found utility-scale solar and wind are cheaper to construct than new natural gas, coal and nuclear plants, and how relying on natural gas pipelines causes higher electric bills. She outlined the ACC’s failure to provide evidence in its statements that solar is more expensive than gas and increasing costs for its ratepayers, calling it “speculation at best.” In a signal of a potential lawsuit to come, Mayes said, “In addition to being bad policy, repealing the REST Rules as proposed here is an unlawful abdication of the commission’s duty to set just and reasonable rates,” she said. “Ratemaking decisions must be just and reasonable, which means they must be supported by substantial evidence, not arbitrary, and lawfully made. The Commission’s decision must be based on high-quality evidence, not speculation and conjecture.” This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

Solar curtailment in Ireland has increased sevenfold since 2022, the report found. During the first six months of 2025, 88.725 GWh of solar wascurtailedin the Irish Single Energy Market (ISEM), according to a report by Montel Energy, which looks at renewable energy curtailment in both Ireland and Great Britain. Solar curtailment in Ireland has increased seven-fold since 2022. Montel’s report noted that enough wind and solar generation has been curtailed on the island of Ireland to meet all domestic electricity consumption in County Dublin from January to June 2025. Fintan Devenney, senior energy analyst, Montel Energy, toldpv magazinethat the system in ISEM is “struggling to cope with the rapid increase in solar generation capacity.” “Downward dispatch (Ireland's term for power that is produced but can't be used) volumes of solar are dramatically higher than they were a few years ago,” he added. “Often the reasons are due to local constraints or system level issues around too much renewable output for the grid to handle.” ISEM includes Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and is jointly managed by the system operators of both jurisdictions – EirGrid in the Republic and SONI in Northern Ireland. In Marchpv magazinereported that Northern Irelanddoubled its solar curtailmentin 2024, turning down 16.9% of its solar that year, up from 7.9% in 2023. Meanwhile, Devenney described Great Britain’s solar curtailment as “fairly negligible.” Less than 0.1% of the total curtailed volume in Great Britain during H1, 2025 was from solar, he said. The report stated that less than 1 GWh of solar was turned down over the last three years. However, it also referred to data from Great Britain’s system operator NESO, which suggests that solar self-curtailment volumes could rise to between 10 and 20 TWh by 2040. “It is likely to be the case that solar assets will begin to cannibalize each other’s revenue and result in self-curtailment in future, as reported by NESO,” said Devenney. He emphasized the fact that NESO is referring to self-curtailment, meaning the solar would be curtailed for economic reasons rather than lack of generation availability. The Montel analyst toldpv magazinethat the future self-curtailment “would likely be due to increased amounts of negative pricing and subsidy contracts running out. The NESO figures are modeled in an unconstrained system, so the reason is not to do with curtailments from constraints. There could be additional curtailment volumes for solar in future as a result of constraints, but those aren’t modeled in the NESO figures.” Great Britain curtailed a total of 4.6 TWh of electricity in the first six months of this year, while ISEM's total was 905 GWh. In both markets, wind was the main source of renewable energy curtailed. In Great Britain, Northern Scotland accounted for 86% of the total curtailment volume, with more than 4 TWh of wind curtailed in the first six months of 2025. During this period, more than GBP 116 million was paid to wind farms in the region, accounting for 76% of total curtailment costs in Great Britain. Northern Scotland is one of the Great British market’s biggest generation areas; its low population density and cool, windy climate make it an ideal location for big batteries and wind farms. The electricity generated by these batteries and wind farms gets sent to densely populated, high demand areas like London via the grid. However, limited grid capacity to transfer a lot of this power means much of it is curtailed, particularly at the transmission border areas.

It claims this enables low-temperature mass production with minimal substrate damage. Photo:pv magazine, Mark Hutchins Sumitomo Heavy Industries has developed a new deposition technology for ultra-thin electron transport layers, a key component of next-generation perovskite solar cells. The Tokyo-based company said in a press release this week that the method uses cost-effective materials and a low-impact process, addressing major barriers to scaling perovskite technologies for mass production. Perovskite solar cells include multiple functional layers, SHI said, explaining that one layer is an electron transport layer deposited either above or below the electricity-generating perovskite layer. SHI noted that the electron transport layer plays a crucial role by allowing electrons generated in the perovskite layer to move efficiently to the electrode. To meet this function, the layer must have conduction bands capable of accepting these electrons. It is also important that the layer is deposited without harming the perovskite layer, which remains highly sensitive to elevated temperatures, explained the Tokyo-based industrial group. “Although they are cost-effective and suitable for mass production, conventional formation methods typically involve high energy particles and high-temperature environments,” said SHI. “This, in turn, will make them incompatible with perovskite materials. Thus, manufacturers are actively exploring chemical film deposition methods.” However, SHI acknowledged that this approach is still challenging due to high material costs, the difficulty in scaling up production, and the utilization of flammable or toxic precursor gases. It claimed that its RPD method, a type of physical vapor deposition (PVD), overcomes these challenges by enabling deposition of tin oxide (SnO2) films with insulating properties suitable for electron transport layers, achieving what it claims is a world-first for PVD-based ETLs. RPD facilitates low-temperature, rapid, large-area deposition with minimal substrate damage, using non-hazardous gases and reducing environmental impact, said SHI. It claimed that the new technology also allows continuous integration of ETL deposition with transparent conductive film (TCF) deposition, such as indium tin oxide (ITO). SHI stated that the new method also offers key improvements in mass production and cost efficiency compared with chemical deposition methods. It noted that SnO2 films can be deposited at more than 200 times the speed of current approaches, and ETL manufacturing costs are expected to fall to less than 0.5% of the conventional process, which typically involves depositing a fullerene (C60) layer followed by chemical vapor deposition of SnO2. The company said it aims to accelerate perovskite solar cell adoption by applying this methodology to mass production, in line with the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry's (METI) plans to deploy20 GW of perovskite solar capacityby 2040. METI has said that its 2040 perovskite target is part of broader plans to accelerate the adoption ofnext-generation solar technologies. In January 2025, Sekisui Chemical launched pilotperovskite solar projectsat two MUFG Bank sites in Japan to demonstrate the technology's durability and suitability for urban applications. A month later, a Japanese consortium of electronics supplier Macnica, thin-film PV manufacturer Reiko, and perovskite solar specialist Peccell Technologies began testing lightweight,flexible perovskite solar modulesat a pier in Yokohama. And in April, Japanese scientists achieved a record 26.5% efficiency in aflexible perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell, marking a significant advancement in high-performance, bendable photovoltaic technology.

The Spanish consultancy noted average price increases across the Belgian, British, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Nordic, Portuguese and Spanish electricity markets compared with the prior week. Weekly averages exceeded €75 ($86.99)/MWh in all analyzed markets except the Nordic market at €28.00/MWh and France at €66.34/MWh. The Italian market recorded the highest average of the week, at €113.27/MWh. AleaSoft said the upward trend was caused by higher electricity demand across most markets, which in turn was attributed to a rise in average temperatures across all analyzed countries. The consultancy forecast electricity demand to decline this week, leading to lower electricity prices across most markets. Wind energy production is expected to rise, affecting selected markets. In France and Germany, the average electricity price increased last week despite solar energy production rising by 13% and 8% week on week, respectively. Both markets reached new all-time highs for daily solar energy production during a single day in August last week. The German market generated 437 GWh and the French market 155 GWh on Aug. 11. AleaSoft said it expects solar energy production to fall in Germany and Italy this week but increase in Spain. This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

Shes says ender bias affects everything from research funding and journal reviews to hiring and promotion. “It also influences our own career choices, shaped by societal expectations about roles in domestic work, childcare, and leadership,” she states. Image: University of Southern Denmark Of the 8,233,028,358 people living on this planet today, 49.8% are female. There are no intellectual, medical, or other limitations that objectively restrict 49.8% of the population from taking part in all the activities the other 50.2% do. Studies consistently show that women are just as capable as men in developing specialized skills in science. So, if a large majority of males are still preferred in certain fields, whether solar energy or any other area with a large gender disparity, it means we are actively shrinking the talent pool. And that affects the whole industry. If gender equality were fulfilled, we would have access to a much larger and more diverse group of highly qualified professionals. That would naturally raise the quality and reach of our scientific and technological development. A musical piece consists of many different sounds, rhythms, and instruments. A painting displays a multitude of brushstrokes in all kinds of colors and forms. A novel contains countless words woven into meaning. Diversity is what creates richness, everywhere. STEM is no different. By working together, people with different backgrounds, viewpoints, skills, and ways of thinking can come up with faster, more innovative solutions. It’s the variety that leads to resilience and creativity. Looking back on my own journey in science, I faced challenges that many women still encounter today. Academic careers are tough. You’re expected to perform well in research, secure grants, contribute to projects, and teach, all within short timelines. This requires structure, and it takes time to build. But beyond the demands of the job, there’s another layer for women: the ongoing battle with gender bias and the societal constructs that try to shape us into “cute pink fluffy creatures from Venus” who enjoy baking and childcare, but supposedly can't handle strategic thinking or technical problem-solving. The truth is, the biggest challenge in life isn’t just work, it’s balance. Trying to build a career while maintaining health, family, finances, personal growth, and—once in a while, enjoying life is already difficult. But when you add in the burden of bias, it becomes a constant uphill climb. There’s no easy recipe. But for me, the only way has been to go past the barriers: crawl, climb, or jump over them—just keep your eyes on the goal and keep going. Mentorship has had a profound impact on my path. Just as we learn from our parents as children, we need mentors in our professional lives, people who guide us and open doors. I was fortunate to have a strong, loving, smart, and progressive woman as my mother. She always opened new windows to the world for me. She taught me discipline, persistence, and the importance of believing in myself. She continues to be my inspiration. I also believe we need to increase the visibility of female professionals in STEM. The more women we see leading and contributing in these roles, the more young girls will believe it’s possible for them too. Creating networks of women who offer direct mentorship to the younger generation is something I see as both powerful and necessary. But we need structural change, too. Women still hold only 11% of academic leadership positions in Europe, and only 3% of Nobel prizes in science have ever been awarded to women. That should speak volumes. Gender bias affects everything from research funding and journal reviews to hiring and promotion. It also influences our own career choices, shaped by societal expectations about roles in domestic work, childcare, and leadership. The good news is, I’ve seen a shift. These issues are finally getting more attention across media, academia, and broader society. That gives me hope. It means that future generations of young women may not have to face the same invisible ceilings we have. But we have to keep pushing for change. At the root of it, men and women are alike in personality, cognitive ability, and leadership. A 2005 analysis by Shibley Hyde of 46 psychological meta-analyses confirms this. So when we see different career outcomes between the genders, it’s not about capability, it’s about bias. As van den Besselaar and colleagues showed in a 2016 study, these biases steer even equally educated and talented individuals onto divergent paths. This divergence reinforces the stereotypes, which in turn shape the next generation’s decisions. If we want real equality, we must start early. We need to instill the idea that all humans, regardless of gender, race, nationality, or religion, are equal. And we must build legislative and institutional frameworks that support this vision, allowing it to take root and grow in society. To young women curious about science or considering a career in the renewable energy transition: If you care about something, go for it. Don’t listen to the discouraging or disbelieving voices; they’re not worth your time. Keep your eyes on your goal and take slow, steady steps toward it. And if you fail? That’s okay. Failure is part of growth. Each one is a lesson that prepares you for the next step. Learn from it, and never give up! Vida Engmann is an associate professor at SDU CAPE.

A strong jet stream brought record-breaking rainfall and suppressed irradiance across eastern Australia this winter, while stable high pressure in the Tasman Sea allowed southern regions – especially South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania – to outperform climatological averages. According to analysis using theSolcast API, most of New South Wales and coastal Queensland recorded negative irradiance anomalies for the season, while Tasmania and southern Victoria saw significant solar gains. New South Wales and coastal Queensland began winter on a positive note, with irradiance levels around 20% above average in June. However, this early boost was quickly eroded as atmospheric conditions reversed. July saw irradiance drop by around 20%, and in August, anomalies will reach -30% across large parts of the region. For the winter season, these declines will result in a net irradiance deficit close to 20% below climatology. While the Bureau of Meteorology’s seasonal outlook had forecast warmer-than-average temperatures and above-average rainfall primarily for Australia’s interior, the actual pattern was far more extreme on the east coast. Daytime temperatures remained slightly above average, but night-time lows were cooler than expected. Rainfall was especially heavy, with Sydney recording its wettest year to date and August delivering record rainfall totals across New South Wales. This excess rainfall and cloudiness are consistent with elevated sea surface temperatures, which also supported a persistent high-pressure system in the lower Tasman Sea. This continually drove moisture onshore, as seen from the satellite imagery from mid-August showing heavy cloud cover over NSW and clearer skies over South Australia. By contrast, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia experienced a continuation of autumn’s favourable irradiance conditions. Tasmania recorded anomalies of up to +20%, while parts of Victoria exceeded +30% in August alone. The mid-latitude westerlies were displaced further south, allowing fewer cold fronts to reach the region. At the same time, stronger-than-usual pre-frontal northerly winds brought in dry continental air, suppressing cloud formation and boosting irradiance. Adelaide, Hobart and Melbourne all outperformed historical averages for winter irradiance, significantly driven by sunny conditions in August. In the north and west, solar conditions were more mixed. The Northern Territory and northern Western Australia generally saw irradiance 10% above average. Western Australia began the season strongly, echoing the east coast’s sunny June, but August brought a turnaround. Much of WA ended winter with irradiance anomalies 20% below normal, particularly in the southwest. Similar to the eastern states, elevated sea surface temperatures likely contributed to higher rainfall and cloud cover during the latter part of the season. Solcastproduces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietaryAI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 350 companies managing over 300 GW of solar assets globally.

The proposed approach reportedly reduces device handling, time, and consequently financial effort. A LED-based module solar simulator Image: Fraunhofer ISE, Progress in Photovoltaics, CC BY 4.0 Researchers from Germany'sFraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems(Fraunhofer ISE) have developed a newprocedure for the precise and traceable spectral adjustment of LED-based solar simulators for measurements of large-area perovskite-silicon tandem solar modules. “We showed,for the first time, how a complete calibration of large-area perovskite on silicon tandem solar cell modules can be carried out by consistently using the spectral variability of LED-based solar simulators,” the research's lead author, David Chojniak, toldpv magazine. “Carrying out external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements, power measurements, determination of temperature coefficients, as well as investigations of module performances under variable spectral conditions at a single measurement, the setup provides an enormous potential for the establishment of tandem calibrations with LED-based solar simulators,” he added. In the study “Traceable Efficiency Determination of Large-Area Perovskite on Silicon Tandem Modules—Insights From a Calibration Laboratories Perspective,” published inProgress in Photovoltaics,Chojniakand his colleagues explained that the proposed procedure can be carried out on a single measurement setup for full module calibration, while involving full module EQE measurement based on the narrow emission spectra of the different LED types used in the setup. For their experiments, they used a Wavelabs SINUS-3000 Advanced LED-based solar simulator equipped with 26 spectrally different light sources. It was controlled using the in-house LabVIEW software. “The distance between the solar simulator and the device under test (DUT) was 7 m,” the paper reads. “The size of the illuminated area was 2.86 m2, for which a mean spectral nonuniformity of 0.95% was reached. “The simulator was set up in a temperature-controlled laboratory that was painted in black to reduce reflections.” The research team also looked into how the limited resolution and accuracy of the LED EQE affect the spectral adjustment of the solar simulator. The analysis showed that the new procedure offers “good qualitative” agreement with EQE measurements with the LED setup conducted on large-area modules and encapsulated cells at Fraunhofer ISE's CalLab PV Cells. The academics also adjusted the spectrum of LED-based solar simulators for the measurements of tandem cells and modules in accordance with the IEC60904-1-1 standard. , which describes procedures for the measurement of the current-voltage characteristics of multi-junction photovoltaic devices. “This procedure for fine-tuning the simulator's spectrum relies on making only minimal changes to its shape, eliminating the need to recalculate spectral mismatch (SMM) factors, and therefore avoids an iterative and time-consuming adjustment process,” the researchers pointed out. “The proposed procedure considerably reduces device handling, time, and consequently financial effort,” concludedChojniak.

Riyadh-basedACWA Powerhas received commercial operation certifications for three large-scale solar projects inSaudi Arabia. According to the company’slistingon Saudi exchange platform Tadawul, each certificate was received via project companies responsible for each individual project. The first certificate covers 1 GW of the 2 GW ArRass2 PV project located in the Qassim region of central Saudi Arabia, issued to project company Nawwar Renewable Energy Co. Meanwhile, the SAAD 2 PV project company, responsible for the SAAD 2 Solar PV project, has been granted its second commercial operation certificate covering 365.7 MW, taking the project to its full operating capacity of 1,125 MW. The certifications are rounded of by an initial commercial operation certificate issued to project company Ishaa Renewable Energy Co. for the full capacity of the 1,425 MW Al Kahfa Solar PV project located in Hail, northwestern Saudi Arabia. The three newly issued certificates have a combined capacity of 2.79 GW. ACWA Power holds a 50.1% stake in each of the three project companies. Under each filing, ACWA Power said it expects the financial impact of the commercial operation certificates to be reflected during the second half of the year. In July, Saudi Power Procurement Co. signed seven renewable energy PPAs with consortia led by ACWA Power, includingfive solar agreements, for a total 15 GW, marking the largest renewable energy capacity signed for in a single phase globally. In September 2024, ACWA Power secured $2.6 billion through a consortium of banks for three solar plants in Saudi Arabia, with a combined capacity of5.5 GW. Saudi Arabia has set a target of achieving 50% renewable energy in its energy mix by the end of the decade. The country’s cumulative solar capacity surpassed 4.2 GW by the end of 2024, according to figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Earlier this week, a consortium of Masdar, GD Power and Korea Electric Power Corp. reachedfinancial closeon the 2 GW Al Sadawi solar project in Saudi Arabia.

The new community batteries have been launched on Phillip Island, located to the south of the state capital, Melbourne, and in the small town of Merland, in the Central Highlands region of Queensland. Six out of seven community batteries have been installed on Phillip Island in Victoria thus far. These battery energy storage systems (BESS) total 900kW/1,845kWh across seven locations on the island, including Cowes and Wimbledon Heights. The batteries are a joint project between Mondo Energy, the commercial arm of network operator AusNet, the Bass Coast Shire Council and Totally Renewable Phillip Island. The Victoria government has confirmed that the community batteries have been delivered as part of its 100 Neighbourhood Batteries Program. This initiative aims to empower communities in Victoria to benefit from rooftop solar PV without requiring individual home battery systems. Through the Neighbourhood Battery Initiative grant programme, the Victorian state government is offering up to AU$400,000 (US$257,095) per project to applicants who can demonstrate multi-use case applications for BESS. Thethird round of this programme launched in July 2025, with AU$6.6 million earmarked for the technology across the state. The initiative covers systems that include a neighbourhood battery, solar PV, a generator, and a management system. Each battery must be a minimum of 20kW/40kWh and a maximum of 5MW/20MWh. Meanwhile, in Queensland, state-owned energy company Energy Queensland has switched on a new 4MW/8MWh community battery in the town of Emerald. According to the Queensland government statement, the community battery is designed to capture the distributed rooftop solar PV systems located across the town. This amounts to around 18.4MW of generation capacity and roughly 28% of the community. Energy Queensland is currently constructing or energizing a new unit in its fleet of 30 local network-connected batteries across the state. These batteries will be utilized for network support, and any excess capacity will be shared with a retailer to trade on the National Electricity Market (NEM). This arrangement aims to maximise the benefits of the battery by reducing both network and wholesale costs. According to the state government, 18 community batteries have already been energised around the State, and 12 more are under construction and on track to be completed this financial year. Queensland’s treasurer and minister for energy, David Janetzki, said increasing the amount of energy in the market would put downward pressure on power prices. “This battery in Emerald is playing a key role in supporting Ergon Energy’s networks to gain the maximum advantage from Queensland’s abundant rooftop solar systems,” Janetzki said. “Each battery enables renewable energy to be stored locally and can support up to 500 homes in the evening peak load period, making better use of locally generated solar power when the sun goes down.” Last week, state-owned utilityWestern Power commissioned five new community batteries in Perth suburbsas part of a federally funded initiative in Western Australia. The organisation confirmed that five community BESS, each 500kW/2,800kWh, have been installed in the suburbs of Coogee, Kinross, Bayswater, Stratton and Port Kennedy.

According to AEMO’s new2025 Electricity Statement of Opportunitiesreport, battery energy storage systems demonstrate the highest reliability, with approximately 70% of the NEM’s fleet having experienced unplanned outage rates of only 0-5%. It adds that longer-duration storage, defined as 4-hours or more, is more effective at reducing reliability risks than shorter-duration storage. This is because in 2030-31, expected USE in South Australia is forecast to exceed the reliability standard, with some shortfall events lasting more than four hours. In such conditions, AEMO said 2-hour battery storage systems are typically exhausted early, providing no reliability benefits for later hours of the forecast USE event. By contrast, longer duration storage can sustain output over a larger portion or even across the full duration of these USE events. Energy storage continues to emerge as a critical component of Australia’s energy transition strategy. AEMO’s report reveals various storage durations and their effectiveness in meeting reliability standards, providing crucial insights for developers and policymakers. Indeed, several different technology combinations in South Australia could be sought to help reduce expected unserved energy (USE) and meet reliability standards by 2030-31. For instance, AEMO states that 820MW of 2-hour storage would be required to reduce expected USE to meet the reliability standard. In contrast, less than half that capacity is needed if the storage has a duration of 4-hours or more – specifically, 365MW of 4-hour storage would suffice. The report also demonstrates that longer-duration storage options could provide increasingly efficient solutions: 6-hour duration storage, for example, would require 320MW. In contrast, 8-hour storage would need approximately 315MW to achieve the same reliability outcomes. According to AEMO, hybrid configurations show even greater efficiency gains. When wind is combined with 4-hour duration energy storage, the requirement drops to 295MW of storage co-located with 590MW of wind generation. Similarly, solar PV combined with 4-hour storage would require 285MW of energy storage alongside 570MW of solar. The most efficient configuration examined involves a combination of wind, solar and 4-hour storage, requiring 280MW of storage, 555MW of wind and 140MW of solar.

Energy Vault is partnering with Turkey’s Astor Enerji, Richardson is expanding in Illinois, and Fluence is manufacturing HVAC and chiller equipment in Texas. These moves followEnergy-Storage.news’last roundup, which sawthree companies announce plans to begin domestically manufacturing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells in the US. US grid-scale energy storage solutions provider Energy Vault and Turkey-based transformer manufacturer Astor Enerji have signed a global strategic agreement to strengthen global supply chains for battery energy storage systems (BESS). The agreement will see Energy Vault supplying its B-Vault BESS for Astor Enerji’s four grid-connected PV projects in Romania, for a combined capacity of 2GWh. The projects will also utilise the company’s energy management system (EMS), VaultOS. Astor Enerji, meanwhile, will provide transformers and high-voltage equipment for more than 1GW of Energy Vault BESS projects in the US, Australia and Europe. Energy Vault notes that US transformer wait times have stretched from 50 weeks to as long as 127 weeks, emphasising that the agreement with Astor Enrji will provide the company with access to high-quality equipment from a non-foreign entity of concern (FEOC) designated nation. Energy Vault’s BESS projects are being developed and operated through its wholly owned subsidiary, Asset Vault, which is backed by a US$300 million preferred equity investment announced on 7 August. The supply chain of transformers has been tightening for some time. At the 2023 RE+ trade show in Las Vegas,system integrators and engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractors shared how lead times for the equipment had extended from 12 months to 32-36 months, plus time for the procurement cycle. Energy Vault has also been active in development,closing a US$18 million financing in July for its 57MW/114MWh Cross Trails BESS in Scurry County, Texas. Later this quarter, the company expects to receive over US$12 million in investment tax credit (ITC) funds as part of a previously agreed ITC sale agreement. Marco Terruzzin, Chief Revenue Officer at Energy Vault, said of the partnership with Astor Enerji, “Together, we are building the technology and supply chain capacity to meet surging power demand from AI data centres and the rapid adoption of renewable energy. This is how we deliver power abundance and economic growth on a global scale.” Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) and Richardson Electronics announced on 20 August that Richardson will expand its manufacturing headquarters in La Fox, Illinois. Richardson manufactures green energy products, power and grid and microwave tubes and more. With the support of the Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois (REV Illinois) programme, the company will make a capital investment of more than US$8.5 million over the next four years. Richardson Electronics will invest in equipment and structural upgrades in order to research, develop, and produce BESS at the company’s manufacturing facility. Notably, Richardson says its technology will demonstrate the viability of long-duration energy storage (LDES), and is being developed for manufacturing, healthcare and critical infrastructure operations. The company also says it will retain approximately 200 employees and create 54 full-time jobs. Richardson Electronics received a REV Illinois tax credit as part of the State’s incentive package, recognising the company’s capital investment and commitment to job creation. The agreement also outlines the retention of 190 jobs throughout the entire agreement period. In 2023, Pritzker welcomed Gotion High-Tech, a China-headquartered manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries, to the state. The company is establishing a split production facility in Illinois. In March of this year, Illinois State Senator Bill Cunningham and Representative Marcus Evans introduced a bill, HB3758, to reduce energy bills and set a 15GW energy storage deployment target. HB3758 shares many similarities with Senate Bill 3997 (SB3997),introduced by Cunningham in January, which aimed to accelerate energy storage in Illinois. Both bills seem to be at a standstill. SB3997 was adjourned without a set meeting date in January, and HB3758 was re-referred to the rules committee in March. BESS integrator Fluence, in partnership with climate control specialist Bergstrom, has started production of thermal management systems, including HVAC and chiller equipment, at a new manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas. The HVAC and chiller equipment will be used for Fluence’s Gridstack Pro BESS solution. Fluence says the Houston facility “plays a crucial role in the company’s strategy to onshore production of every major product and component of a grid-BESS to the United States.” While increasing US manufacturing of BESS materials has been an ongoing goal for some time, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) andForeign Entity of Concern (FEOC)requirements have made it an ever-present issue for companies like Fluence. As per the company’s statement, it utilises five manufacturing facilities in partnership with US-based manufacturers to produce a range of products, including battery cells, modules, inverters, enclosures, and control equipment. These collaborations account for over 1,200 manufacturing jobs in 2025. As reported yesterday (21 August), byEnergy-Storage.news,Fluence, along with ACE Engineering, just opened a new automated battery storage manufacturing facility in Vietnam’s Bac Giang Province. Fluence’s new facility has an annual manufacturing capacity of 35GWh, producing Gridstack Pro and Smartstack energy storage systems using fully automated production processes. This follows other companies, such as Chinese battery and BESS manufacturer, CATL, moving manufacturing capacity to Southeast Asia.CATL broke ground on its battery manufacturing facility in West Java, Indonesia, in July. Fluencealso recently shared its financial results for Q3 2025, reporting a quarterly revenue of US$602.5 million, up 24.7% year-on-year from US$483 million. According to the company’s latest results, delays in ramping up domestic manufacturing capabilities will push back the generation of approximately US$100 million in revenue until early next year. The company stated it experienced “some typical ramp-up issues” putting in place its Arizona production lines. Speaking on the Houston facility, Peter Williams, Fluence’s Chief Product and Supply Chain Officer, said, “This expansion helps accelerate our progress toward increasing US-based production and strengthening a resilient supply chain, and we believe it positions us to maximise domestic content in the solutions we deliver.”", "relevance_reason": "Найдено 3 ключевых слов"}, "channel_id": "-1002996332660"}, "ed14060ed41bc4e2": {"message_id": null, "news_data": {"title": "Iberdrola hires Ingeteam for 100MW/200MWh BESS hybridisation of PV plants in Spain", "url": "https://www.energy-storage.news/iberdrola-hires-ingeteam-for-100mw-200mwh-bess-hybridisation-of-pv-plants-in-spain/", "date": "2025-08-22 08:14", "source": "Energy Storage News", "preview": "Iberdrola hires Ingeteam for 100MW/200MWh BESS hybridisation of PV plants in Spain Spanish utility Iberdrola and power conversion specialist firm Ingeteam have partnered to hybridise Spanish operational PV plants with battery energy storage systems (BESS).

In total, four solar PV plants – in the provinces of Burgos, Huelva and the autonomous region of Extremadura – will be co-located with BESS with a total of 100MW/200MWh. Each project will consist of five medium-voltage stations that manage 25MW/50MWh BESS. The aim of hybridising BESS at the operational solar PV plants is to improve the management of the renewable energy. The storage systems supplied by Ingeteam include a proprietary hybrid power plant controller (H-PPC) coordinated with the PV plant and combines and limits the power delivered at the point of connection. Moreover, Ingeteam will supply its medium-voltage power electronics solution, control electronics, and SCADA monitoring system, which will manage the PV plants along with the new BESS plants. According to Ingeteam, the projects were awarded more than €26 million (US$30 million) in funding from the Spanish Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (IDAE), as they were recognised as Strategic Projects for Economic Recovery and Transformation (PERTE). These projectscould be part of the up to 150MW/300MWh BESS expected to be co-located with solar PVthat the utility secured funding for last year from the PERTE tender. Co-locating BESS with solar PV and renewable energy in general has become a priority in Spain after the countrywas affected by a blackout in Aprilof this year, as covered by our sister-sitePV Tech. Two months after the event, the government had approved – through a royal-decree subject to a vote in the Congress of Deputies – several measures to improve the country’s grid, including a faster administrative process to hybridise energy storage with renewables. Although the reformsended up being rejected by the Spanish Congressof Deputies last month, the Spanish government proposed a new royal decree that still aims to facilitate the co-location of BESS with renewables. A broader coverage of the Iberian blackout and its impact on solar PV was featured in the latest edition of our journalPV Tech Power, which isavailable herefor our Premium subscribers. Spain’s National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) targets around 22.5GW of energy storage by 2030, and interest in the technology has been growing in recent months. The Spanish Ministry of Environmentlaunched a financial support scheme for energy storagein June of this year, aimed at supporting the development of up to 3.5GW of projects. A total of €700 million (US$812 million) is available in the form of capex grants. “Spain is one of the most promising markets for the development of energy storage in Europe. The combination of PV with BESS not only allows for the optimal use of clean energy, but also improves the security and stability of supply,” said Katarzyna Suchcicka, VP of the management board at independent power producer R.Power, which has a BESS project portfolio of 344MW in Spain, of which 222MW are in standalone installations. More recently, thefirst solar-plus-storage power purchase agreement (PPA) in Spainwas signed between Spanish energy firm Zelestra and Portuguese utility EDP. Zelestra will build a 170MWp/400MWh solar-plus-project in the western region of Extremadura. This is not the first collaboration between Ingeteam and Iberdrola, as both companies previously partnered in the hybridisation of renewable energies with BESS, including the installation of the first BESS with an operational wind farm in Spain, said Ingeteam. The companies also collaborated in a green hydrogen project in 2022, with Ingeteamsupplying BESS for the Puertollano facility.", "relevance_reason": "Найдено 5 ключевых слов"}, "channel_id": "-1002996332660"}, "d2002d7e6053ca4d": {"message_id": null, "news_data": {"title": "State-owned utility commissions five new community batteries in Western Australia", "url": "https://www.energy-storage.news/state-owned-utility-commissions-five-new-community-batteries-in-western-australia/", "date": "2025-08-22 02:43", "source": "Energy Storage News", "preview": "State-owned utility commissions five new community batteries in Western Australia State-owned utility Western Power has commissioned five new community batteries in Perth suburbs as part of a federally funded initiative in Western Australia.

The organisation confirmed that five community battery energy storage systems (BESS), each 500kW/2,800kWh, have been installed in the suburbs of Coogee, Kinross, Bayswater, Stratton and Port Kennedy. The Coogee community BESS is already operational, whilst Kinross, Bayswater and Stratton will be operational “shortly”. Construction at Port Kennedy is expected to begin shortly. These will service approximately 350 households, including renters and apartment dwellers who typically cannot install rooftop solar PV and storage systems. Connected households can save up to AU$132 (US$84) annually, together with a 4kWh off-peak offset under a retail subscription product being developed by Synergy, another state-owned energy company, for release later in the year. The lithium-ion battery systems are connected directly to the local distribution network, allowing them to store excess solar energy generated by households in each neighbourhood. This stored energy can then be discharged during peak demand periods, providing multiple benefits to both the grid and local residents. Western Power selected the five locations based on several factors, including the concentration of rooftop solar installations in each area and specific network requirements. The organisation added that the placement of these batteries aims to maximise their effectiveness in addressing local grid constraints while providing energy storage access to the greatest number of households. Sam Barbaro, CEO of Western Power, took to LinkedIn to celebrate the launch of the new community batteries, stating they are a “win-win for Western Power and customers.” “Currently, 40% of homes in the Western Power network have rooftop solar, and projects like this will enable a higher uptake of rooftop solar in a sustainable way that supports system security and manages infrastructure costs,” Barbaro added. Western Power confirmed the initiative received AU$2.5 million in funding through thefederal government’s AU$200 million Community Batteries for Household Solar programme, which aims to install 400 community batteries nationwide to provide shared storage for households across Australia. In addition to the federal government’s community battery programme, the federal government has invested AU$20.8 million in Project Jupiter, which aims to help Western Australian households benefit from Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). The Western Australian state government, led by Premier Roger Cook, has also launched complementary initiatives, including theWA Residential Battery Schemethat opened in July 2025. This scheme combines the AU$337 million WA Household Battery Rebate with the federal government’sAU$2.3 billion Cheaper Home Batteries programmeto support 100,000 households installing residential battery systems. The five new installations add to Western Power’s growing portfolio of community batteries across the South West Interconnected System (SWIS). The utility has been at the forefront of community battery deployment in Australia, beginning with its first PowerBank trial in Meadow Springs, which launched in 2018 and featured a 105kW/420kWh BESS.

W...", "full_text": "What does Trump’s tax reconciliation bill mean for US solar and BESS project development and construction right now? We hear from developer-operator Agilitas Energy CEO Barrett Bilotta. The firm is primarily known for distributed solar and battery energy storage system (BESS) projects in the Northeastern US butrecently commissioned its first BESS in Texas, part of asix-project portfolio acquired in 2023. It’s a highly uncertain time for those deploying solar, BESS and other clean energy technologies in the US.Trump’s tax reconciliation bill (OBBB)brought in an early end to tax credits for solar and wind. While it left energy storage tax credit timelines largely the same,still-to-be-clarified foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions on technology procurementsignificantly increase the risk of buying from China. Bilotta explained that the uncertainty created byTrump’s China tariffs, for which another 90-day truce was announced this week, and FEOC restrictions on technology creates challenges for procurement and progressing projects, but not an insurmountable one. “We have a lot of projects and assets that are near-term/starting construction so we feel pretty comfortable about those assets making it through the window put in by OBBB,” Bilotta said. “As an industry there are now a lot of problems for greenfield development, primarily because a bunch of the economics worked when you had tax credits for further-out projects: taking away that tax credit puts things into flux.” “As an industry, it will still go ahead and continue, but it will reset a bunch of programmes, increase electricity prices, or something else that will make things pencil out. A lot of that will boil down to higher PPA pricing for offtakers.” “There will be cost compression, because there will be less demand for construction and less demand for modules and inverters, so pricing will come down on supply side to move components.” “Everything that was a threshold project will be scrapped.” The future of BESS is closely tied to the future of solar and wind, whose variable generation is the primary demand driver for the flexibility and load-shifting services BESS generates much of its revenue from. Bilotta points to the past history of solar as a cause for optimism despite the OBBB’s early sunset of tax credits. “The market will mature more. The first maturation with solar happened with interest rates increasing after the zero-rate phenomenon. Solar suddenly needed to make the numbers work with real interest rates,” he said. “Solar projects will work but there’ll be a rejigging of the market, with states changing the types of direct subsidies, PPA buyers paying more etc.” The big question mark for energy storage is the FEOC component. For any project that didn’t start construction before 2025, tax credits will be denied if they rely too heavily on equipment from China. The same will happen if they depend on Chinese investments, pay Chinese counterparts via contracts of technology licenses. That’s a problem because most of the supply chain for batteries and BESS is in China. The US Treasury was scheduled to provide guidance on FEOC rules by 18 August. Many had doubted it would happen within that time frame, and the industry still awaits the guidance with baited breath. “From the energy storage side, we’re now just awaiting FEOC guidelines,” Bilotta said. “Our EPC team is dealing with a variety of manufacturers, switching around manufacturers. Now, if you are going to develop-build, you really need in-house expertise; you have to know what equipment works.” “We are trying to make the most rigid standard as it relates to compliance with FEOC, to meet that standard with those assets.” “If just one component is from a friendly nation like South Korea, will that hit threshold? If you buy an integrated system like Sungrow, it sounds like that wont qualify unless they totally shift their supply chain. All we can do is triage the risk.” It’s well-understood how you build solar with domestic procurement, but not so for clear for BESS which has much less capacity, Bilotta said. “Some might have more confidence about that capacity. We as a company don’t have the time pressure to make a decision. That is a luxury; others have live bullets flying.” One silver lining of all this for energy storage Barett sees is that the economic case for it may actually get stronger. We said earlier that the future of energy storage is closely tied to wind and solar, but Bilotta posits on the other hand that a slowdown in their deployment could converge with continued electricity demand growth to increase the need for energy storage. “Big energy users, states, businesses, all these things will require more energy services. The revenue side of the equation will change,” Bilotta said. “But this will depend on the buildout of EV charging and data centres.” We also discussed the company’s recent move into hydropower, with the acquisition of projects in West Virginia and Maryland totalling 44MW from Advanced Hydro Solutions, expected to be operational on the PJM grid by 2028. “We’ve been looking at hydro as an asset class for a while and the sector got a big shot in the arm with the IRA extending the tax credits to it,” Bilotta said. “Both projects get a 50% tax credit.” “There’s a huge demand for power, especially baseload, and it’s a stable asset so attractive for utilities and data centres. These projects are on federally-owned dams so that reduces the risk substantially.” “Construction is very different to solar and wind. You’re working on existing operational dams which are much more complicated. The actual units and turbines are a relatively small cost, most of the cost is building the pumphouse, temporary dams. We self-perform EPC for solar and storage, but for this we’d hire a large-scale experienced general contractor.”", "relevance_reason": "Найдено 3 ключевых слов"}, "channel_id": "-1002996332660"}, "c8d0e42bcc7e9f16": {"message_id": null, "news_data": {"title": "Statera brings online UK’s biggest battery storage project to date", "url": "https://www.energy-storage.news/statera-brings-online-uks-biggest-battery-storage-project-to-date/", "date": "2025-08-21 09:27", "source": "Energy Storage News", "preview": "Statera brings online UK’s biggest battery storage project to date Statera Energy has begun operating the biggest BESS project in the UK, connected to a National Grid substation that formerly supported two coal power plants.

The developer announced earlier this week (18 August) that its 300MW/600MWh Thurrock Storage battery energy storage system (BESS) project in Essex, Southeast England, is delivering energy to the grid. Originally planned as a 1-hour duration project, the 2-hour BESS asset is part of Thurrock Flexible Generation, a complex that will also feature a co-located 450MW flexible generation gas-fired thermal power plant. National Grid connected Thurrock Storage to its Tilbury substation just south of the project site, noting that the transmission infrastructure formerly served to connect the now-retired Tilbury A and Tilbury B coal-fired power plants to the grid. National Grid said work is underway to connect the site’s gas-fired generation to the grid. Statera claimed the combination of batteries and gas generation at one site enables Thurrock Flexible Generation to respond to fluctuations in supply and demand created by the addition of solar PV and wind for extended periods of shortfall. Statera specialises in flexible energy resources that can play a role in the low-carbon grid alongside renewables, claiming to have more than 2.1GW of projects in the UK already delivered or in construction, plus a further 16GW in development or consented, comprising batteries, pumped hydro energy storage (PHES), hydrogen and flexible generation technologies. Statera’s claim that Thurrock Storage is the UK’s largest operational BESS facility rings true. However, several projects are in construction or development, which will likely take over the unofficial title soon. These include a number by Statera itself. In fact, according to Solar Media Market Research analyst Josh Cornes, whose team publishes theBattery Storage: UK Pipeline & Completed Assets Database, with Thurrock Storage now online, three out of the six largest grid-scale battery storage projects in the UK have been built by the developer. Before Thurrock Storage, the largest to date in the country was developer-investorZenobe Energy’s Blackhillock 200MW/400MWh grid-forming BESS, between Inverness and Aberdeen in Scotland, announced as operational in February, Cornes said. Looking further ahead, four 1GW or larger UK projects with planning approval in place are awaiting construction, including the 1.4GW Thorpe Marsh project by Onpath Energy, approved in January 2025, Innova’s 1,025MW Almhome Energy Hub, and others. Cornes also confirmed that with no other significant renewable or flexibility resources connected at the Tilbury substation, but with 800MW of solar PV operational near the Essex site with 1.7GW under construction or at the ready-to-build stage, Statera’s claim of picking a strategically significant location also rings true.
