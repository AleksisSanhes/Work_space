Уже состоялось девять аукционов, проведенных индийской государственной корпорацией солнечной энергии (SECI). Ранееотмечалось, что их результаты свидетельствуют о конкурентоспособности зеленого аммиака – цены лишь немного выше нынешних цен на «серый» аммиак. По итогам девятого конкурсного отбора победителем стала индийская компания ACME, предложившая рекордно низкую цену49,75 рупий (0,568 доллара США) за килограмм аммиака. Это уже четвертая победа ACME. В июле компаниявыигралапервый из серии аукционов, предложив у 55,75 индийских рупий (0,64 доллара США) /кг для поставки 75 тысяч метрических тонн зеленого аммиака в год индийскому производителю удобрений Paradeep Phosphates Limited в течение 10 лет. В этот раз по условиям тендера ACME будет поставлять 100 тысяч тонн NH3 в год на объект Индийского фермерского кооператива удобрений (IFFCO) в Парадипе, штат Одиша. Установленная цена составляет примерно 568 долларов США за тонну, при этом цена на серый аммиак в Индии — около 515 долларов США за тонну. Разница небольшая, и с учетом того, что цена на зеленый аммиак фиксирована на длительный срок, условия договора выглядят конкурентоспособными. SECI заявила, что проведенные тендеры «укрепили доверие, обострили конкуренцию и обеспечили конкурентоспособные по мировым меркам цены». В августе 2021 года премьер-министр Индии Нарендра Модиобъявило запуске «Национальной водородной миссии» (National Green Hydrogen Mission) с целью сделать Индию «глобальным центром производства, потребления и экспорта зеленого водорода и его производных». Миссия нацелена на производство 5 миллионов тонн зеленого водорода к 2030 году и связанное с этим развитие мощностей возобновляемой энергетики. В феврале 2022 года Индия опубликовалаполитикув области зеленого водорода / зеленого аммиака (Green Hydrogen/ Green Ammonia Policy). В рамках Миссии правительство Индии сформировало набор стимулов для «перехода на зеленый водород» — Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT). Набор включает в себя предоставление субсидий на производство электролизеров и зеленого водорода внутри страны. В 2023 году ACMEанонсировалаинвестиции в размере 270 миллиардов рупий (3,3 миллиарда долларов США) в проект завода по производству зеленого водорода и аммиака в штате Одиша на востоке Индии. Полная мощность предприятия составит 1,3 миллиона тонн зеленого аммиака в год. В 2024 году ACMEподписаласоглашение с японской промышленной группой IHI на предмет продажи 400000 тонн «зеленого» аммиака в год, начиная с 2028 года. Использование зеленого аммиака для производства удобрений — актуальная тема. В 2024 году норвежская Yaraоткрылазавод по производству зелёного водорода (крупнейший в Европе на то время), который будет использоваться для производства аммиака.

Сегодня Gentari сообщила о заключении соглашения со строительной и инжиниринговой фирмой Gamuda на предмет реализации проектов солнечной энергетики общей мощностью 1,5 гигаватт (ГВт) для снабжения электроэнергией крупномасштабных центров обработки данных (ЦОД) в рамках малазийской национальной Программы поставок возобновляемой электроэнергии предприятиям (CRESS). Солнечные электростанции будут также оснащаться системами накопления энергии (батареи), размеры которых не указываются. Программа CRESS позволяет компаниям закупать ВИЭ-электроэнергию непосредственно у генераторов с поставкой через национальную сеть. В совместном заявлении компаний отмечается, что они будут способствовать удовлетворению «неотложной необходимости» расширения мощностей ВИЭ для удовлетворения растущего спроса на электроэнергию крупномасштабных центров обработки данных в Малайзии, который, как ожидается, достигнет 5 ГВт к 2035 году. Национальная дорожная карта энергетического перехода Малайзии (NETR) предусматривает увеличение доли возобновляемой энергетики в установленной мощности энергосистемы до 40% к 2035 году и до 70% к 2050 году. В маесообщалось, что Саудовская Аравия планирует инвестировать $10 млрд в возобновляемую энергетику Малайзии. Бум строительства центров обработки данных (ЦОД) ведет к росту потребления электроэнергии. В апреле Международное энергетическое агентство (МЭА) выпустило специальныйдоклад, посвященный влиянию ЦОД на энергетический сектор. В нём прогнозируется, что к 2030 году потребление электроэнергии центрами обработки данных в мире увеличится более чем в два раза и составит около 945 ТВт*ч. Во многих странах эти растущие потребности будут покрываться с помощью возобновляемых источников энергии. Например, по китайскимнормам, дата-центры в КНР должны получать 80% электроэнергии из возобновляемых источников. В июле в Китаереализованпервый проект прямого зеленого электроснабжения ЦОД.

Он является актуализациейпрогноза, опубликованного в начале года — с учетом данных о вводе мощностей за первые шесть месяцев. В первой половине 2025 года в Соединенных Штатах были введены в эксплуатацию крупномасштабные солнечные электростанции (СЭС) общей мощностью 12 гигаватт (ГВт), и энергетики планируют добавить еще 21 ГВт во второй половине года. В общей сумме это 33 ГВт, что даже несколько превышает февральский прогноз EIA. Особо подчеркнём, что здесь не включены объекты распределенной солнечной генерации, а это еще несколько гигаватт. Если все планы будут реализованы,на солнечную энергетику придется более половиныиз 64 ГВт мощностей электроэнергетики, которые энергокомпании планируют ввести в эксплуатацию в нынешнем году. 64 ГВт – это рекордный показатель годового ввода мощностей для США. Предыдущий рекорд был установлен в 2002 году, когда энергетики добавили в систему 58 ГВт, из которых 57 ГВт работали на природном газе. Около 27% (3,2 ГВт) от общей мощности солнечных электростанций, введенной в эксплуатацию за первые шесть месяцев 2025 года, приходится на Техас, и энергетики планируют ввести в эксплуатацию еще 9,7 ГВт СЭС в этом штате во второй половине года. В прошлом году Техас обогнал Калифорнию по мощности крупномасштабных СЭС. Второе место по размеру прироста мощностей в первом полугодии заняли системы накопления энергии (аккумуляторные батареи) – 5,9 ГВт или 26% общего прироста мощностей электроэнергии. Около половины этого объема пришлось на Аризону и Калифорнию. Энергетики в Техасе планируют ввести в эксплуатацию 7 ГВт накопителей в 2025 году, причем большая часть этой мощности будет введена во второй половине года. В целом по США регулятор ожидает добавления 18,3 ГВт систем накопления энергии за год, что практически соответствует прогнозу, данному в начале года. Если запланированное увеличение мощностей солнечных фотоэлектрических станций и накопителей состоится, обе технологии поставят рекорд по годовым объемам ввода новых объектов. Прирост мощностей ветроэнергетики ожидается на уровне 7,8 ГВт. Также в энергосистему планируется добавить 4,7 ГВт газовых электростанций. Таким образом, на генерацию на основе ископаемого топлива придется лишь 7,3% мощности, добавленной в США в 2025 году. При этом следует учитывать, что в текущем году планируется вывести из эксплуатации газовые ТЭС мощностью 1,6 ГВт, а также угольные мощностью 6,2 ГВт. То есть в стране отмечается сокращение генерирующих мощностей, работающих на основе ископаемого топлива, что свидетельствует о продолжении и усилении процессов декарбонизации энергетики США. Энергетическая политика (и, в большей степени, риторика) Дональда Трампа, направленная против ВИЭ, пока никак не отражается в энергетической статистике. Каких-либо изменений в направлениях развития электроэнергетики и не могло произойти за один год, поскольку инвестиционный цикл в отрасли много длиннее. Прекращение предоставления налоговых вычетов (tax credits) для проектов ВИЭ ожидается с 2028 года. Это ухудшит экономику новых проектов, хотя, принимая во внимание завышенные затраты (в США капитальные затраты на строительство СЭСв два раза выше, чем в Индии или Китае), разработчикам проектов есть куда ужиматься. Возможный запрет на строительство СЭС и ВЭС на сельхозземлях вряд ли сильно повлияет на отрасль, тем более федеральное правительство не имеет прямого контроля за реализацией энергетических проектов в частных владениях. Наконец, альтернатив «альтернативной», как она когда-то называлась, энергетике не так уж и много. Несмотря навторую попыткуТрампа спасти уголь, вряд ли найдется много инвесторов, готовых сегодня вкладываться в угольную генерацию. К слову, в 2024 годуветровые и солнечные электростанции впервые обошли(совместно) угольную генерацию по выработке (17,2% против 14,9%). В июле EIA сообщало, что СШАпланируютзакрыть угольные электростанции общей мощностью 27 ГВт до конца 2028.

В публикации показано, что выбросы в Китае сократились на 1% в годовом исчислении в первом полугодии 2025 года. При этом выбросы CO2 в энергетическом секторе страны, который является основным эмитентом выбросов,сократились более чем на 3%в первой половине года, поскольку рост только солнечной генерации «перекрыл» весь прирост потребления электроэнергии, который составил 3,7%. Использование угля в электроэнергетике Китая сократилось на 3,4% по сравнению с аналогичным периодом годом ранее, тогда как использование газа увеличилось на 6%, что привело к снижению выбросов в секторе в целомна 3,2%. Анализ Carbon Brief показывает, чторекордное увеличениемощностей солнечной энергетики позволит Китаю сократить выбросы CO2 за 2025 год в целом. Единственным крупным сектором, где наблюдался рост выбросов в первой половине года, стала химическая промышленность, а вот выбросы в секторе производства строительных материалов сократились на 3%. Однако даже если выбросы Китая сократятся в 2025 году, ему, скорее всего, не удастся достичь ряда важных климатических целей, включая цели по снижению интенсивности выбросов углерода (выбросов на единицу ВВП), контроль за ростом потребления угля и новыми мощностями угольных электростанций, а также увеличение доли стали, производимой в электродуговых печах, в общем объеме производства стали. Доля электродуговой стали в общем объеме производства снизилась с 10,2% в 2024 году до 9,8% в первой половине 2025 года, несмотря на целевой показатель правительства в 15% на этот год. Ожидается, что в текущем году мощности угольных электростанций резко возрастут, несмотря на сокращение спроса на электроэнергию, вырабатываемую за счёт угля. Государственная электросетевая компания прогнозирует прирост тепловой мощности в 127 ГВт. В том числе мощности угольных ТЭС могут вырасти на 80-100 ГВт. Напомню Китай официально стремитсядостичь пика выбросов углекислого газа до 2030 года иуглеродной нейтральности до 2060 года.

Uganda also has a special place in the history of boda bodas. That’s because, over 50 years ago,Ali Mayende’s innovation in the border town of Busia sparked a revolution that has become the lifeblood of East African public transport. As detailed in that article from African Arguments, Ali Mayende began ferrying passengers from Busia, a small town on the edges of Eastern Uganda, to the border with Kenya in the 1960s. Others followed, giving birth to the boda boda industry. Now a big phenomenon on the African continent, the motorcycle taxi industry is attracting huge attention and investment. These motorcycle taxis are the heartbeat of the passenger and small goods transport system in a lot of countries in Africa. Close to 30 million motorcycles on the continent are used in this motorcycle taxi industry. With almost 99% of them still being internal combustion engine motorcycles, there is a huge opportunity and a large addressable market for electrification. The move towards electric vehicles in Africa, especially in this electric motorcycle sector, has mainly been driven by the private sector by small startup companies. Most of the developments in Africa’s electric motorcycle sector have been concentrated along what is now known as the “boda belt.” The boda belt, a term coined by Tom Courtright, is a stretch of countries on the African map where motorcycle taxis have been prominent over the years. This belt stretches from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to the outskirts of Dakar, Senegal. There is also significant activity in North African countries such as Morocco, where smaller scooters are used mainly for personal transportation, unlike in East Africa and West Africa, where most of the activity is for commercial transport purposes. One of the pioneers in Africa’s electric motorcycle sector, fittingly, started in Uganda! I have been following developments in the African electric mobility sector for about a decade now and every time I get an update on what’s going on somewhere on the continent, I get so excited, as it gives us an insight into how much progress has been made over the past couple of decades. Having been on the ground and speaking with founders of hundreds of electric mobility startups and other firms all over the African continent, I always feel confident to say that the transition to electric mobility in Africa will happen a whole lot faster than most people realize. That’s because it has been developed by locally-based companies tackling real pain points and everyday problems faced by public operators and other stakeholders that make up their key target market — all developed from the ground up without much in terms of government subsidies like we’ve seen in other developed markets around the world. Uganda-basedZembowas one of the startups that kickstarted the electric motorcycle taxi revolution on the African continent. Zembo started with an initial pilot phase from 2017 to around 2020. Zembo then launched version 2.0 of its motorcycle and batteries from 2021, adding 30 swap stations. It is now working on expanding to over 2,000 active riders and over 80 battery charging and swap stations in 2025. We have a great update from Uganda on Zembo’s impact, a lovely example to show how far along the transition to electric is in Uganda.According to news coming from Uganda, Zembo’s electric motorcycles are contributing to record electrification numbers in the last-mile delivery sector for partners such as Glovo. Glovo recently celebrated a milestone of 5 years operating in Uganda. As part of the celebrations, Glovo opened a new headquarters in Kampala and highlighted that about 40% of Glovo’s couriers now ride electric and there are plans to raise this to even higher levels soon, which will have a big impact on their mission to reduce emissions. Already, Zembo’s fleet in general (including riders outside the partnership with Glovo) is contributing to lower carbon emissions. Zembo’s website says each Zembo bike avoids 1.5 MT of carbon emissions annually — 7.5 MT over the bike’s lifetime. To date, Zembo’s fleet has resulted in 2,195,945 kg CO₂ reduced, over 1,000 drivers powered, and these drivers have covered 37.9 million km. There is also a great financial incentive for the riders to switch to electric motorcycles, as riders can save up to $500 annually on operational and fuel costs. According to Zembo’s website, “Zembo’s lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries offer a range of up to 80 km on a single charge, providing the performance riders need for their daily work. Built with safe and stable LFP technology, these batteries are designed for years of reliable service. They are also among the most affordable options on the market, costing just UGX 6,000 (USD 1.65) per swap. Zembo’s network in Uganda currently features 30 stations strategically located across the country, with plans to double this number by next year. These stations are conveniently situated at popular fuel stations, ensuring easy accessibility for all riders.”Zembo adds that its motorcycles are designed to withstand diverse terrains, rough roads, and heavy usage associated with boda boda utilisation requirements. So, the birthplace of the boda boda electrification pioneered by players such as Zembo. Uganda is actually a great place for electrification of motorcycles, and vehicles in general. According to Uganda’s electricity regulatorERA, the country’s installed electricity generation capacity has been on an upward trend for over a decade. This has been driven by the commissioning of various renewable energy projects, mostly hydro generation projects. Notable ones over the past 5 years include the commissioning of Isimba (183 MW) and Karuma (600 MW) hydropower plants. By the end of Q2 2024, Uganda’s installed capacity had reached 2,048.1 MW, a 63.7% increase from 1,251 MW in 2019. This is pretty impressive. Uganda’s generation mix itself is quite clean. ERA says as of the second quarter 2024, renewable energy projects contributed 95% of all generation capacity of the total installed capacity (2,048.1 MW). Hydroelectricity had the largest share, accounting for 84%. That means a growing number of electric motorcycles in Uganda charge on a grid dominated by renewables. With maximum demand in Uganda hovering at about 1,000 MW, there is a lot of room to grow demand from the electric mobility sector to boost uptake of this excess capacity, ultimately boosting revenues for electricity generation firms. Energy purchases in Uganda by the various consumers were just over 6,000 GWh at the end of 2023, driven mostly by large industries and residential consumers. Zembo is playing a key role in Uganda’s clean mobility sector. “Powered by renewable energy: Wherever Zembo operates, we rely on renewable energy sources to power our bikes. In Uganda — where 96% of electricity comes from renewables — Zembo utilizes the abundant waters of the River Nile to drive sustainable mobility solutions.” Remeredzai Joseph Kuhudzai has been fascinated with batteries since he was in primary school. As part of his High School Physics class he had to choose an elective course. He picked the renewable energy course and he has been hooked ever since.

In April, the administrationissueda similar stop work order, demanding the Empire Wind project in New York to halt construction. The order was quicklyreversedafter advocacy from Sierra Club and other environmental organizations, New York Governor Kathy Hochul, and residents who demanded the project to resume so the state can access cheaper and more reliable energy. In response, Sierra Club Climate Policy Director Patrick Drupp issued the following statement: “We have a hot tip for Donald Trump: if you’re worried about the rising costs Americans are facing, stop cutting off the cheapest form of energy.

The application windows for theHydropower Collegiate Competition(HCC) andMarine Energy Collegiate Competitionare now open. Submissions will be accepted through Sept. 19, 2025. Managed by NREL and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’sWater Power Technologies Office(WPTO), the competitions empower collegiate teams to solve complex marine energy and hydropower challenges for a chance to win cash prizes. “These competitions are designed to find solutions for real energy challenges,” said Elise DeGeorge, NREL’s lead project manager for HCC. “By offering hands-on experience and industry connections, the competitions can open doors and help students gain insight into the expansive career opportunities in water power.” Roughly one quarter of the U.S. hydropower workforce is nearing retirement, and HCC helps pave the way for a new generation of innovators and entrepreneurs who want to advance hydropower technologies, make connections, learn from mentors, and discover a career path in hydropower. The HCC 2026 competition, administered by NREL, aims to address hydropower challenges and explore opportunities using real-world concept development experiences. Teams must select from three development themes: in-conduit, non-powered dam, and pumped storage hydropower systems. The competition, which culminates in the spring of 2026 with a presentation of hydropower concepts to a panel of industry experts, consists of five required challenges and one optional challenge. Up to 15 teams will be selected to compete for cash prizes. Teams that participate in all required challenges will be eligible for up to $15,000 each in cash awards and will compete for part of the $20,000 grand prize cash pool. Teams that compete in the optional challenge will each be eligible for an additional $5,000 cash prize. With technology advancements, marine energy can power applications like autonomous vehicles for ocean exploration, battery and fuel cell technology for marine transportation, and water treatment for coastal and island communities. MECC empowers student teams to help shape the future of marine energy by developing solutions for coastal and maritime markets. MECC teams will compete to solve challenges and gain experience in the emerging marine energy industry. The 2026 MECC has two distinct participation leagues: The competition offers six challenges, including four scored challenges and two optional unscored challenges. The Megawatt League must compete in all four scored challenges, and the Kilowatt League can select from a combination of scored challenges. “Today’s college students will shape tomorrow’s marine energy technologies,” said Arielle Cardinal, NREL lead project manager for MECC. “We’re excited to help them kick off their plans for the future by providing a platform for designing, developing, and testing actual marine energy technology.” Up to 30 teams will be selected to compete for cash prizes. Each league, Kilowatt and Megawatt, offers a separate award pool. Teams that complete all required challenges will each be eligible to receive up to $5,000 in cash awards per submission package. Teams that successfully participate in all required challenges will also be eligible to compete for the grand prize award of up to $20,000.

As someone who’s followed Tesla’s community-driven spectacles for years, this one stood out not just for its altitude but for the sheer coordination and enthusiasm involved. Organized by the Denver Tesla Owners Club, it brought together over 200 Tesla vehicles to set a new Guinness World Record at an elevation of 14,115 feet. It was well organized and I was pleasantly surprised there was no hint of a protest or any negative vibes, making it a testament to electric vehicle resilience in extreme conditions. As night fell on the summit, the Teslas lined up along the winding roads, their headlights, taillights, and even some custom LED setups syncing in a mesmerizing display. The thin air and biting cold posed challenges, yet the batteries held strong, with no reports of significant range loss despite the high altitude. Videos circulating on social media show the lights pulsing to music, creating patterns that lit up the mountain like a futuristic aurora borealis. I took pictures and videos. I’ve included the best photos below. The videos didn’t hold a candle to the video above, so I recommend you watch that to get an idea of the overall show. At first, the club was worried they wouldn’t get enough people to sign up, but in the end, the event was sold out and people were clamoring for tickets. I forgot to secure my ticket in time, but luckily, Jon from Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley had an extra ticket for me. I rode to the event in a black Cybertruck withDanfrom Fort Collins. He picked me up on his trip to Pikes Peak after assisting three vehicles that ran out of electricity (intentionally) while on a range test. One participant posted on X, “Time to set the world record,” capturing the buildup. Another exclaimed, “Highest Tesla Light Show in the world baby!” as the event unfolded. Local news outlets — seehereandhere— covered it from below, describing the glowing spectacle visible for miles. It’s events like these that highlight Tesla’s appeal beyond just transportation — they’re about community and pushing boundaries. For EV enthusiasts, it’s a reminder of how these vehicles perform in real-world extremes, from sub-zero temps to low oxygen levels that could strain traditional engines. Looking ahead, this record might inspire more high-altitude adventures, perhaps even integrating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving tech for automated light patterns. If you’re in Colorado or planning a Tesla road trip, events like this show why the EV community thrives. All in all, the Pikes Peak light show wasn’t just a flash in the pan; it’s a shining example of innovation meeting adventure. I don’t know if this event did much to get more people in electric vehicles, but anything that gets the media to mention the amazing capabilities of the “computers on wheels” in a positive manner could plant the seed in some people’s minds and encourage them to think of them next time they need a new vehicle.

It is about creating an integrated value chain that runs from forests to finished housing modules. That means linking sawmills, energy systems, adhesives, logistics, and modular factories into a coherent industrial strategy. The Transition Accelerator’s roadmap points to a Canadian market worth about $1.2 billion by 2030 and roughly $2.4 billion by 2035, capturing up to a quarter of global share. Meeting those targets requires more than raw material. It requires a system. This is the third in a series on the opportunity that Canada has at the intersection of forestry, cross-laminated timber, economic growth, housing and climate action. Thefirst pieceintroduced the opportunity for Canada to take a dominant position in cross-laminated timber manufacturing, whilethe seconddealt with the key enabler of Mark Carney’s focus on housing and CLT to deal with Canada’s housing crisis. The choke points are already visible. Feedstock is the first. Mass timber products like CLT and glulam need lumber of specific dimensions and moisture content. Mills are optimized for standard framing lumber, not lamstock for engineered wood. That mismatch means mass timber producers often face shortages or pay premiums, and their production can be throttled by inconsistent supply. The second choke point is energy for drying. Lumber has to be dried from green to about 12 percent moisture before it can be bonded into panels. Kilns are energy intensive and in many cases still burn natural gas or diesel. That raises costs and drives embodied emissions. Adhesives are another weak link. The resins used to bond CLT layers are almost all petrochemical based. They perform well but carry a carbon footprint and pose health concerns. Research groups in Canada and abroad are advancing lignin-based and other bioadhesives, but scaling them into production is still ahead of us. Logistics is the final bottleneck. CLT panels and modular units are bulky and heavy. Trucking is the main mode of transport, and it is costly and carbon intensive. Long hauls from distant mills or factories add both emissions and dollars per square meter of housing delivered. An industrial strategy needs to address these choke points directly. Colocating sawmills, CLT lines, glulam plants, and bioenergy facilities in regional hubs is one way. The sawmill produces the lumber, residues feed a bioenergy unit, and the heat and electricity from that unit power the kilns and presses. The CLT and glulam plants convert the lumber into panels and beams. A modular factory nearby turns those panels into modules. Long-term lamstock contracts between sawmills and mass timber producers stabilize supply and avoid the feast or famine cycle that has plagued the industry. Electrifying transport is part of the same vision. Short haul log transport can move to battery electric trucks, while longer distances should shift to rail, ideally electrified over time. Regional hubs reduce the need for hauling across provinces, cutting both cost and carbon. The playbook requires concrete actions. Biomass and hybrid electric kilns are one. Every sawmill generates bark, sawdust, and offcuts. Those residues can fuel high efficiency boilers or be fed into biomass gasifiers to provide process heat and electricity. Heat pump based kilns are another option, using renewable electricity to pull moisture from wood with far greater efficiency than conventional dryers. The switch cuts emissions and insulates mills from fossil fuel price swings. Logistics has to change as well. Canada has abundant rail infrastructure that could be better leveraged for moving panels and modules over distance. For shorter routes, battery electric log trucks have already been tested in British Columbia with promising results. Adhesives are the most difficult but also one of the most promising levers. Moving lignin-based resins from pilot scale into full production will take public and private investment, but once commercial, these adhesives turn a fossil input into another renewable loop in the forestry system. Canada’s chemical industry is capable of supporting that transition if demand is there. The economics of integration are compelling. A breakdown of lifecycle emissions shows that harvesting and transport account for a significant portion of embodied carbon, drying dominates mill stage emissions, and adhesives are the largest non energy contributor in panel assembly. Tackling each of those reduces the emissions stack per cubic meter of CLT. Cost stacks tell a similar story. Transport adds dollars per square meter of floor area when panels travel hundreds of kilometers. Energy spikes project budgets when gas prices rise. Adhesives are one of the single largest line items in panel production. Cutting costs at these choke points makes mass timber more competitive with concrete and steel. Logistics maps illustrate why regional hubs matter. Panels and modules can be trucked economically within about 400 kilometers. Beyond that, costs escalate. Clustering sawmills, CLT lines, and factories around major demand centers like Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal makes sense for both cost and climate reasons. There are risks. Lumber prices are volatile, and mills may hesitate to commit to long term lamstock contracts without strong demand signals. Bioadhesives may take longer to reach market readiness than expected. Provinces may move at different speeds in adopting building code updates, creating a patchwork regulatory environment. Workforce shortages could emerge as factories scale faster than training programs produce skilled workers. At the same time, the enablers are strong. The federal roadmap financing is in place. Low-carbon procurement policies are beginning to favor wood. Indigenous partnerships in forestry and modular manufacturing are gaining momentum. Global demand for low carbon construction materials is climbing steadily. The conclusion is that Canada cannot win by simply adding more sawmills or CLT presses. Success will come from building an integrated system where forests feed sawmills, sawmills feed energy plants and CLT lines, and those feed modular factories that deliver housing. That system reduces costs, stabilizes supply, and slashes emissions. It also builds resilience into the sector, making it less vulnerable to fossil fuel volatility or global shipping disruptions. The opportunity is a triple win for housing supply, economic development, and climate performance. Canada has the resources, the policy framework, and the market pull to execute this playbook. The question is whether we will treat mass timber as an industrial strategy from sawmill to module, or let it remain a niche material in a fragmented sector. is a climate futurist, strategist and author.

From August 21stto 24th, a small EV exposition was hosted in Bogotá’sCarrera Mall,calledExpoferia of EVs and HEVs(not very creative, I know).On Sunday, lacking anything better to do, I decided to stop by to check what was new on the block. And what I saw convinced me Colombia is now past the tipping point in its path towards electrification. First of all, it waspacked(if the pictures don’t look like it, it’s because I tried to get as few people in them as possible). I had issues getting the attention of every single representative I tried to speak with, every one of them being busy and with a couple more people waiting. And I couldn’t get into a single car. This is relevant insofar as the event was organized by a small vehicle/taxi company in their small mall, located in an otherwise not commonly visited area of Bogota. Second, the event included “EVs and hybrids,” but the event was some 85% BEVs and 10% PHEVs, with HEVs accounting for just a handful of models (the Ford Escape and Maverick HEV were there). This is despite HEV sales accounting for more than double EV sales in the country. And third, the event cemented the arrival of an array of affordable EVs that have landed in the country since June, including the Chery ICar 03, the Dongfeng Friday, the JAC E30X, the Deepal S05, and the GAC Aion V. More segments are getting wider availability, and the EV ecosystem now caters to a far larger array of tastes. Besides these models, the event presented the newly arrived Geely Riddara (Radar) pickup, a couple of electric taxis which are now at price parity with their ICEV counterparts, and a wide array of micromobility alternatives, some of which are capable and quite affordable. Oh, and the Xiaomi SU7 was also on display. Legacy automakers were also present in the event, with Chevrolet’s Blazer and Equinox EV, the aforementioned Ford Maverick and Escape HEV, the Kia EV5, and the Hyundai Kona. Honestly, the Equinox EV is quite a beautiful car, and it’s a shame it now costs $7,500 more than the EV5, as otherwise it would probably be leading its segment. But what I found more relevant from the event was the pre-sale of the GAC Aion UT, a capable hatchback with a 44kWh battery which will arrive at Seagull pricing — that is, COP$81,000,000 (USD$20,100). Thisfinallyopens the B hatchback segment to price parity, putting pressure both on similar cars that are currently more expensive (JAC E30X) and on city-cars that offer less for a similar cost (BYD Seagull, Renault Kwid E-Tech, JAC E10X). GAC is not as important a brand as BYD is, so we’ll have to wait to see if there’s a cascade of discounts (as happened when the Seagull first arrived), or if the impact will be felt more slowly. But regardless, the winds of change are here. The explosive growth in 2024 made many of us impatient as market share stopped rising and kept hovering around 8% throughout the last 8 months. But with the interest EVs are harnessing, and with the arrival of so many options in varied segments, I expect it will not take long for Colombia to start another rapid trend of growth and surpass 10% in the next few months, and perhaps 15% by the first half of next year. What do you guys think? Am I being too optimistic here? EDIT: Hopefully, this makes it to the final version. Just in: according to local media, the event was such a success thatExpoferiawill now become an annual exposition.

While we’ve tested a number of power stations with this much storage and far more, there are a few things that really set DJI’s new offering apart from the competition. In this article, I’ll share what makes it special and how it worked for me on a 4,500-mile camping trip across the United States. The first thing I noticed after unboxing the power station was just how compact it is. Despite having the storage it does, it’s not much bigger than a deep cycle RV battery. Even more important than size is shape, and with the simple rectangular arrangement DJI came up with, it’s easy to pack other things around it and on top of it. The handles are arranged not only for easy carry, but also to keep things from covering up the air vents, which prevents overheating when it’s packed away with other gear in a car or a closet. A power station could be the most awesome thing since sliced bread, but if it doesn’t have the right plug for the things YOU want to power, what good is it? So, let’s talk about what you can plug into this one. On the AC side, the Power 2000 has three 20-amp 120-volt plugs and one 30-amp TT-30 plug (like many RVs plug into). Maximum output, per DJI, is 3000 watts, so you can run a number of appliances at a time with no problem. More on that in a bit. The power station also has a number of USB-C and USB-A plugs for directly charging a number of small appliances, laptops, tablets, phones, and anything else that’s USB-powered. It also has two proprietary input-output SDC ports that you can plug a variety of things into, provided you get the right adapter or harness from DJI. Extra batteries to expand storage, solar inputs, rapid charging input, car charging, and fast charging for some recent DJI drones can all be accomplished. It also has an input port to charge the device directly from a wall socket, with two speed settings to adjust power levels on non-dedicated circuits. An app is available for iOS and Android devices to manage the power station, but as with other DJI Android apps, the APK must be directly downloaded. I already have a much larger bank of batteries mounted inside my travel trailer, so the Power 2000 served in a backup and auxiliary role on this trip. But, it came in very handy when I realized that I had forgotten my extension cord for my impact driver. Despite the bursts of energy an impact can suddenly draw, the Power 2000 coped just fine when I used it extend the stabilizers a lot further down than usual to accommodate a strange campsite configuration at Great Smoky Mountains’ Elkmont Campground. Next, I pulled out my travel trailer’s 30-amp connection to see if the 3 kW rating DJI promised was legitimate. I ran an air conditioner, house-sized refrigerator, and lighting for 2 hours, along with short bursts of the microwave and other appliances. Even as the full pull approached 2900 watts, the power station gave no errors and revealed no hidden “gotchas.” DJI delivers on its promise. My next bit of testing for the unit was entirely unplanned. While I was using it to cool off the camper and cook dinner, a pretty strong thunderstorm drifted into the area. I’m a big believer in “When thunder roars, go indoors.” I know I’m picky, but I’m just not a big fan of helping the sky and the earth balance our their electrical imbalances, at least not if my body’s going to serve as the conductor. So, the unit got to sit outside for about an hour of fairly heavy rain, wind, and splashing mud. But, it still took about another hour before the power station shut off, and only then because we had depleted the battery. The total runtime with the AC, fridge, lights, and limited microwave use was about 2 hours. If you’re looking for a power station that can handle heavy loads, is easy to pack/store, and can survive things you’re likely to encounter on camping trips, the DJI Power 2000 is a good choice. Even around the house, it should serve well to cope with power outages. Heck, if you add some extra batteries (up to 22528 Wh), you could use it to run air conditioning and heat at least part-time. The pricing isn’t bad, either. According to theDJI website, the normal price is $1899, but as of this writing, it’s available for $1299. Purchase the Power 2000 fromdji.comorAmazon.

Now there is an enormous shift happening in transportation moving away from fossil fuel use to electrification because fossil fuels cause a great deal of damage to the planet and human health. Electric vehicles in the US at least have become overly politicized, and therefore the many benefits electric vehicles have may be overlooked by some portion of Americans. Anyone who follows electric vehicles knows there is far too much misinformation and disinformation online about electric vehicles. There are forms of transportation that are not mechanized in the sense of having a motor for propulsion. Bicycling has many health benefits because riding bikes is physical exercise which is great for human well being. Lately, when researching for articles, I have been returning to information published by Harvard University. (The President has tried tofreeze fundingto this university, perhaps because it is a major research institution and it may sometimes publish information he does not like, though the freeze was framed in some language about antisemitism.)What did Harvard Health Publishing writeabout exercise? “Exercising regularly — every day if possible — is the single most important thing you can do for your health. In the short term, exercise helps to control appetite, boost mood, and improve sleep. In the long term, it reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia, depression, and many cancers.” Human mental health may also benefit from cycling as described recently by somenew research.“Previous studies have reported the health benefits of cycling, including a decrease in an individual’s risk of developing specific illnesses. Now, a recent study has revealed that persons who use bicycles as their primary form of transportation may be at a lower risk of developing dementia. Cycling was associated with a 19% reduction in dementia and a 22% reduction in Alzheimer’s risk.” The mechanism, as reported, may be from the active exercise while navigating, and balancing. “Upon examining brain scans, researchers discovered that cycling and cycling in conjunction with other modes of transportation were associated with minor increases in gray matter volume (GMV) in specific brain regions, such as the hippocampus, which is critical for memory.” There were no brain anatomy effects documented by the research for driving, or non-active travel. Imagine for a moment, if there wasn’t any gasoline, diesel, or coal. What if all transportation ran on electricity and was powered by solar power, wind power, geothermal, hydroelectric power and wave power? What if all cities had electric light rail and electric buses, and were mostly car-free? The young woman in this video, who lives in Copenhagen, says she has been biking in her city since she was 6 years old.

Or not, as the case may be. When the Trump administration brought the Revolution Wind project to a screeching halt last week, they offered up a pathetically thin excuse that practically sits up and begs for further investigation. Mystery has been swirling around the stop-work order ever since Friday, August 22, when Matthew Giacona, the Acting Director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management at the US Department of the Interior, issued a letter telling the Danish firm Ørsted to “halt all ongoing activitiesrelated to the Revolution Wind Projecton the outer continental shelf (OCS)” while the his office addresses “concerns that have arisen during the review that the Department is taken pursuant to the President’s Memorandum of January 20, 2025.” As for why those concerns were not addressed when the Revolution Wind site was first identified as appropriate for offshore wind development, that’s a good question. BOEM is the federal agency tasked with defining offshore wind areas for lease to developers. The process involves assessing both environmental and national security concerns as well as issues related to tourism, fishing, shipping, and other competing interests, before the perimeter of a lease area is established. The Revolution Wind site is located off the busy coasts of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and the equally busy Atlantic seaboard state of Connecticut is also involved as a partner in the project, making the task a particularly complex one. After reviewing all of this and more, BOEM issuedthe offshore leasefor the area that hosts Revolution Wind a dozen years ago, all the way back in 2013. Nevertheless, Giacona raised the idea that national security issues have suddenly popped up like mushrooms after a rain. “In particular, BOEM is seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States and prevention of interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas,” Giacona emphasized. It will be interesting to see what specific national security concerns Giacona has been looking at. In particular, it will be interesting to see if similar concerns have arisen regarding theCoastal VirginiaOffshore Wind project, which is also currently under construction. After all, Virginia hosts Naval Station Norfolk, the largest military facility of its kind in the world, and CVOW is billed as the largest offshore wind farm in the US, so wouldn’t BOEM want to take a look over there, too? On second thought, naw. Why would the Trump administration want to embarrass Virginia’s Republican Governor, Glenn Youngkin, who has championed the CVOW project, especially when the ripe targets of Democratic-governed states like Rhode Island and Connecticut are available? Political expediency aside, speculation will abound in all directions until Interior demystifies the mysterious national security concerns. One direction is indicated by the involvement of a new gas pipeline proposal, considering what happened after the Interior Department issued a stop-work order against Equinor’s Empire Wind project in New York earlier this year. Interior reversed the order shortly after New York Governor Kathy Hochul reportedly pledged not to gum up the works if and when (spoiler alert: when) the formerly mothballedConstitution natural gas pipleline proposalwas taken out of the closet for an airing in New York State. Similarly, right after the November election results rolled in last fall, the Canadian firm Enbridge announced its intention to move forward with Project Maple, a major expansion of its existing pipeline network from gas fields in Pennsylvania to points east, including Rhode Island and Connecticut among other states. Keep an eye on next steps for Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont and Rhode Island Governor Daniel McKee, both of whom have come outswinging against the stop-work order. Aside fromthe loss of clean kilowatts, a permanent halt to the Revolution Wind project would impact hundreds of portside jobs in Rhode Island and thousands more across Ørsted’s 40-state supply chain in the US. The pipeline connection crossed theCleanTechnicaradar over the weekend, andCanary Mediareporter Clare Flessler added some detail tothe national security issueon August 24, citing a former Massachusetts official who participated in BOEM’s offshore wind area site selection process from 2009 to 2015. The official affirmed that military representatives were represented and closely consulted during the process. “There were no major military issues that came to the fore in New England,” the official toldCanary Media. As recently as April of 2023, Flessler notes, the Pentagon raised concerns over offshore wind development farther to the south, along the coast Virginia as well as Maryland and North Carolina, too. “But the Pentagon has not raised those kinds of high-level concerns over Revolution Wind — or any of the projects being built in New England’s waters,” Flessner reported. So, what new national security issue suddenly creeped out of the woodwork between between 2023 and 2025? Hmmm…well, lots of things. For one thing, In 2025 the US government began expressing an interest inannexing Greenland, which is a self-governing territory under the Kingdom of Denmark. That callsØrsted into play, because Ørsted is a publicly listed state-owned enterprise with the Kingdom of Denmark controlling a 50.1% majority stake. US President Donald Trump, who relentlessly promotes himself as the best dealmaker in the world, has so far failed to pressure Danish authorities into budging on the Greenland issue, so perhaps putting the squeeze onØrstedwill help move matters along. If so, that might not sit too well with members of the Danish Parliament, who approveda new defense agreementwith the US covering the use of military bases in Karup, Skrydrup, and Aalborg. The agreement was signed in 2o23 but not finalized until Parliament voted to approve it in June, by a margin of 94-11. Coincidentally or not, California Governor Gavin Newsom also added fuel to the foreign relations fire last week. On Friday, August 22 — the same day that Giacona halted work on the offshore wind project — Newsome announced a new Memorandum of Understanding between California and Denmark “supporting cooperation ongreen economy resilience, technology, and innovation.” “Home to Silicon Valley and the world’s fourth largest economy, California is uniquely positioned to lead the international conversation and help guide the world in the responsible implementation and use of emerging technology,” Newsom’s office wrote, handily clapping back at President Trump’sSoviet-style “American Energy Dominance” policy. Oh, lordy.

Predicting the future accurately is impossible. If we could do so, there would be no need for sporting contests, as the result of games would be known in advance. But by paying close attention to small developments, we sometimes can get a glimpse of what the future might be. One of our regular readers — Bryan FW — recently posted a comment on aCleanTechnicaarticle that seemed particularly insightful. He wrote: “The evolution here, once battery packs became cheap enough and ubiquitous enough, is that those consumers with the most resources will exit the grid first. Those remaining will become increasingly riskier as paying customers, creating either lower utility profits or government intervention where government increasingly subsidizes utilities until it becomes effectively the single payer for those remaining (except in libertarian states, of course, where people who can’t pay have to go back to the nineteenth century). “Either utility profits go away, or grid improvements halt. I think we can all guess which….The concept of moving electrons over great distance becomes obsolete. No more efficiencies of scale, no more fungible electricity markets, no more grand vision of harvesting the sun as it moves across the continent. “And that’s not necessarily a bad thing. With that decrease in efficiency comes a corresponding increase in redundancy. Ransomware or enemy action or natural disaster may take down microgrids here and there, but we just won’t be seeing these widespread failures that are so difficult and costly to deal with anymore. Globalization is the past; islanding is the future.” His words may be prescient. There have been lots of headlines this week about how cheap solar panels imported from China have transformed life for many in Pakistan. Where previously the electricity provided by traditional power generators and distributed via a creaky energy grid was expensive and unreliable, now many Pakistanis are simply exiting the electricity market and taking responsibility for their own energy needs. A report byEnergy Monitordated August 20, 2025, says that Pakistan imported 17 GW of solar PV and an estimated 1.25 GWh of lithium-ion battery packs in 2024. The expectations are that by 2030, battery imports could increase to 8.75 GWh, which would be enough to meet over a quarter of peak demand. Solar by day, storage by night would become the new norm for the country. “The surge in solar and batteries is not only driving down energy costs for Pakistani users but also enhancing reliability and contributing to the country’s energy sovereignty by reducing dependence on imported fuels,”Energy Monitorsays. There are bumps in the road, however. The transformation “poses new challenges for grid resilience and system integration. The rapid growth of distributed energy is creating a divide between grid-dependent users and those who can afford off-grid solutions such as rooftop solar and batteries.” That is pretty much what Bryan FW predicted in his comment. Energy Monitoradds, “Pakistan’s energy transition underscores the need for utility-scale solar projects to complement rooftop and distributed systems, essential for meeting growing demand and facilitating the transition. Financing solutions must cater to all segments of the population to ensure that the rapid shift to solar and storage benefits the entire power system.” “Other emerging economies can draw valuable insights from Pakistan’s experience. Recommendations include making the energy transition inclusive, integrating distributed energy into the system, including legacy assets, incorporating the mobility sector, and planning ahead for scale.” A careful reader might fairly conclude that the energy transition could be messy — something common to most technology revolutions. It is worth noting that theWashington Postran a story with a headline that focused on the impact this solar revolution will have on Pakistanis who cannot afford solar and storage systems and are burdened by higher energy costs. The headline — “How Pakistan’s solar energy boom led to higher power bills for the poor” — may be accurate, but its emphasis seems designed to appeal to the MAGAverse first and foremost, something the Jeff Bezos-owned newspaper has made its primary editorial policy since January 20. AsCleanTechnicareported last year, in November, 2024, theWorld Economic Forumsaid that Pakistan’s rapid adoption of solar power, which is being driven primarily by market forces and with only minimal political support, provides valuable lessons for other emerging markets. “Declining solar panel prices, coupled with skyrocketing grid electricity tariffs that have increased by 155% over three years, are fueling a rush in renewable energy adoption in Pakistan, with solar power leading the way. The country is now the world’s sixth-largest solar market,” it said. The driving force behind the surge in solar power in Pakistan is economics, not policies. Many countries feel threatened by China’s overproduction of solar panels, which has driven down their cost to the point where they are ridiculously cheap. As a result, Pakistan is now the third largest importer of Chinese-made solar panels. If Pakistan had its own solar panel industry, it would impose significant import duties on those panels from China, but it does not. Therefore, the influx of cheap panels is welcomed by most Pakistanis, but not all. Industrial, agricultural, and residential sectors have embraced solar, with imported Chinese modules totaling 13 GW added in the first half of 2024. Forecasters predicted that figure wouldrise to 22 GWby end of 2024. Kaiser Bengali, an economist who worked as an adviser to the chief minister of Pakistan’s southeastern Sindh province, saysthe influx of Chinese panelshas sparked an episode of “circular debt” where those still reliant on the expensive state power grid need to choose between saving money to switch to solar or refusing to pay their bills. If they choose the latter, it could spark a cascade of unpaid debts. Consumption of electricity from the national grid fell by 10% in 2023 compared to the previous year amid rising electricity prices, and this decrease could deepen as Islamabad faces pressure to increase electricity prices in order to repay a loan from the International Monetary Fund. Part of the problem is the inability of the national grid to deliver a stable supply of electricity. The International Energy Agency reports that Pakistan’sper capitaelectricity consumption grew by 87% between 2000 and 2022, yet more than 40 million people remain without access to electricity and half the population still lacks clean cooking facilities. Many more live in off-grid or under-served areas, without access to electricity for more than 4 hours a day. Meanwhile, record-breaking heat waves are boosting demand for basic cooling from fans and air conditioners. Here we see the importance of Bryan FW’s comments. Upsetting the status quo will have important economic and policy considerations for Pakistan and not everyone will be a winner. But the path ahead seems clear. There are many countries that do not have stable electrical grids and who must import oil, coal, or LNG to power their generating stations. Now there is a way to leapfrog over all those issues, just as cell phones leapfrogged over issues associated with telephone networks that depended on wires. The world is on the cusp of a clean energy revolution that will undo much of what is considered normal in electricity generation and distribution. You can spot the changes if you look carefully. The new watchwords will be resiliency and self sufficiency — concepts that strike fear into the hearts of traditional utility companies. But the result will be more people who have direct control over their own personal energy supply either through self-generation or through reliance onlocal microgrids. We once thought New York City would be powered by clean energy imported from California, but now we see that in reality, it will be powered by locally produced electricity that is created during the day and distributed at night, thanks to energy storage technologies that are just now making their presence felt on a meaningful level. We don’t know for sure that Bryan FW’s crystal ball is completely accurate, but there are signs that his vision iswell on its way to fruition. The traditional model for how electricity is created and distributed was created in the 19th century. That model is rapidly become obsolete, thanks to renewables.

I’ve been a fan of electric bikes for years, because they help more people get outside and exercise. They’re also fun to use and extend the range of places people feel comfortable biking. However, the gold standard, the biggest aim of electric bikes, has to be replacing car trips with more bike trips. And that’s been my question — how much are ebike trips replacing car trips, versus how much are they replacing normal fully human-powered bike trips? I have seen some people ebiking recently who were clearly doing so for utilitarian purposes — with a backpack of tennis rackets on their back, with groceries in the basket, or on other transportation trips. This brought that question above back to mind. With the electric bike market growing and growing, are people starting to use these ebikes for normal transportation more and more? Another thing that got me thinking about this is that Lectric eBikes has pointed out that theLectric XP 3.0 ebikeis the 3rd best selling EV in the US, only trailing the Tesla Model Y and Tesla Model 3. Lectric also just launched theXP 4.0, its most advanced model yet, designed to build on that momentum. It’s actually a pet peeve of mine when people assume EV only stands for “electric car,” because it’s much broader than that and covers all kinds of electric vehicles. However, it was still a bit of an eye opener to see Lectric frame it like that — and rightly so! If the Lectric XP 3.0 ebike is the 3rd best selling EV model in the USA, it is. And many of those riders will be biking for transportation rather than taking a car. Searching around, I can’t find great statistics definitively showing how much more people are using ebikes for transportation rather than using cars (or normal bikes, for that matter). Most of the research I’m finding is from several years ago, but much of the general narrative from the past few years is that people started biking, especially ebiking, much more during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the point is that ebikes do enable more, further biking for a lot of people, which makes it more feasible for them to ditch the car and bike instead. “Recent research from Portland State University found that e-bikes encourage new people to ride, gets those who already ride to ride more often, and people feel safer when riding e-bikes than standard bikes. E-bikes are replacing car trips as well. Results indicated that e-bike rides replaced 1,778 motor vehicle miles (average of 9.3 miles per trip) just within the last three trips reported by respondents,”PeopleForBikeswrites. Laka, a UK-based bike insurance company, writes that, “Among the major reasons for riding e-bikes are replacing car trips, improving fitness, and riding with less effort.“ The fact that the top reason for riding an ebike according to the data above is to replace car trips does tell us that ebikes are making a big difference. Here’s more on from eBicycles.com: So, yes, ebikes are actually replacing car trips. How much so depends on the data source, but it’s clear people are ebiking instead of driving thanks to the corebenefits of an ebike. All those Lectric ebike sales aren’t in place of Tesla Model 3 sales or Toyota Corolla sales, but some of them are! Zach is tryin' to help society help itself one word at a time.

Lets look at the number of EVs registered in Zambia before and after Zambia removed customs duty on electric electric motorcycles, electric vehicles, electric buses, electric trucks, and attendant accessories such as charging systems. According to Zambia’s Road transport and Safety Agency, as of July 2023, there were 62 electric vehicles registered in Zambia. These were as follows: Total Number Of Electric Vehicles Registered In Zambia As Of July 2023(Before Removal Of Import Duties) Total Number Of Electric Vehicles Registered In Zambia As Of November 2023 (Just Before Removal Of Import Duties) Now 2 years on from July 2023, as of the end of July 2025, there are now 269 electric vehicles registered in Zambia according to RTSA. We are still waiting for the breakdown of the registrations by vehicle type. Small numbers? Yes, but it is encouraging that there is now some growth in the number of electric vehicles registered in Zambia since removal of customs duties on electric motorcycles, electric vehicles, electric buses, electric trucks, and attendant accessories such as charging systems. The numbers are still low, but every EV that replaces the potential purchase of an ICE vehicle still makes a difference and the numbers all add up in the long term. From the figures above, we can see that just over 200 electric vehicles were added over the past 2 years. That’s over 330% growth over that period. Impressive, even though it’s coming from a very small base. Let’s take a look at the overall Zambia vehicle market. According to the most recent available figures from the Zambia Road transport and Safety Agency’s 2023 Annual report, a total of 86,846 vehicles were registered in the period under review (2023) compared to 61,051 vehicles registered in 2022 and 45,277 in 2021 on the Electronic Zambian Transport Information System (E-ZamTIS). In 2023, a total of 122,775 motor vehicles were imported in 2023, up from 92,895 in 2022 and 64,256 imported in 2021. The report says the difference between the number of imported vehicles and the number that was registered in 2023 (35,929) was due to the lag time between imports and sales recorded by motor vehicle dealers. Overall, Zambia’s total vehicle population as of the end of 2023 was 823,703 across all vehicle classes and segments. The majority of vehicles imported into Zambia are used ICE vehicles from places such as Japan. These vehicles then land at prices that are more palatable for the level of buying power in the country for most consumers. As most electric vehicles have for a long time been priced above their ICE equivalents, it means for countries such as Zambia where most consumers already can’t afford a brand new ICE vehicle, brand new EVs were even more out of reach for the majority. The government’s noble move to remove customs duty on electric motorcycles, electric vehicles, electric buses, electric trucks, and attendant accessories such as charging systems was therefore a very welcome development to incentivize the adoption of electric vehicles. As this also applies to used EVs, the prices of used EV imports are now therefore more competitive with the prices of used ICE imports. That’s one barrier taken care off. The next barrier to adoption was the availability of both new and used electric vehicles on the Zambian market. There are also positive developments on the new vehicle market as players such as BYD have entered the Zambian market in collaboration with local partners.BYD’s entry adds to the small but growing list of new BEVs that are now available on the Zambian market. Last year, Southern Cross, the official distributors of GWM’s brands of motor vehicles, launched the Ora 03 in the Zambian market. Several independent dealers are also adding a mix of new and used electric vehicles, including the 40 kWh and 62 kWh Nissan Leafs. These used vehicles are now at price points comparable with a number of used ICE models in this market, which will help a lot. There are also a growing number of used EVs in the usual source markets for right-hand drive vehicles, which helps lower another barrier. There are several firms that are also installing charging infrastructure. This will help ease a lot of concerns around range anxiety. One concern that could be still lingering in people’s minds is the issue of electricity rationing, infamously known as load-shedding. Zambia’s electricity generation mix is dominated by hydro. Due to several years of lower than normal rainfall, Zambia’s hydropower plants have had to curtail electricity generation, leading to daily power rationing schedules. With basic planning, EV owners should be able to comfortably drive their EVs in Zambia even with this load-shedding,as we have seen in Zimbabwe. One area that could help ease charging fears is the growing solar sector. Solar has been shown to be one of the fastest ways to add some good capacity to the energy mix, and it’s good to see Zambia is starting to develop more utility-scale solar plants. An example of this is the 100MW Chisamba solar plant which was commissioned recently. There are more utility-solar scale plants on the way in Zambia and these, along with other initiatives in Zambia’s power sector, will go a long way towards addressing the electricity generation shortfall. Of course, individual homes and businesses can generate their own electricity using rooftop solar to cushion themselves from the impacts of electricity rationing and if space allows, they could also install additional capacity to power EVs. EVs and solar make the perfect combination. Many thanks to the Zambian Electric Mobility and Innovation Alliance (ZEMIA), for additional insights into the Zambian EV market.

EV startup Rivian’s on-again, off-again plans for a massive new electric vehicle factory in Georgia are on track again, much to the delight of the Governor. Will those plans run off the rails again? Who knows! We’ll know for sure on September 16, when a groundbreaking ceremony is reportedly scheduled to take place. Rivian’s new Project Horizon electric vehicle factory will add about 7,500 permanent jobs to the Georgia economy when fully up and running, churning out400,000 vehicles per year. Rivian announced its intent to build the new facility in Georgia back in 2021 only to mothball it while working on an expansion of its Illinois factory. Project Horizon was on again as of last November, when Rivian received a $6.57 billion conditional loan commitment from the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office. The final approval came through on January 16 and everything was coming up roses, that is, until US President Donald Trump took office on January 20. Shortly thereafter, Trump’s Office of Management and Budget issued a memo freezing the entire loan program. Or not, as the case may be. The memo quickly flew into the dustbin on the heels ofa court challengein February. Since then, a favored few projects havetrickled through the loan pipeline, a $1.44 billion loan for the Montana Renewables alternative fuel project in Montana being one example. As with Project Horizon, the loan was issued during the Biden administration, shortly before Trump took office. However, Montana (a subsidiary of Calumet) somehow saw itsloan unfrozenin March, reportedly after Republican Senator Steve Daines went to bat for the project. So, is Rivian’s loan similarly out of the deep freeze? News reports suggest that is so. In order to access the funds, Rivian simply needs to reset the construction clock. The timeline leaves plenty of wiggle room, since the loan agreement is in effect until September of 2028. However, there’s no sense in burning daylight when bothGeneral MotorsandFordhave just announced ambitious new electric vehicle plans of their own, which helps explain the rush to break ground sooner rather than later. The site has also been graded and prepared for vertical construction over the past several years, helping to move the timeline forward. The Rivian announcement — and the 7,500 new jobs — came at a good time for Governor Kemp. Regardless of federal electric vehicle policy, Kemp has his own political reputation to polish, and he is term-limited as of 2027. His next career move will rest partly on his job creating track record over two terms in office, which is now sitting on shaky ground due to the looming fallout from Trump’s economic policies, such as they are. Rivian’s new electric vehicle factory will more than make up for some bad news Kemp received on August 21, when the US-based paper manufacturer International Paper announced plans to invest $250 million to revamp one of its facilities in Alabama, whilepermanently shuttingdown a containerboard mill and a packaging facility in Savannah, Georgia, as well as the Riceboro Timber and Lumber mill. As a result, International Paper expects to axe around 1,100 hourly and salaried employees in Georgia. Not to worry, said Kemp last week. “I’ve mobilized the Technical College System, the Georgia Department of Labor, and the Department of Economic Development to connect affected workers with new opportunities,” he said in a statement released by his office. “Thankfully, the strong state economy we’ve built together over the last seven years has made our job market healthy and resilient, with a steady pipeline of investments and opportunities coming to the regions affected by this announcement,” he added, referring to coastal Georgia. “Since I took office, we’ve announced roughly 27,500 new jobs and $14.2 billion in investment in that area of the state, and that doesn’t include organic growth,” he added for good measure. For the record, Project Horizon will be located in central Georgia, near Atlanta. But, jobs is jobs. If all goes according to plan, Rivian will introduce its new electric vehicle plans to the community on September 14, with a formal groundbreaking ceremony to follow on the 16th with Governor Kemp in attendance among other officials. Whelp, that should be interesting. Partisan politics aside, a spokesperson for Kemp’s office has told media that the Governor and First Lady “look forward to joining Rivian and state and local leaders to break ground on this next chapter inGeorgia’s ongoing economic success story.” In addition to jobs directly related to the electric vehicle factory, Kemp and his Department of Economic Development can also take credit for bringingRivian’s new headquartersto Atlanta, beginning with 100 employees and eventually working up to 500. Kemp announced the new headquarters on July 17, just a few days after the Republican majority in Congress sent the all-important federal EV tax credit to an early grave. Or, perhaps the tax credit is not so important after all, at least not in the long run. On his part, Kemp did not appear ruffled. “Georgia is a prime location for any company headquarters,” Kemp said in a press statement, adding that Rivian recognizes the “unmatched value of Georgia’s talent and the location of their East Coast Headquarters in Atlanta is the latest demonstration of their commitment to the Peach State.” “I look forward to that commitment translating to new jobs and opportunities for hardworking Georgians,” Kemp concluded. That’s just for starters. As with any major manufacturing venture in the US, Rivian’s long term plan includes partnership with state and local academic and technical institutions. The Rivian restart also follows on the heels of Hyundai’s massive“Metaplant” factorynear Savannah. The new factory, billed as the biggest economic development project in Georgia history, commenced initial operations last fall. When fully up and running it will employ 8,500 people and produce 500,000 electric vehicles per year including hybrids as well as full BEVs.

The US dollar hastaken a beatingthis year, losing ground to other major currencies like the euro. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which measures the value of the dollar against a basket of 10 leading global currencies, fell almost 11% in 2025’s first six months, marking itsworst first-halfperformance since 1973.” In essence, the US dollar is currently performing worse than almost any other time since it was backed by gold reserves. This is a significant shift with wide-ranging global implications. Not only is Trump increasing the price of imported goods through tariffs, but also increasing the price by making our currency worth less in relation to other currencies. US Newsalso published a few recommendations, clearly intended for US-based investors, on how to invest with the weakening dollar. At the same time, I was reading throughMichael Barnard’sexcellent series on theworld’s EV inflection pointsand his article on thedifferent pathsin the transition from coal to renewable energy. Connecting the dots, I started thinking about international cleantech investment potential while the dollar declines and the importance of keeping on top of the transition happening globally … even if it seems to be stumbling at home. Some of the recommendations fromUS Newsrelated to large US-based companies with strong international sales, or international stocks. When the dollar is down and sales in rising currencies are converted back into dollars, the revenue in dollars effectively increases. However, global markets are not the same as the US. It is easy to base decisions upon what you have first-hand experience with around you. Regarding the clean technology transition, it can be easy to think that it is stalling everywhere based onlaggingdomestic performance. However, other countries, like Norway, are transforming much faster, creating new investment opportunities in the process. Additional investment recommendations fromUS Newsfocused on emerging markets. China is clearly achieving renewable energy and EVtipping pointsat an accelerating rate. It now leads in cleantech sales, production,IP quantity, andIP quality. However, while some companies are stronglyprofitable, the market is highly competitive and labor costs have risen. Chinese companies are now increasingly looking to invest internationally, withglobal EV investmentsnow overtaking investments in their home market. In many developing countries, China has replaced the US in terms ofaid and financing. Trade is shifting from the largest petroleum producer to the largest clean technology producer. China has been expanding as Africa’stop trading partner for the past 16 yearsand recently removed tariffs on the continent. For example, in Ethiopia, considered to be themodelBRIcountry,economic growthhas been impressive, andEV penetrationleads much of the developing world. Other developing countries, particularly those in BRICS, could follow suit. This would not only create opportunities for Chinese companies, but also for local startups and supply chains. There could be a lot of potential in the African startups I seeRemeredzai Joseph Kuhudzaidescribe, likeAmpersand. I can also see opportunities in the developments covered byRaymond Tribdinoin Asia andJuan Diego Celemín Mojicain Latin America. Commodities were also mentioned as a possible way to benefit from a declining dollar. Many commodities, particularly fossil fuels, are traded globally inUS dollars. When the dollar declines compared to other currencies, the dollar price of oil traded on global markets tends to go up. This could have some benefit for US domestic oil producers, while increasing prices to US consumers. In addition, as more people shift investments into that commodity, the price tends to go higher. However, if you were a global petroleum producer selling a commodity in a currency that has lost value, but are paying for production costs (labor, electricity, etc.) in local currencies that have increased relatively in value, it stands to reason that it could become more difficult to turn a profit. As such, global oil production could become more challenging due to the currency it is being traded in becoming more volatile. US citizens investing in commodities might be a smart move, but global producers of commodities could suffer. This could help to explain why major US banks have recently beenslashing financingto petroleum producers. However, as countries move away from burning commodities that are traded in US dollars, they will also have less use for dollars, and values could drop further. I am not a financial advisor, and this shouldn’t be considered investment advice. However, it seems that the declining dollar could make investments in global companies, operating in markets moving away from fossil fuels, more attractive. Volatility in a once-stable currency used for petroleum trades could also accelerate the economic transition abroad. I don’t pretend to have all the answers, but I do see a lot of possibilities and opportunities in the global transition. It is hard to know which way the markets will turn. However, with the declining dollar, it makes sense to pay attention to what is happening globally and stay on top of the accelerating clean technology transition abroad, even if the transition seems to be slowing at home.

Let’s take a look at the market as a whole in the 2nd quarter as well as trends with individual companies. Overall, US auto sales were up 3% in Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2024, and also up 3% in Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2023. That’s much different from the first two post-COVID years of 2021 (down 10%) and 2022 (up 17%). Naturally, markets were quite warped for a while, especially with supply chain challenges in the auto industry related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as well as the COVID crisis. The leading auto brands in the country were Ford and Toyota in Q2 2025, followed by Chevrolet, Honda, and Hyundai. As another example of Tesla’s fall, the all-electric US brand dropped from9th in Q2 2024to 11th in Q2 2025. Not great. Can the EV company get back into the top 10? We’ll see…. Other all-electric brands Rivian and Lucid were ranked 31st and 33rd, respectively. Rivian was down from 29th a year before, while Lucid repeated its ranking in 33rd place. Yes, I know — is it worth talking about their rankings at this point? Well, you’ve got to start somewhere. The bad news here for EV brands is that Tesla sales dropped by 13%, or 20,729 units, year over year in Q2, and Rivian sales dropped by 23%, or 3,129 units, in the same time. On the positive side, Lucid sales were up 10%, or by 241 units. Comparing to Q2 2023, we can again see that the country’s biggest auto brands (Ford, Toyota, Chevrolet, Honda, and Hyundai) saw solid growth in Q2. On a percentage basis, Fiat surged the most, but Fiat barely sells any cars in the US. (That said, they’re all electrics.) Lucid was second for percentage growth, but, again, it hardly sells any vehicles. Again, we see big declines from Tesla (-18%, or -31,727 units) and Rivian (-16%, or -1,979 units). Just as a note, though, electric vehicle sales were up strongly overall — a point we’ll come back to in a separate article. Going back to Q2 2022, we finally see growth from Rivian (+139%, or +6,194 units) and Tesla (+10%, or +13,488 units) again. And, to wrap up this section, we can see that Tesla sales grew 88% from Q2 2021 to Q2 2025, more than any auto brand other than Lexus. On a volume basis, only Ford grew more. So, it’s still a stunning improvement across four years for the country’s leading EV seller. More broadly, it’s clearly been a good amount of growth for Ford and Lexus. The last chart I’ll post here is one looking at all of these brands across all of these years. Below is both a static chart and an interactive chart (both best viewed on a real computer, not a phone). It’s a giant chart, and you can spend a lot of time looking through the trends across the brands from Q2 2021 to Q2 2025. Enjoy! Zach is tryin' to help society help itself one word at a time.

Dr. James Hansen, the noted NASA scientist who first testified in front of the US Congress about the connection between carbon dioxide and a warming, has been a vocal advocate for the group’s work. In fact, his granddaughter was one of the young plaintiffs in the groundbreaking case ofJuliana Vs. US, which sought to obtain a ruling that the federal government has a duty to protect the lives and health of its citizens, a position that is bitterly opposed by the fossil fuel industry. Our Children’s Trust did achieve amilestone victory in Montanarecently. Section 1 of Article IX of the Montana constitution says specifically: The Montana Supreme Court has now ruled that section means precisely what it says and has invalidated laws passed by the state’s legislature that were designed to limit the application of Article IX. Now Our Children’s Trust has teamed up with an environmental law firm in Wisconsin called Midwest Environmental Advocates to represent a group of 15 young Wisconsin residents in a legal action that seeks to invalidate two state statutes. They claim those statures unfairly benefit fossil fuel powered thermal electricity generation and limit the amount of renewable energy available within the state. In addition, the lawsuit alleges the continued use of fossil fuels in energy generation is harming their young plaintiffs’ basic constitutional rights and creating an unstable future for them. The case was filed on August 22 against the Public Service Commission and the state legislature. “The science around how climate change is going to affect Wisconsin is clear. It’s affecting us now. It’s only going to get worse, and it will get worse if Wisconsin keeps pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,” Tony Wilkin-Gibart, the executive director of MEA and one of the lawyers for the case, told the press. “We believe that (their constitutional rights are) being violated by the state continuing to pump greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere and drive the climate crisis in ways that are harming our clients and profoundly disrupting their ways of life and jeopardizing the stability of their future,” Wilkin Gibart said, according to a report byWisconsin Public Radio. “Our clients are asking the court to uphold their right to a livable future,” he said. “This case is about whether they will inherit a future shaped by clean energy and a stable climate — or one burdened by fossil fuel pollution, extreme weather events, and growing threats to their health and safety.” Specifically, one Wisconsin law today prevents the state’s public service commission from considering toxic and planet-heating air pollution when considering permits for new fossil fuel power plants, while another bars the PSC from requiring utilities to increase the amount of electricity they obtain from carbon-free sources. “These laws set up a system where the public service commission continues to approve fossil fuel power plants and cannot bring online more renewable energy,” Nate Bellinger, supervising staff attorney at Our Children’s Trust, toldThe Guardian. Wisconsin has pledged to transition to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050, but those laws are diametrically opposed to implementing that policy initiative. “The state legislature and the executive branch have both set goals and mandates to decarbonize the electricity sector,” said Bellinger. “These laws are getting in the way of that.” He claimed the laws in Wisconsin are ripe for a challenge. “The case is really a challenge to the electricity sector in Wisconsin, which is still predominantly powered by fossil fuels, and there’s a lot of opportunity there to transition that to renewables,” he said. The lawsuit criticizes the PSC for not requiring utilities to invest more than 10% in renewable energy and points to policies in Wisconsin that give fossil fuels like coal and natural gas an edge when it comes to choosing and developing new power plants. Fossil fuels provide about 75 percent of Wisconsin’s electricity today. “The trends that we’re seeing in Wisconsin are so profound, and the impacts of climate change are affecting Wisconsinites right now,” Wilkin-Gibart said. “We’re on track for a record number of smoke-filled days this summer. This entire summer has been marked by thoughts and anxiety about whether young people, and frankly any Wisconsinites, can go out and exercise and spend time with family.” The complaint claims the young plaintiffs are exposed to a greater incidence of health risks, including asthma and respiratory illnesses made worse by increases in average temperatures and air pollution, flooding of their homes and communities, and mental health trauma tied to ecological loss and extreme weather events. Perhaps the latest study that shows climate-related pollution contributes to over90,000 premature deathsin the US each year will bolster their case. “We’re in a situation here in the state where we have state laws that tell our Public Service Commission to completely ignore these climate impacts, to completely ignore what our clients are experiencing, and to completely ignore the fate of these young people and future generations,” Wilkin-Gibart said. Ted Schultz-Becker is one of the young plaintiffs. He said in a press release reported by theMilwaukee Journal Sentinelthat the lawsuit represents a chance to have the voices of Wisconsin youth heard. “These laws force my government to ignore science and pollution. That’s wrong and unconstitutional. Young people have power, even when we can’t vote. Our voices matter, and we trust our Constitution and courts to protect us.” The attorneys are asking a judge to strike down state laws that limit consideration of climate effects and cap renewable energy requirements when regulators determine whether to approve or deny new projects. They want a judge to rule the laws violate their clients’ constitutional rights and find that the Public Service Commission and Legislature have a duty to protect the health and welfare of the young plaintiffs. The lawsuit is likely to face opposition from the Republican-controlled Legislature and its top leaders. Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos is on record as saying that climate change “probably” is real. Wisconsin Democrats have repeatedly introduced a package of bills to combat climate change andshift to clean energy, but Vos has said such efforts are only “pandering to the very liberal base.” Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu has said such legislation would only “triple down on the ‘Green New Deal’ disaster.” Republican lawmakers have also promoted legislation that would prevent state and local governments from enacting mandates that favor electric vehicles or restrict the use of propane or methane stoves, claiming they want to protect consumer choices. Governor Tony Evers vetoed those bills because he said they would limit the state’s ability to combat climate change. If the latest lawsuit is successful, it will spark a torrent of backlash from Republicans in Wisconsin. In the event they follow the example set by so-called leaders at the national level, they may simply choose to ignore any court decision. This case has national implications and we will keep our readers informed as it moves forward.

It has a large presence in the US, but also works withpartners in Europeas well as Singapore, Thailand, and India. In Europe, the company manages some of the continent’s largest depot charging operations, including V2G pilots in Germany and the Netherlands. Gregor Hintler, CEO of The Mobility House North America, toldElectriverecently the business case for charging systems comes with both opportunity and risk. While federal programs such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the EPA’s Clean School Bus Program, created during the Biden administration, helped boost the deployment of large-scale charging installations, these funds are now in jeopardy because the current administration deems them to be examples of fraud and waste. Hintler said most federally funded programs for EV infrastructure are being phased out, which will have significant consequences for public sector projects in the years to come. A small light in the darkness is the restoration of funds for the NEVI public charging program that was announced recently, although grudgingly. In Montgomery County in Maryland, The Mobility House is taking part in a signature microgrid project that Hintler says demonstrates how infrastructure can be future-proofed against policy reversals. The Brookville Smart Energy Bus Depot integrates solar panels, battery storage, gas generation, and ChargePilot smart charging software from The Mobility House. That installation combines two megawatts of solar capacity, a 4 megawatt-hour stationary storage system, and 56 charge points — 7 Heliox stations, two pantograph chargers, and four Proterra chargers. The entire operation is managed by the company’s ChargePilot platform that makes it possible for fleet operations to continue even during grid outages. Hintler views such projects as more than technical milestones. For him, microgrids are a political and economic statement. “This project represents resilience, not just operationally, but politically. It was designed to work independently of the grid, and that’s symbolic of where we see the market heading.” ChargePilot ensures dynamic load management, distributing available power based on each vehicle’s state of charge and departure schedule. If the depot switches to island mode with limited capacity, the software automatically prioritizes essential charging to maintain fleet operations The Mobility House is participating in multiple projects across North America. Its ChargePilot software is managing depot charging for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York City and its expanding fleet of electric buses. In California, the company supports theTurlock Unified School Districtnear San Jose, which operates electric buses with advanced load management to reduce grid impact. Hintler notes that these deployments demonstrate ChargePilot’s flexibility across different fleet types and grid contexts, fromschool districtsto major urban bus networks and airport shuttles. Although support for vehicle electrification is rapidly shrinking at the federal level in the US, progressive states like California, New York, and Massachusetts remain committed to their climate targets. It’s more of an uphill climb than it used to be, as federal initiatives such as the Advanced Clean Trucks and Advanced Clean Fleets initiatives are targeted for elimination. Hintler warns that repealing these regulations would eliminate fleet transition mandates, stalling market growth in affected states. “Most of the federally funded programs for EV infrastructure are being phased out. That’s not a projection—it’s a reality,” he says. However, sectors such as commercial logistics, waste management, and private shuttles remain economically viable for electrification without subsidies. That’s why The Mobility House is putting more emphasis on these resilient markets alongside public transit and school bus projects. Hintler notes that the economics of electrification in heavy-duty fleets are improving rapidly due to reduced battery costs, improved vehicle range, and operational savings on fuel and maintenance. In other words, Adam Smith’s unseen hand still trumps ideology and ignorance. But there is a subtext here as well. If Hintler is correct, any business model that is dependent on public financial or policy support has a potential flaw that could come back to bite it. Tesla is about to learn this lesson as payments for exhaust emission credits are reduced. The federal government no longer requires automakers to meet emissions standards or buy credits from others. That system has fed billions of dollars into the coffers at Tesla. The loss of that revenue will be significant, a reality that Tesla shareholders seem oblivious to. Despite public sector uncertainty, interest in expandingEV charging infrastructureby automakers and private fleet investment remains strong. Nearly $200 billion has been committed to EV and battery production domestically, with new factories coming online nationwide. Hintler believes that manufacturers often understate their progress publicly to avoid political backlash but remain fully committed to electrification strategies. “But behind the scenes, no one’s pulling back,” he says. This bifurcation between a cautious public sector and an assertive private sector demands strategic flexibility, Hintler believes. The Mobility House is making it a priority to work with fleet operators who can extract operational returns independent of grants. While school bus projects remain politically attractive, they are vulnerable to funding cuts. Waste collection, logistics, and private shuttle fleets are continuing their electrification plans regardless of changes in policy at the federal level. Technology must compensate for the lack of regulatory incentives and requirements, Hintler believes. Optimization using software tools becomes vital when electrification must stand on its own merits. Because of the flexibility of the ChargePilot platform — whether in grid-connected or microgrid-integrated mode — it makes certain that electric vehicles are charged efficiently regardless of policy shocks or grid constraints. For Hintler, the global reach of the ChargePilot platform reinforces a simple reality. Decarbonization is moving forward even if new bumps in the road have been added. The economics, manufacturing commitments, and international direction remain too strong to reverse. The challenge now is adaptation — designing solutions that work despite policy fragility. What is needed is strategic realism, he believes. The path forward is about resilience and integrating technological flexibility with market pragmatism. Projects such as Montgomery County’s microgrid show that The Mobility House is already building this future, one depot at a time. There is a larger lesson here, which is that the relationship between utility companies and their customers — whether residential or commercial — is changing. Because of the rise of renewables, battery storage, and software platforms, the day when those customers no longer need utility companies is on the horizon. It won’t happen this year or even this decade, but it will happen. The utility industry is founded on the bedrock idea that utilities have a social license to operate as monopolies, but if people and business can generate their own electrons, that policy support may become irrelevant. The only constant in life is change. Those who do not recognize the power of that maxim and who depend on government policies for their existence are always vulnerable to changes in those policies. It takes vision to be successful, something that The Mobility House has shown it has plenty of.

The clown car that used to be known as the US government has brought its oversized shoes down upon the US offshore wind industry once again. This time the victim is the Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island, brought to a screeching halt by order of the Interior Department even though it is already 80% complete. Connecticut is also impacted because it is a partner in the project. And, once again, a proposed multistate gas pipeline is lurking in the background. The Revolution stop-work ordertakes note of unspecified security concerns, which sounds rather mysterious if not downright sketchy. For some insights into the reasons for taking such an extreme measure, let’s take a quick look at the stop-work order that frozethe Empire Wind projectin New York State earlier this year. Empire is a project of the Norwegian diversified energy firm Equinor, and work was already well underway when the Interior Department brought the hammer down in April. The freeze was a temporary one. According to multiple reports, New York State Governor Kathy Hochul struck a bargain with the White House, and the proposedConstitution gas pipelinewas among the bargaining chips. Equinor’s status as a leading US oil and gas producer may have also factored into the de-freeze. As of this writing, work on Empire Wind is proceeding apace. As for the Constitution pipeline, it was first proposed by the firm Williams in 2014 with the aim of bringing gas from Pennsylvania into New York State, to connect with offtakers in New England. State environmental officials redlighted the project in 2016, but Williams hung in there for a few more years before officially dropping the proposal in 2020. Now, suddenly, here it comes again, magically brought back to life. Williams has other projects in the works throughout the US, and thebenefits of the new pipelineto consumers in New England are unclear. However, for reasons best known only to Williams, the Constitution pipeline is reportedly on the fast track to approval. The Revolution Wind stop-work order could be a temporary one as well. Though, that remains to be seen. Its developer, the Danish firm Ørsted, does not have US oil and gas investments to bargain with. However, there is a pipeline involved, and that’s where the Trump administration could apply some pressure on state officials in Rhode Island and Connecticut. The pipeline in question is Project Maple. It comes under the umbrella of the Canadian firm Enbridge. As described in a letter of opposition signed by dozens of environmental groups and community organizations in the region,Project Maple is a rebrandof the former Access Northeast project, in which Enbridge proposed another in a series of expansions on its existing, 1,100-mile Algonquin Gas Transmission Pipeline from Pennsylvania to points east. Enbridge mothballed Access Northeast back in 2017, but the project found its legs again in the form of Project Maple, shortly after the results rolled in from the 2024 Presidential election cycle. “Enbridge wants to expand its 1,100-mile-long natural gas pipeline system, the Algonquin Gas Transmission Pipeline,” the Conservation Law Foundation noted in an update on April 18. “This system runs from New Jersey through New York and into Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts,” CLF elaborated.“While the details are vague because this proposal is still in its early stages, we do know that Enbridge wants to replace existing pipelines, add new secondary pipelines, and expand compressor stations throughout the system’s route.” If you have reason to believe that Project Maple is the end game of the Revolution Wind stop-work order, drop a note in the comment thread. Before you do, though, consider that Enbridge is a Canadian company. Relations between the Trump administration and Canadian companies have become rather frayed of late, to put it mildly. Be that as it may, Pennsylvania is the nation’s second-largestproducer of natural gas, and US-based gas producers that operate in Pennsylvania have an interest in seeing Project Maple spread its branches. Besides, Enbridge is a pipeline owner and operator, not a construction firm. When Enbridge sets pipeline work in motion, the hands-on tasks are handled by the pipeline construction people, and that’s where things get interesting. Take a look over at Michigan, for example, where Enbridge seeks to replace its Line 5 oil and gas pipeline. The contractor on the project is the firmBarnard Construction, which is known for its billion-dollar work on Trump’s border wall.The Guardian is among the news organizations to pick up the Line 5 thread earlier this year. “Donald Trump’s administration is being accused by activists of a quid pro quo as it attempts to fast-tracka controversial fossil fuel pipelineproposal in Michigan that would in part be built by a donor with deep financial ties to the president,”The Guardiannoted in March, adding that “the contractor is Tim Barnard, who, along with his wife, gave $1m to Trump’s campaign last year.” Of course, this doesn’t mean that similar monkey business is afoot at Project Maple. It simply means that Enbridge does not appear to have suffered any political fallout from the hostilities sparked by the Trump administration’s tariff wars, at least for the time being. As for the US offshore wind industry, practically every state on the Eastern seaboard from Maine down to North Carolina has been banking on offshore wind to meet climate goals, stabilize fuel costs, and reduce their dependence on oil and gas shipped in from points west. Now the whole industry is in jeopardy as the Trump administrationputs the squeeze on the entire federal offshore lease programat one end, while monkey-wrenching Revolution Wind and other projects that have already started construction. States in “real America” are feeling the pain as well. Offshore wind advocates like to point out that offshore wind farms are vast, complicated infrastructure projects that createthousands of manufacturing jobsall over the US as well as portside jobs in their home states. The deep red state of Louisiana, for example, lent its offshore oil and gas expertise to construct the nation’s very first offshorewind farmin the US almost 10 years ago, and Louisiana businesses continued to make majorcontributions to the industryon through this year. Whelp, kiss that goodbye. It was only last year that Ørsted and the Louisiana shipbuilder Edison Chouest Offshore celebrated the launch of the first purpose-built offshore windconstruction vesselmade in the USA, the ECO Edison. That could be the last one Edison ever builds for the US market. Meanwhile, Ørsted hascomplied with the stop-work orderand is examining its options. Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont and Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee — both Democrats — havevowed to savethe project. Perhaps they should take a look over at Virginia, where theCoastal VirginiaOffshore Wind project is chugging merrily along, wrapped securely in the security blanket of support from Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin — for now.

With all necessary permits in place, wouldn’t its future seem secure? Nope. Citing “concerns that have arisen” during a review, the US Department of the Interior (DOI)has informedRevolution Wind, LLCthat it cannot resume any activities until so notified. The announcement threatens already tenuous wind alliances across commercial fishers, the offshore wind industry, environmentalists, clean power advocates, and investors. Revolution Wind, a subsidiary of Ørsted, is complying with the order and is “taking appropriate steps to stop offshore activities, ensuring the safety of workers and the environment.” TheØrsted visionis a world that runs entirely on green energy. In the August 22 Ørsted press release, the companydescribedhow Revolution Wind has 20-year power purchase agreements to deliver 400 MW of electricity to Rhode Island and 304 MW to Connecticut, “enough to power over 350,000 homes across both states to meet their growing energy demand.” The adjacent South Fork Wind, which uses the same turbine technology, “delivered reliable energy to New York at a capacity factor of 53% for the first half of 2025, on par with the state’s baseload power sources.” The project is located about 15 miles south of the Rhode Island coast and 32 miles southeast off the shores of Connecticut. Only a handful of offshore wind projects in the United Statesarestill under construction, including Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind, NY; Vineyard Wind near Martha’s Vineyard, MA; and the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, a Democrat, said the state was “evaluating all legal options to protect Connecticut’s interests.” Arguing that the Trump administration “wants to mothball billions of dollars in investment and cancel one of the best new sources of American-made, renewable energy,” Tong called out the President and his advisors for the harm they will cause to everyday consumers. “Trump and his enablers will own the resulting cost increases for ratepayers.” Tonghas joineda coalition of 19 attorneys general in filing a lawsuit against the Trump Administration over its unlawful attempt to freeze the development of wind energy. “With the significant investments made in this project already and its obvious benefit to our economy and climate,” RI Attorney General Peter F. Neronhaadded, “the Trump Administration’s attempt to halt it can only be characterized as bizarre.” Globally the offshore wind industryis ramping upfull speed ahead. On the other end of the energy spectrum, though, the Trump administration continues to do all it can to enhance the oil, gas, and coal industries. Theyare trying to haltpolicies in place that curb carbon emissions. They have reneged on federal grants, fired workers en masse, and attacked longstanding environmental regulations. They have frozen funds appropriated by Congress for clean energy projects and taken particular aim at wind energy, the country’s largest source of renewable power. They are promoting the dirtiest and most expensive fossil fuels in place of large offshore wind farms. Yet the untold story is about higher consumer utility rates, which are largely a result of higher demand. That demand, in turn, are being driven by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence, oil and gas drilling, space heating, and electrified forms of transportation,explainsRob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a DC-based energy consultancy firm. All of these technologies require extraordinary amounts of power. Offshore windcan reducethe need for peaker plants. In wholesale electricity markets, peak power costs set the price for the whole market. DOI deputy press secretary Aubrie SpadytoldtheDaily Caller(co-founded by Tucker Carlson) that people in the US don’t want or need renewable energy. “Americans deserve energy that is affordable, reliable, and built to last — not experimental and expensive wind projects that are proven failures. In line with President Donald Trump’s Energy Dominance Agenda, Interior is putting an immediate stop to these costly failures to deliver a stronger energy future and lower costs for American families. Like President Trump said, ‘the days of stupidity are over in the USA!’” Ahem. As is their norm, lies are more important for the Trump administration than data or peer-reviewed research. In 2025, many businesses face an insidious threat: the danger that the Trump administration will tell their company’s story faster, louder, or more convincingly than they do. And what’s become clear is the truth doesn’t matter. Executive orders now introduce policy uncertainty. Funding freezes lead to project delays. Investors retreat — as Marianne O’ConnoroutlinesinPR News, “not due to technological failings but because of politically driven narrative shifts.” This abrupt reversal rocked markets and cast doubt on the viability of wind power overall, illustrating how quickly external narratives can destabilize entire sectors. Offshore wind developers never fully grounded their story in rural revitalization, energy independence. or patriotism, O’Connor argues, and these are themes that might have defused political hostility. Another gap seems a deficit of relatable spokespeople, such as utility customers, turbine technicians, coastal business owners, or veterans retrained for green jobs — “who could retake the narrative and humanize the industry.” Instead of hyperbole, the nuances of offshore wind need to be explored. Despite the recent increase in offshore wind deployments, decision-making bodies have been making slow progress in measuring cumulative impacts. Expertsdescribehow: Several offshore wind advocacy groups have spoken out about the Trump halt to the Revolution Wind project. One is Climate Action RI, whichposteda message on social media criticizing the Trump administration’s action. “Revolution Wind is essential not only for our work to mitigate the climate crisis, but Rhode Island’s energy and economic future,” wrote Christian Roselund, clean energy policy analyst and “Yes to Wind” team leader. Liz Burdock, CEO of Oceantic Network,stated, “This dramatic action further erodes investor confidence in the US market across all industries and undermines progress on shared national priorities—shipyard revitalization, steel and port investments, and energy dominance.” Carolyn Fortuna, PhD, is a writer, researcher, and educator with a lifelong dedication to ecojustice.

Last year...", "full_text": "Last Updated on:24th August 2025, 12:10 am In a recent article on an uncharacteristically down July forBYD sales in China, my now colleagueJosé Pontesasked some pointed questions: Are we seeing “peak BYD”? “Peak PHEV”? A “succession crisis” for their most popular model? Having obsessively followed BYD for a while, I thought I could provide some perspective. The Song Plus was BYD’s best-selling vehicle and the best-selling vehicle in China overall in the first half of the year. BYD’s model lines are split into different series: the Dynasty series, with model names based on historical dynasties, and the Ocean series, with model names based on sea animals (or, previously, warships). These different series were typically sold at different dealerships. However, the Song Plus is an outlier, being sold at Ocean dealerships. At the end of July, BYD introduced theSealion 06. This is essentially the successor to the Song Plus, offered as a BEV and a PHEV. It was renamed to better fit the Ocean dealers that sell it. The Sealion 06 is a new car in China (not to be confused with the overseasSealion 6) on a new platform with more technology and better equipment, but with similar pricing. The BEV version is also stronger, with RWD and a frunk. Throughout July, Ocean dealerships were actively reducing Song Plus inventory to make way for the Sealion 06. Sealion 06 sales are still ramping up, and it has been rolling out to different markets within China throughout this month, such asHangzhouon August 7th,Beijingon August 10th, andGuangzhouon August 13th. However, initialreportsout of China already place it as the best-selling vehicle in its class and the second best-selling SUV, even before it was available throughout the country. As expected, BEV versions have been outselling PHEV versions. Combined with remaining sales of the Song Plus, which is essentially the previous generation, it is heading back to the top of the lists. BYD might keep selling the Song Plus alongside the Sealion 06 for a little while, like Ram did with the 1500 Classic, but I expect volume to shift to the new Sealion 06 in China. However, the Song Plus tooling is heading to overseas manufacturing plants, which recently started production or will soon. Uzbekistan started productionlast year, for example. And it is the best-selling NEV in other markets, likeTurkiye(as the Seal U), which also has amanufacturing plantscheduled to come online next year. The Song Plus’s days may be numbered within China, but it still has a future in global markets. In addition, other older models, particularly those based on the 4thGeneration DM-i platform, are seeing production shift overseas. The Song Pro is to be produced inBrazil, where it was thebest-selling NEVin the first half of this year. The Chaser/Destroyer, which used to show up on top selling vehicle lists in China, recently started production inThailand(to be sold under several other names). Overall, BYD has beeninvesting more in overseas manufacturing than at home. This may not be the company’s most advanced technology, especially in countries with technology sharing agreements, but it is a significant step up from competing products in those markets. And it is likely to fuel BYD’s global growth, which has been faster overseas than at home this year. Meanwhile, BYD hasn’t stopped developing PHEVs. The most recent news being a 10% reduction in fuel consumption for the 5thgeneration DM-i platform, created through an AI-enabled system optimization based on real-world usage data that was rolled out via an OTA update to new and existing vehicles. It is first being rolled out to the Qin L and Seal 06, reducing fuel consumption after the battery range runs out to 2.6l/100km (~90 mpg) NEDC. Even though this is an optimistic rating system, these midsized cars are rated as the most fuel-efficient under that system. Similar optimizations are to be rolled out to other vehicles, with more updates possible in the future, especially with new hardware. A 10% improvement from just a software update is pretty impressive when you really start thinking about it (biofuels have a smaller percentage impact, atabout 6%of US transportation fuel). Overall, the improved performance has the potential to stimulate PHEV sales in the short term and thus extend sales life, even if BEVs have the long-term advantage. In ameeting with dealers in China, Wang Chaunfu stated that BYD was in the process of reducing redundant models. We have become accustomed recently to BYD continuing old models while a multitude of new models are introduced. As models change and production shifts, there can be some temporary disruptions, but these changes are necessary to set up for the long term. Looking at August, based on preliminary discussions, I anticipate another transitional month in China, with the Sealion 06 still ramping up and other products shifting. September will be interesting. Overall, BYD’s sales are driven by product. New product is taking over while older product falls back. While factors likeBlack PRcan have some temporary influence, strong product tends to overcome it in the long term. Last year, BYD had stronger PHEV product introductions and sales. This year, BEVs have had stronger product introductions and sales. It is hard to be sure what next year will bring. More effort might go to product for outside markets, with growth shifting accordingly.

On one side, housing supply has failed to keep up with demand for decades. Affordability is slipping out of reach for many households, and the workforce that builds homes is aging and stretched thin. On the other side, buildings and construction remain a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Much of the public discussion has focused on operational energy, but a third of the climate problem in this sector is tied up in embodied carbon from materials like cement and steel. Those emissions are locked in before a single family or tenant ever moves into a unit. What is becoming clear is that there is one lever that can address both issues at once. Cross laminated timber, or CLT, combined with modular manufacturing, can industrialize housing while cutting embodied emissions at scale. The diagnosis — as always, I’m leveraging Rumelt’s kernel of good strategy — is straightforward. Canada’s annual housing completions hover around 240,000 to 270,000 units, while population growth points to the need for about 500,000 per year to stabilize affordability. Traditional site built construction is not delivering those numbers, and throwing more labor at the problem is not realistic given the shortages in skilled trades. At the same time, we continue to pour concrete and erect steel, cementing millions of tons of emissions in the process. These materials have a role in infrastructure, but they are overused in mid rise residential construction where other options are available. Housing delivery is slow, labor is scarce, and embodied carbon is ignored. That combination is unsustainable. The guiding policy is to treat housing like advanced manufacturing. Instead of bespoke site work, we should think of apartments and mid rise condos the way we think of cars or appliances. They can be produced in factories, standardized for safety and efficiency, and shipped as panels or modules to be assembled quickly. CLT is the core material that makes this possible. It is strong, light, renewable, and produced from trees that sequester carbon as they grow. Modular construction methods allow for site preparation and factory production to occur in parallel, compressing schedules by 30 to 50%. Taken together, CLT and modular turn the delivery of housing from a cottage industry into an industrial system. Mark Carney’s Build Canada Homes plan points in exactly this direction. It targets 500,000 homes per year, financed with low cost loans and equity for prefab builders, and supported by pattern book designs that can be stamped out repeatedly across sites. The Transition Accelerator’s mass timber roadmap sets capacity goals through 2030 and 2035 that align with this vision, calling for a million cubic meters of production by 2030 and doubling that five years later. The actions are not complicated, but they require commitment. Government must act as an anchor customer by issuing multi year offtake contracts for modular CLT housing. That gives factories the volume they need to operate efficiently and pay down capital investments. Pattern books of pre approved designs must be created so that every project does not start with a blank sheet of paper. Public and private finance has to flow into the build out of 10 to 12 large regional factories, each capable of producing panels and modules at the scale required. Finally, procurement rules must reward low carbon materials. If federal and provincial governments mandate embodied carbon targets for housing, CLT will be advantaged over concrete and steel, and private developers will follow suit. The data illustrates the point. A cubic meter of CLT stores roughly a ton of CO2 from the atmosphere, while producing it emits around 120 kilograms of CO2 from harvesting, drying, adhesives, and transport. That means net storage rather than net emissions. Replacing concrete and steel with CLT in mid rise apartments can cut embodied carbon by 15 to 40% depending on the design. Build times are compressed as well. A concrete structure often takes weeks per floor as forms are set, poured, and cured. A mass timber floor can be craned into place in days. Brock Commons, the 18 storey student residence at UBC, was built in less than ten weeks for the structural portion, a pace impossible with concrete. My long term forecasts for cement and steel demand through 2100 show both materials peaking much earlier than most mainstream models anticipate and then tapering steadily for the rest of the century. The reason is not a collapse of construction but a shift in what we build with. As infrastructure build outs in China and other emerging economies slow, and as advanced economies move into maintenance rather than expansion, the structural drivers of cement and steel demand weaken. At the same time, substitution pressures grow stronger. Cross laminated timber and other mass timber products are a central lever here. Every mid rise apartment or office built in CLT instead of reinforced concrete avoids both the cement in the slabs and the rebar that would have reinforced them. That substitution compounds over decades. In my projection curves, cement demand flattens and then declines to about half of today’s levels by 2100, while steel demand bends downward as electric arc furnaces dominate a smaller total market. CLT is not the only factor, but it is one of the most powerful and immediate ways to cut into the trajectory of the two most carbon intensive building materials we use. Canada’s opportunity is twofold. Domestically, meeting the 500,000 homes per year target is only possible if housing is industrialized with mass timber and modular methods. Internationally, demand for CLT is rising quickly in the United States, Europe, and Asia, and Canada has the forest resource and technical expertise to capture a large share of that market. The risks are also clear. If we fail to build factories, if insurance and code barriers remain unresolved, or if competitors move faster, Canada could miss the window. This moment in time will not repeat itself. Other countries are already scaling their mass timber industries. The argument for CLT and modular as Canada’s fastest lever is not speculative. It is grounded in the numbers on housing starts, embodied emissions, and build time compression. It is reinforced by policy commitments from the federal government and by industry roadmaps that chart the path to scale. The task now is to align policy, finance, and industry action so that Canada moves from demonstrations and pilot projects to a mainstream manufacturing system for housing. If we succeed, we will ease the housing crisis, cut embodied carbon, and establish a new advanced manufacturing sector that can compete globally. This series of articles will explore in depth how that transformation can be achieved, from Carney’s housing initiative to export strategy, from steel and cement demand shifts to decarbonizing the forestry supply chain, and from Indigenous led stewardship to investor economics.

The administration, led by true believers likeChris Wright, the current Energy Secretary, and Doug Burgum, the current Interior Secretary, likes to pooh pooh climate change. Recently, Wright acknowledged that climate change is happening, but claimed it is far from being the most serious challenge facing the United States. There are lots of other challenges — such as relegating Black and Brown people to their proper places and passing new Jim Crow laws to keep them there. Perhaps it is time to flip the script. Instead of yammering on about melting ice caps and starving polar bears — concepts that many people seem to have difficulty wrapping their heads around — maybe it is time to put the spotlight on the harm fossil fuels do to people. Here’s a handy example. Astudy published this weekin the journalScience Advancesclaims that extracting, transporting, refining, distributing, and burning fossil fuels causes at least NINETY THOUSAND premature deaths in the US every year. Why is that figure capitalized? Because if we just say “90,000,” there would be a tendency to skip right over the number and not internalize what it is telling us. [Editor’s note: As soon as I read it in all caps, I thought, “This is so much more impactful reading it like this. How brilliant of Steve!” —Zach] On September 11, 2001, a little over 3,000 people died in the attack on the Twin Towers. America went into a paroxysm of unfocused rage that cost the US some $3 trillion and saw more than 100,000 Iraqis killed — none of whom had the slightest connection to the horror of 9/11. Every year, more than 40,000 Americans die in automobile accidents. Even someone with my limited math skills knows that is more than the number of people who died on 9/11, but Americans seem to be impervious to the carnage taking place on the roads. They just buy bigger and heavier vehicles, plant a religious icon on the dashboard, and hope for the best. Now we know, thanks to this research, that 90,000 Americans — 20 times the number of deaths on September 11, 2001 — go to an early grave because of fossil fuel pollution every year. Perhaps if we seized on that information and publicized it aggressively, it would get people to pay attention to the carnage inflicted by our ongoing love affair with fossil fuels. The current climate change message is not getting through to quite a few people. Perhaps a change in tactics is in order? Here is the abstract to this groundbreaking research: The United States has one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries, yet the health impacts and inequities from pollutants produced along the oil and gas life cycle remain poorly characterized. Here, we model the contribution of major life cycle stages (upstream, midstream, downstream, and end-use) to air pollution and estimate the associated chronic health outcomes and racial-ethnic disparities across the contiguous US in 2017. We estimate life cycle annual burdens of 91,000 premature deaths attributable to fine particles, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. The research finds there are 10,350 pre-term births attributable to fine particulate pollution, 216,000 incidences of childhood-onset asthma cases linked to nitrogen oxide emissions (which have been characterized as subjecting human lungs to sunburn-like conditions), and 1,610 lifetime cancers attributable to hazardous air pollutants. It clearly illustrates that the burden of fossil fuel pollution falls primarily on non-whites. “Racial-ethnic minorities experience the greatest disparities in exposure and health burdens across almost all life cycle stages. The greatest absolute disparities occur for Black and Asian populations from PM2.5 and ozone, and the Asian population from NO2 and HAPs. Relative inequities are most extreme from downstream activities, especially in Louisiana and Texas.” The researchers at University College London and the Stockholm Environment Institute are the first to examine the health impacts and unequal health burdens caused by every stage of the oil and gas supply chain, from exploration to end use. “We’ve long known that these communities are exposed to such levels of inequitable exposure as well as health burden,” Karn Vohra, a postdoctoral research fellow in geography at University College London, toldThe Guardian. “We were able to just put numbers to what that looks like.” Their findings show that Indigenous and Hispanic populations are most affected by pollution from exploration, extraction, transportation, and storage; Black and Asian populations are most affected by emissions from processing, refining, manufacturing, distribution, and usage. The clearest example for that last finding is the people inSouth Memphiswho are breathing the detritus issuing from several portable methane generators powering xAI’s data center located in a former Electrolux factory. That neighborhood is predominantly Black. “What makes the study so valuable is how it dissects health impacts across the whole life cycle of oil and gas – from where it comes out of the ground to where it is combusted,” said Timothy Donaghy. He is the research director for Greenpeace USA and author of previous research on the racially uneven burdens of fossil fuel pollution. “As many studies have found before, these health burdens are not shared equally — a prime example of fossil fuel racism in action.” “What we found was striking. One in five preterm births and adult deaths are linked tofine particulate pollutionfrom oil and gas,” lead author Karn Vohra, formerly of the University College of London, toldThe Hill. “Even more concerning is that nearly 90 percent of new childhood asthma cases tied to nitrogen dioxide pollution were from this sector,” added Vohra, who is now at the University of Birmingham. Downstream effects have brought particularly dire health issues to Black communities in southern Louisiana — an area known as “Cancer Alley” — and in eastern Texas, the researchers found. The current administration gets apoplectic at the mention of diversity, equality, and inclusion policies, but the bald truth is that such areas have traditionally been “no go” zones for banks and other lenders, a practice known as redlining that has been in use since the 1930s. It has denied Black and other disadvantaged communities access to the capital needed to move away from industrial hot spots or high-traffic roadways. In addition, those communities lack the political power to oppose plans to add more oil, gas, and chemical operations in their neighborhoods. “These communities are already aware of this unjust exposure and the disproportionately large health burdens they experience,” senior author Eloise Marais, a geography professor at the University College of London, said in a statement reported byThe Hill. “Our study puts science-backed numbers on just how large these unfair exposures and health outcomes are,” she added. The data used for the study was collected in 2017, the most recent year for which a complete dataset is available. Because of the passage of time, the researchers stressed that their estimates are likely conservative. US oil and gas production has increased by 40 percent and consumption has risen by 8 percent since then. “Although our health burden results are overall conservative, these provide a foundation for future studies that could further refine quantification of disparities to support civil, community, andregulatory action,” they said. Eloise Marais toldThe Guardianshe hoped the study was “picked up by the kinds of community leaders and advocacy groups that are pushing for exposure to cleaner air. If there was a move away from reliance on oil and gas, we would experience the climate change benefits 50, 100, 200 years from today because the greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere so long, but communities would experience the health benefits immediately.” Reason enough to change the conversation. People have a hard time with abstract thinking, but how difficult is it to comprehend that 90 percent of new childhood asthma cases are linked to nitrogen dioxide pollution from oil and gas operations? Regardless of political orientation, most people will be shocked by that statistic, as well they should be. Forget about starving polar bears;let’s stop damaging the lungs of our children.

But, somehow Agriculture Secretary Brooke L. Rollins found a way. Last week she declared that banishing solar panels from two USDA loan programs will help save our vanishing farmlands. Farmland is disappearing faster than you can shake a stick at it, to be sure. Only … well … nope, solar panels are not the problem, not by a long shot. The numbers don’t lie. The US does indeed have a vanishing farmland problem. However, that’s not a solar panel problem. It’s an urban and suburban sprawl issue that has been swallowing up our nation’s agrarian past in a steady march for decade upon decade, far predating the solar industry of today. Anyone traveling the highways and byways of rural America for an extended period of time has witnessed the trend into the 21st century, with rows of crops replaced by rows of tract homes, warehouses, corporate campuses, and shopping malls. Solar panels, not so much. Take Tennessee, for example, where Rollins staged a press event to publicize her new directive. Farm conservationists list the state among those most at risk of losing land. However, the main culprit by far is real estate development, not solar panels. Nevertheless, in a press release explaining the new loan restrictions on wind turbines and solar panels, USDA stated: “Within the last 30 years, Tennessee alone has lost over 1.2 million acres of farmland and is expected to lose 2 million acres by 2027.” Wow, that’s a lot of farmland. And somehow this is connected to the loan restrictions for wind turbines and solar panels, right? Yes, that’s right, according to the USDA. “This problem is not just in Tennessee, since 2012, solar panels on farmland nationwide have increased by nearly 50%. That is why the Department is taking action,” the USDA continued in the next breath. Say what now? A 50% increase sounds pretty alarming, ermigod! Call out the National Guard! Round up the usual suspects! Two if by sea! The solar panels are coming! “Our prime farmland should not be wasted and replaced with green new deal subsidized solar panels. It has been disheartening to see our beautiful farmland displaced by solar projects, especially in rural areas that have strong agricultural heritage,” Rollins emphasized. Oh, Brooke, Brooke, Brooke. Where to begin with this? Let’s start with the numbers. As any school child knows, a 50% increase over practically nothing is still practically nothing. The real question is how much is practically nothing, and researchers at the University of Tennessee have the answers. They crunched the numbers in their state a couple of years ago and found that the total acreage taken up by utility-scale solar arrays, both in operation and under contract as of 2023, would take up only0.137% of farmland in the state, requiring somewhere in the range of just about 8,200–14,700 acres to produce a total of 1.474 gigawatts of solar energy. So much for the situation as of 2023. The researchers also took a look ahead to the coming years. They based their calculations on the rather ambitious goalpost of an additional 10 gigawatts of utility-scale solar energy set by the Tennessee Valley Authority. The TVA supplies electricity across six other states in addition to Tennessee. However, for the sake of argument, the research team based their calculation on all 10 gigawatts being located within Tennessee. The result? Still next to nothing. For an extra 10 gigawatts of clean energy from the sun, the state would have to give up another 0.52% to 0.93% of its farmland, taking into account new, more efficient solar panels that require less space to produce more energy than those installed in previous years. So, what happened to the rest of those 1.2 million acres that Rollins is so concerned about, to say nothing of the additional acres she expects Tennessee to lose over the coming years? Again, the answer is staring anyone in the face who spends any time at all driving around rural America for any amount of time. “From 1997 to 2017, Tennessee’s land in farms decreased from 11.99 million acres to 10.87 million acres, a reduction of 1.11 million acres or about 9% of Tennessee’s farmland,” the University of Tennessee researchers observed. Sure, go ahead and blame the US solar industry for the loss of 1.11 million acres of farmland in just 20 years, because solar developers were so very, very busy papering over the farms of Tennessee with solar panels from 1997 to 2017 — except, not. As of midway through last year, the state barely had600 megawatts of installed solar capacityunder its belt, including rooftop solar panels and other non-farm installations. The conservation organizationAmerican Farmland Trusthas also been tracking the vanishing farmland trend. In 2020, they issued a state-by-state report in which they listed Tennessee as the 4th-most threatened state in the US due to the loss of agricultural land topoorly planned real estate development(emphasis added). The urban sprawl visible from highways is just part of the problem. AFT analyzed 660,000 acres of agricultural land lost in Tennessee between 2001 and 2016. Approximately 78% was replaced or restricted by LDR (low density residential) development. Aside from the direct loss of farmland, AFT noted that the encroachment of both conventional sprawl and low density development drives up nearby land prices. Retiring farmers in those areas are more likely to sell their land to non-farmers who can afford to pay more. “This means that new and beginning farmers have a hard time finding land, threatening the very future of agriculture,” AFT emphasized. The real estate-related bleeding continues to this day, with Rutherford County among the hotspots in Tennessee where local land use planners are facinga torrent of oppositionfrom “home builders, real estate professionals and developers.” If the planners do manage to save some farms, it’s a day late and a dollar short. Rutherford County lost22,044 acres of farmlandbetween 2014 and 2023. Like her boss in the Oval Office, Rollins lives in alternative reality where actual problems don’t exist, and neither do their solutions. How else to explain the misdirection on solar panels? “Subsidized solar farms have made it more difficult for farmers to access farmland by making it more expensive and less available,” Rollins asserted last week, blithely ignoring every fact and figure about real estate sprawl and population growth. As if the misdirection on solar panels and real estate was not enough, Rollins and her coterie of state officials at last week’s event also conflated small-scale solar arrays with the kind ofutility-scale solar developmentthat anti-solar foes love to complain about. At the very tail end of a very long press release, USDA finally cut to the chase and named the two loan programs in question: the Rural Development Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan Program and the Rural Development Rural Energy for America Program Guaranteed Loan Program. Restricting solar panels from these two programs won’t stop farmers from leasing their land to solar developers for utility-scale solar power plants. Government solar loans and private solar leases are two entirely different and separate transactions. Instead, Rollins has only made it more difficult for farmers to afford the up-front cost of small solar arrays for their own use, on a scale consistent with the barns, sheds, silos and heavy machinery that characterize the agricultural operation of today.

In the last 20 years, installations have become bigger and cheaper. My solar array was only 1.9 kWh and cost about AU$6000. For much less, you can now get an array 3 times the size. However, at the same time as arrays have gotten bigger and cheaper, the feed-in tariff (FIT) for solar power has become miniscule. Whereas two decades ago the FIT was around 50¢ a kWh, now you are lucky to get 8¢. What to do with all that power in the middle of the day? The answer is a home battery. Prices on these have fallen, and there has been an increasing number of solar panels + batteries installed — but not nearly as fast as necessary to create high demand. The Australian federal government offers itsCheaper Home Batteriessubsidy. 30% off — what a bargain! AU$2.3 billion is on offer to subsidize the installation of small-scale battery systems (5 kWh–100 kWh) for households, businesses, and community organisations. Come and get it! And have they ever. There have been 11,500 applications for the scheme in its first 3 weeks of operation. No wonder Tesla is sending me an email every second day advertising the Powerwall. Sadly, I bought a home battery several years ago and paid twice the price for out-of-date tech. The subsidy will be reviewed at least annually and “will gradually decrease until 2030, in line with reducing battery prices.” As it should. Many households with an existing solar array are putting in batteries. According to theMelbourne Age, small-scale battery systems equivalent to South Australia’s Tesla Big Battery are being added to the grid every 8.7 days. The scheme has been in operation for about 2 months now, with Australians installing 15 MWh worth of batteries a day. A thousand batteries a day! This is five times the average in 2024. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) had predicted that this would not have been achieved even by 2035. Once again, the market is showing up professional crystal ball gazers. Is this a second revolution in home electricity? The government expects that participating households, businesses, and community organisations will be able to “reduce electricity bills by making the most of cheap and clean solar power by storing it for when it is needed.” Not only will Australians be able to use solar to power their homes during peak hours, they may even have some excess to sell back onto the grid when the prices are high. Some are predicting a return on investment in about four years. Does this mean the end of thesolar duck, or at least reduction of the solar duck? It should mean that there will be much less need for expensive gas (methane) turbines in the evening peak. Tristan Edis, director ofGreen Energy Markets,makes this salient point: “You don’t need swarms of lawyers, merchant bankers, accountants, environmental planning, people, community consultation, all the things that go into building large-scale renewables. You don’t need any approvals. You don’t need any engineers; you just need your local sparky.” At the current rate of installation, within five years, Tristan hypotheses’ that there would be 10,000MW of battery capacity installed. “That’s a big deal when you think we have 20,000MW of coal capacity [in Australia],” he adds.“[D]emand for batteries has gone nuts.” The Australian government is reviewing its emission reduction targets out to 2035. The massive uptake of home batteries and the implications it has for the grid mean that these targets could be more “ambitious.” “With existing state and territory action expected to deliver emissions cuts of between 66 per cent and 71 per cent by 2035, these findings show the Albanese government should be striving for a science-aligned target of 80 per cent [reductions] by 2035,” Australian Conservation Foundation CEO Kelly O’Shanassy said. The managing director of solar consultancy SunWiz, Warwick Johnston, said that prior to the Cheaper Home Batteries scheme, four rooftop solar arrays were being installed for each battery. Now it is one for one. The Clean Energy Regulator data show that the majority of installations (40%) are in New South Wales. Queensland has 20%, South Australia 17%, and Victoria 12%. Homeowners in NSW can also claim an extra subsidy if they connect to a virtual power plant (VPP). What about encouraging all applicants for the subsidy to be part of a VPP? That would make sense.Looks like it’s covered…. “To qualify for the battery rebate, an on-grid battery system — including its inverter — must have the technical capability to participate in a VPP, giving the consumer the option to join a VPP either at installation or in the future … consumers who choose to participate will need an ongoing internet connection. Depending on the inverter model and site conditions, additional hardware or software and permissions for site controllers to access multiple battery systems may be required, and battery retailers must inform consumers about any such requirements.” Many of my Facebook friends are installing the maximum numbers of Powerwalls allowable. I hope to bring you their stories in future articles. Like many others, they are hungry for solutions to high energy costs, and maybe they will make a little hay while the sun shines. And you never know when the next flood will come and wash away the power lines, or the next fire will burn the power poles down, orthe next cyclone will blow down the high-tension towers. This is Australia, and we are in the middle of the climate crisis.It never hurts to have a battery backup. Now, hopefully the next penny will drop. If my home battery saves me money (and doesn’t burst into flames), then it is just possible that an electric car will save me more money and will also not be flammable. After all, it is generally the same chemistry. I am hoping that this surge in home battery installations will reduce the FUD around electric vehicles and bring about a surge in the numbers of EVs on the road. Watching this massive uptake, I am wondering if it is only the price point that matters? For many Australians, the future is now more affordable and more electric.

Water reacts with iron rich magnesium and iron rich, silica poor igneous rock — ultramafic — from Earth’s mantle rocks to release hydrogen, and with the right chemistry and temperature you can raise reaction rates and collect a clean product. In the lab and in models this pathway looks promising. In the field it asks for the same muscles that shale, tight gas and enhanced geothermal developed over years. You need reliable drilling, completions, stimulation, reservoir monitoring and production operations. You also need an offtaker next door that wants steady molecules for decades. That is where the real world starts to pinch. Just as withmicrobial hydrogen underground technologyI looked at recently, what works in the lab starts to look like nonsense in the field. The geology is not where the rigs and frac spreads live. The densest service capacity in North America sits over the Permian, Eagle Ford and other shale basins. Ultramafic belts are common on maps but not in those corridors. Serpentinites — hydrated ultramafic rocks made mostly of chrysotile, lizardite, and antigorite — and ophiolites — slices of oceanic crust and upper mantle thrust onto land by tectonics —show up along the California Coast Ranges, parts of the Appalachians, pieces of the Midwest and scattered blocks in the Intermountain West. There are small overlaps in places like Four Corners or parts of Kansas and Michigan, but the center of gravity for people, pumps and suppliers is hundreds to thousands of kilometers away from many of the most prospective rocks. That distance adds cost, schedule risk and learning friction. It also increases the chance that crews cycle in and out rather than staying long enough to build a stable craft for this very specific job. Offtakers are not where the rocks are either. Methanol capacity in the United States clusters on the Gulf Coast because gas is cheap, pipelines are thick and ports are close. Ammonia looks similar, with a big Louisiana footprint and a secondary band in the Plains and Midwest to serve fertilizer demand. A world scale ammonia plant needs on the order of 176,000 tons of hydrogen per year, and a world scale methanol plant needs on the order of 200,000 tons per year. If your hydrogen source sits beside those plants you can move gas a few kilometers to a header, purify it and feed the process. If the source sits a long way from the fence line you have built a second business that must move a low density gas across long distances, or you must convert it to another carrier. That erodes the simple “field to flange” narrative that makes engineered mineral hydrogen look tidy on paper. The physics and chemistry set tight conditions that must be met and kept. Hydrogen generation is strongest when water reacts with ferrous iron to become magnetite, releasing hydrogen, which works best at a few hundred degrees Celsius. If the rock is cooler, reaction rates drop. If rust-like coatings cover the reactive rock surface, the reaction slows down. If fractures short circuit flow so that water bypasses fresh surface, rates drop. Hydrogen purity matters because surface plants become large and power hungry when they must pull hydrogen out of dilute streams. Microbes in the subsurface can consume hydrogen and lower purity. The fluids can be very alkaline, which is rough on cement and some steels. Hydrogen is tiny, diffusive and can embrittle some alloys. Every one of those issues has a mitigation, but none are yet proven at the scale and duration that offtakers and lenders require. Sustained deliverability is a hard gate. Techno economic studies often use a per well target around 175 to 200 kg of hydrogen per hour at the wellhead, with purity at or above about 65%. That is roughly 4.2 to 4.8 tons per day. Held for 20 years, one well would deliver on the order of mid tens of thousands of tons. That is a lot of rock to contact. Back of the envelope calculations using literature yields of a few kilograms of hydrogen per cubic meter of fully reacted peridotite — olivine with some pyroxene — imply that a single successful well must sweep many millions of cubic meters of reactive volume over its life. That is feasible if fracture networks stay open and if stimulation accesses new surface over time. It is not feasible if the system gets covered by a thin, stable film—like iron-oxide or carbonate — early, if the fractures close or if operations short circuit flow. The analogy to shale is not perfect, but it is instructive. Shale wells show high initial rates and then steep declines because the accessible pressure and surface area close to the well get used up. Operators hold field level output by constantly drilling new laterals and adding stages, not by expecting single wells to sit on plateau for decades. An engineered hydrogen field would need its own version of that playbook, with planned step outs, staged access to new rock and periodic maintenance interventions, all while keeping chemistry and purity in bounds. Getting to that level of operational maturity takes many at bats in a short time. Shale scaled because thousands of wells across a few big basins let teams learn fast. Fluids, proppants, stage spacing, diverters and diagnostics improved because service companies worked every week in the same places and swapped ideas at the coffee truck. Engineered mineral hydrogen does not have that runway. The United States likely has only dozens of Tier 1 prospects when you demand the full system of source rock, reservoir and seal at accessible depth. The world likely has hundreds. Many sit in regions with limited oilfield services or with policies that constrain hydraulic stimulation. You can import spreads for a hub, and one hub with 80 to 120 wells is large enough to keep a crew busy for months, but a sparse map of projects slows the learning loop. That keeps costs high, cycle times long and confidence low for longer than offtakers can tolerate. The location of demand and the structure of incentives also tilt the field. Blue hydrogen is not new chemistry. It is reforming or partial oxidation of natural gas paired with capture and storage of carbon dioxide. It lives where gas lives, which is often the same place methanol and ammonia plants already sit. It connects to existing hydrogen pipelines and to salt cavern storage in some regions. It uses standard compressors and purification blocks. Policy in many countries supports carbon capture with long lived credits or contracts for difference. Policy for clean hydrogen sometimes supports any low carbon source, sometimes adds strict lifecycle accounting rules and sometimes narrows the window for project starts. In gas rich regions the mix of plant locations, pipeline access and policy support tends to make blue hydrogen easier to bank. The spread between modeled engineered mineral hydrogen costs and blue hydrogen costs is not large. Small misses on flow rate or purity can erase it. Lenders look at that spread and see risk. Regulation matters as much as geology and cost. Some states have broad restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, and many jurisdictions in Europe do as well. That does not stop all forms of stimulation, but it adds time and uncertainty. Electrical reservoir stimulation is promising and avoids some of the issues that drive water based fracturing opposition, but it still requires deep wells, high voltage equipment, rigorous monitoring and a receptive regulator. Developers can thread those needles in a few places, but it is not a recipe for fast replication across many basins. A development model that depends on new offtake plants standing up beside first of a kind subsurface systems in jurisdictions that are learning on the job is a hard sell. It is fair to ask what would have to be true for engineered mineral hydrogen to deserve plant scale offtake. The list is short and clear. A field trial would need to hold per well rates at or above the target with stable purity for a year, not a month. It would need to show that chemical or thermal maintenance restores performance when passivation or microbes drag it down. It would need to show that restimulation can reach new rock from the same pad without losing containment or purity. It would need to run a small hub of several dozen wells into a plant header and prove that the gathering, compression and purification work at scale without surprise outages. It would need to do all of that in a place where policy is steady and where service depth is real, and it would need to line up an offtaker that is willing to sign for 15 to 20 years. That is a tall stack. It is not impossible, but it is rare in extraction history for new subsurface systems to jump straight to bankable on the first or second try. There are glimmers of hope for some of this. Utah Forge and Fervo are experimenting with fracturing hard crystalline rock for enhanced geothermal, whichmy assessmentsuggests is a field rife with black swans. There might be some transferability from that to engineered mineral hydrogen. But it doesn’t move the skilled resources or the methanol and shale plants to the good ultramafic zones. Firms pursuing engineered mineral hydrogen include Vema Hydrogen, Halliburton, EXLOG, and Eden GeoPower, each working to stimulate water–rock reactions in ultramafic formations to produce hydrogen at scale, and a couple are big established oilfield services companies, presumably trying to find something to do with their kit and people with the decline of shale oil and gas looming, and in factalready pinching this year. None of this writes off the underlying chemistry. Water rock reactions make hydrogen naturally. Ultramafics are common worldwide. Small pilots are worth doing well, with careful measurement and open publication of results. There is a possible path where engineered mineral hydrogen fills niche markets, proves out a handful of rock types and develops a small but capable service craft. The claim that it will anchor world scale ammonia and methanol offtake in the next investment cycles needs more than promise. It needs long, clean data and a simple story for crews, plants and regulators in the places we actually build things. And, of course, the premise that dozens of good sites in the US and hundreds globally might turn into a new energy source should be treated as ludicrous hyperbole. In a world arranged differently this could look better. If ultramafic belts sat under the Gulf Coast and if ammonia and methanol plants were scattered across those belts, the learning curve might be short and the offtake risk small. In the world we have, the rigs and crews are in shale regions. The big chemical plants are near gas hubs and ports. Many of the ultramafic targets are somewhere else. Fracking ultramafic rock economically will take many cycles of trial and error, and there are not enough project sites in friendly places to climb that curve fast. The economics between engineered mineral hydrogen and blue hydrogen are close, and the policy and regulatory picture pushes capital toward blue in the same corridors. That combination makes first of a kind engineered mineral hydrogen hubs with long term offtake unlikely to reach bankability soon, if ever. If a developer proves otherwise with sustained rates, steady purity and a contract next door, that would be a welcome result. Until then, the prudent read is that engineered mineral hydrogen might be technically and economically viable in another world, and that in this one it faces a map and a market that point to a different outcome. is a climate futurist, strategist and author.

I used to drive a first generation Nissan Leaf that had a 24kWh battery, so I am always fascinated to see plug-in hybrids (PHEV) with larger batteries. An example of this is the new Chery Tiggo 9 Super Hybrid PHEV that Chery says is a “masterful synthesis of plug-in hybrid innovation and exquisite design artistry.” This model, known as the Tiggo 9 CSH Vanguard, has a 34.4kWh battery pack, but Chery also has the 18.3kWh Tiggo 9 CSH Pinnacle. The Vanguard has a stated range of 160km in EV mode and 1,400km combined with the 1.5L turbo engine. The Pinnacle has a stated range of 90km in electric mode. The Pinnacle starts from R839,900, and the Vanguard starts from R989,900. The Chery Group, and its brands that include Omoda, Jaecoo, and Jetour, is doing extremely well in the overall South African market and is up to fourth place in July 2025, only behind Toyota, Suzuki, and Volkswagen. Legacy automakers with a presence in South Africa have been very slow to introduce plug-ins. Chery, on the other hand, has taken the initiative among the newer brands in the country to introduce plug-in hybrids. There are a growing number of plug-in hybrids with electric ranges above 100km that are now being offered in South Africa by these Chinese manufacturers, and these seem to be winning over some consumers. Among the Chinese brands, Chery appears to be leading this transition, offering plug-in hybrids at reasonable prices, and the South African market seems to be responding well to this. These offer consumers more value than the older generation PHEVs from some other markets that had electric ranges of less than 40km in real driving conditions. A lot of people commute between Pretoria, Centurion, Midrand, and Johannesburg, and PHEVs with a real range of over 90km will offer great value. A lot of people now also have solar at home, and charging these PHEVs with solar makes the value proposition financially stronger. Thanks to Chery & Co, there are more PHEV options with decent all-electric range available now in South Africa, and this could be one of the main reasons driving the growth in sales, whereas a few years ago, the few PHEV models available mostly had real electric ranges of around 50km and below. So with a claimed range of 160km in electric mode, this Tiggo 9 Vanguard should do well. Its more premium cousin, the Omoda C9, has a similar sized battery pack (34.46kWh) and a range of 150km, which is close to the Chery Tiggo 9. The Omoda C9 is priced from R999,000 and has been well received in South Africa. This should give an indication of how well the Tiggo 9 could do in South Africa. The Vanguard has motors giving a combined output of 455 kW. The torque is listed as 920 Nm. As more PHEVs enter the South African market, let’s take a look at the overall market and see the current state of the market. Vehicle Sales In South Africa From January to June 2025 As shown in the table above, vehicle sales in the overall market were up 14% YoY in the first 6 months of 2025. 278,890 vehicles were sold in South Africa in the first 6 months of the year. 97.4% of those were full ICE vehicles followed by plug-less HEVs with 2%. PHEVs had a market share of just 0.28% and BEVs had a market share of only 0.2%. Looking at the YoY performance, HEVs were down 6%, BEVs also took a heavy knock, down 24% YoY. PHEV sales experienced explosive growth, albeit from a very small base. PHEVs were up a whopping 162%. With more companies, especially the Chinese automakers, launching longer range PHEVs, sales of PHEVs look set to grow even further in the second half of the year. Legacy automakers should look at this trend carefully. Let’s look at Toyota, for example. Toyota South Africa appears to be favoring plug-less hybrids (HEV) over PHEVs. A look at the sales for H1 2025 supports this. From January 2025 to June 2025, Toyota South Africa sold a whopping 4,257 HEVs and only 4 plug-in hybrids. Yes, just 4 plug-in hybrids. The 4 were all Toyota Rav 4 PHEVs. Which is a real shame, as the PHEV Rav 4 is doing quite well in other markets around the world and it has decent electric range from its 18.1kWh battery. On the flipside, Toyota sold 521 Rav 4 HEVs. That’s a lot of HEVs compared with the PHEVs sold. The other popular HEV during this period was the Toyota Corolla Cross and it sold 3,374 units in the first 6 months of 2025. Toyota could singlehandedly boost the plug-in market in South Africa if it actually tries to promote them more. Toyota is the number one brand in South Africa by a significant margin. Also the PHEV Rav 4 has an 18.1kWh battery, similar to the Chery Tiggo 9 Pinnacle, however, Chery also offers a longer range Vanguard with a 34kWh battery pack. Something for Toyota to learn from Chery. HEV sales (dominated by Toyota South Africa) fell 6% in the first 6 months of 2025 in an overall vehicle market that is up 14% and PHEVs up 162%. Perhaps it’s time for Toyota to relook at its strategy for plug-ins in this market. Driving around South Africa you see prominent billboards of PHEVs like Chery Group’s Omoda C9. There are automakers going all out to promote PHEVs over HEVs and I think this messaging will grow and have a huge impact on adoption. These kinds of longer range PHEVs could just be what could help win over a huge percentage of the population that may still not be too sure about going all-electric. They could do most of their daily drive in electric mode and use the ICE component on longer trips. Chances are they will see that going all-electric is a better option and switch to BEV on their next purchase. This new generation of PHEVs could be the transition vehicles PHEVs were thought to be in the beginning. Remeredzai Joseph Kuhudzai has been fascinated with batteries since he was in primary school.

Their awnings are much like a traditional roll-up shade awning for RVs, but with integrated, flexible solar panels that are designed to withstand the rigors of RV life and the wide range of weather conditions that come with it. The awnings can be sized widthwise by adding more of the roll up flexible panels to the awning to extend it further. They showcased a typical awning at RE+ with three of their roll-up solar panels integrated into it for a rated output of 800-900 watts of solar in ideal conditions. As an awning, Eco-dynamic’s offering delivers, with motorized action and integrated LED lighting which makes setting up camp that much easier. In addition, it provides invaluable shade while putting in some extra work to produce electricity for your auxiliary battery system at the same time. Because the awnings are built with Eco-dynamic’s flexible roll-up solar panels, they can be custom sized to suit the physical dimensions desired for the awning. Functionally, the solar awning would replace the awning typically found on the side of larger RVs, but with the added benefit of putting out power while it sits in the sun. It’s a great combination that makes it easy for RV owners or others looking to add a motorized awning to their build. Looking farther ahead into the future, it’s not hard to imagine a solar awning pushing power directly into the traction battery of a fully electric RV. 1,000 watts of additional solar production isn’t going to replace a DC fast charger anytime soon, but it’s clearly a meaningful amount of output for any electric vehicle. As of today, these solar panels are primarily designed to be used to charge the house battery and would not be well suited to directly charge an electric vehicle. This is primarily due to the lack of a DC to DC mppt charger that would make good use of the solar. Eco-dynamic’s core technology is the flexible roll-up solar panels that are used in the awnings, but they also make them in a wide range of sizes. They offer panels starting with a portable roll-up 40 watt solar panel that could be used on a backpacking or camping trip to keep your device charged up. Ramping up, they have a 220 watt roll-up panel that can be used in an awning configuration, as well as a larger 300 watt roll-up solar panel which was being used in their awning on display. These can be purchased as standalone solar panels or in a fully built awning. Eco-dynamic primarily sells systems directly to RV manufacturers, trailer builders, and the like. They are currently selling their 800 watt “Artpiece for RV” motorized awningon their websitefor $3,799. For more information about Eco-dynamic’s solar awnings head over totheir official website.

NASA also has two technologies in the works that researchers have identified as keys to unlocking the riches of space-based solar power. Still, the odds are against the US playing a significant role in the global space solar race, considering the topsy-turvy state of affairs over at the White House, where US President Donald Trump lives rent-free in a grass-covered, gold-plated world of his own invention. Grass has been much in the news this week, after the President touched upon the subject during a live television appearance in Washington, DC. However, let’s get to the latest space solar news first. Space-based solar power refers to technology that enables solar energy to be beamed down from the Sun to Earth on a 24/7 basis, regardless of the weather or time of day. Thetechnology piecesare at hand and the field is attractinginvestor interestas well as government support, with Europe, China, and Japan among the hotspots (see more space solarbackground here). Here in the US, the Department of Energy continues to providelip serviceto space solar on its website, but the action steps are spread among multiple federal agencies, all of which are subject to the whims of a Commander-in-Chief who appears to be increasingly out of touch with his surroundings. Returning to the topic of space solar, though, let’s be fair. If the President or anyone else in a position of authority suddenly began talking about space solar just a few years ago, they may have easily sparked a dementia alert on social media. The renowned US author Isaac Asimov popularized the idea of sending concentrated beams of solar energy down to Earth from outer space back in the 1940s, but even well into this century the goal of freeing the Earth from the on the on-again, off-again vagaries of ambient sunlight seemed far out of reach. Much water has passed under the bridge since 2011, when the philanthropists Donald and Brigitte Bren kickstarted action in the US space solar field with a donation to CalTech totalingmore than $100 million. “Northrup Grumman chipped in$12.5 million for several years, and thethe US Air Forceandthe US Navyhave also been exploring the space solar field,”CleanTechnicanoted last year. Leading up to this year, US Department of Energy has also played a key role through its support for perovskite solar cell research, among other fields. Last year NASA took stock of the situation and noted that their currentportfolio of activitiesincluded wireless power beaming among other supportive technologies, though direct funding for specific space-to-Earth activity was not in the cards. With NASA and DOE joining other federal agencies under the Trump chopping block, the odds are against further action on the part of the US government, at least for the time being. That leaves the field wide open for other nations to pile on, and a newly published study from a research team at King’s College London has just added fuel to the fire. “Space-based solar panelscould enable solar power to be harvested continuously instead of only when sunlight reaches Earth, reducing Europe’s need for Earth-based wind and solar by 80%,” Kings College explains. The study was published in the peer-reviewed journalJouleunder the title, “Assessspace-based solar powerfor European-scale power system decarbonization.” Of course there’s a catch, and that’s where NASA comes back into the picture. Kings College notes that if space solar is to play a significant role in Europe’s 2050 decarbonization goal, two of NASA’s supportive technologies must be called into action, the Innovative Heliostat Swarm and the Mature Planar Array. Neither one is in a ready state at this time. “The heliostat design is in the early stages of development but has higher potential to continuously capture solar energy, whereas the simpler planar array is closer to being technologically ready but can only capture solar energy around 60% of the time,” Kings College observes. Even 60% of the time sounds a lot better than the limited availability of sunlight on Earth, but the numbers don’t work out economically, which leaves the Innovative Heliostat Swarm to hold the torch. Based on costs projected by NASA, the Kings College team assessed that the heliostat design would outperform both wind and terrestrial solar by 2050. “Overall, the model estimated that the heliostat design would reduce total system costs by 7%–15%, offset up to 80% of wind and solar, and reduce battery usage by over 70%, though hydrogen storage would still be vital in the winter months for some regions,” the school summarized. Still, Mature Planar Array fans need not lose hope. The research team supports the idea of deploying near-term technological readiness as a stepping stone to longer-term solutions. Whether or not any of NASA’s space solar technology is available to anyone, anywhere, is up to the Commander-in-Chief. However, the current priority of the day appears to be grass, grass, and more grass. The urgent need for grass was on full display on Thursday, when the President went on live television to speak about the crisis in Washington, DC. Or not, as the case may be. Whether it was a simple failure to read the room, additional evidence of a slide into dementia, or something else entirely, the President — who recently ordered the Rose Gardengrass to be replaced with stone— used the occasion to pledge a soup-to-nuts makeover of all the parks in Washington, DC with brand new grass, and not just any old new grass. In widely reported remarks, he promised a leveling up to the standard of a Trump National Golf Club, such as it is (for the record, there is more than one Trump National Golf Club in the US). Thursday’s rumination upon grass was more than a little off-topic considering the chaotic state of affairs in the nation’s capitol, where a Soviet-style takeover of the local police department is well underway complete with military occupiers helicoptered in from at least four states —Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina — that tried and failed to take DC by force all the way back in 1860. Whelp, second time’s a charm. Nevertheless, the President insisted on drawing attention to, of all things, grass. “We’re going to bere-grassing all your parks, all brand new sprinkler systems, the best that you can buy,” the President said. “I know more about grass than any human being I think anywhere in the world,” he continued, adding that grass “has a life. You know that? Grass has a life. We have a life, and grass has a life.” Image: Space solar technology could provide the Earth with24/7 power, regardless of the weather or the season (via CalTech).

The latest sign of fresh activity involves a new collaboration between the leading online solar marketplace EnergySage, the software-enabled buyer’s guide WattBuy, and the EV charging firm Qmerit. All three are now joined in the building decarbonization movement under the umbrella of the sprawling legacy firm Schneider Electric. The all-electric building of the future began to emerge in the early 20th century, but the journey to mass adoption has been long and slow. Most US households continue to burn gas, oil, propane, or wood for heat and hot water, with electricity pulling duty for other appliances. As of 2020, only 26% of US households usedelectricity as their one and only energy source, and most of them are concentrated in warm-climate states to the south. There’s a good reason for that. Electricity is a pricey way to run a heating system compared to natural gas and other fuels. Still, the building electrification movement has been growing in recent years with an assist from 21st century technologies including heat pumps as well as solar panels, energy storage, and electric vehicles. Innovation on the developer side also support the building electrification movement, with newmodular construction systemsamong the examples. Advocates also like to point out thatall-electric buildingsspare developers from the additional expense of arranging for gas connections. For that matter, some jurisdictions have forced the issue by placing outright bans on new gas hookups. Schneider Electric has been working on the three-way collaboration for several years, having previously formed a partnership with Qmerit and acquiring EnergySage. The acquisition of WattBuy, announced earlier this week, rounds out the decarbonization mission. “The acquisition will strengthen Schneider Electric’s ability to simplify and accelerate the energy transition for U.S. homeowners,” Schneider explained in a press statement. You can say that again.WattBuybrings a potential reach of more than 100 million households to the collaboration through its relationships with the home ownership stakeholders Redfin, Veterans United Home Loans, and Opendoor among others. Redfin, for example, has partnered with WattBuy to provide potential home buyers with an estimate of a home’s monthly electricity bills. WattBuy recommends electrification strategies for individual buildings through a free portal on their website. All they need is a street address (or zip code, if preferred), and they will provide company-specific recommendations for rooftop solar and storage systems among other electrical appliances. They also identify any available demand-response plans and community solar systems opportunities. Try ithere. EnergySage is a transparency-focused online marketplace that enables ratepayers to compare products and vendors without reinventing the wheel, and Qmerit brings its top-rated EV charger installation services to the mix. “Combined with EnergySage’s trusted marketplace and Qmerit’s national service network, Schneider Electric now offers an unmatched digital and physical pathway for electrifying the home,” Schneider explains. “This acquisition underscores Schneider Electric’s commitment to decarbonization at the grid edge and to delivering simple, scalable tools that accelerate the energy transition for consumers across the country,” The company emphasizes. If you caught that thing about decarbonization at the grid edge, that’s one way of letting everyone know that building decarbonization is its own thing. The electricity that comes into the building is another thing entirely. Ideally, it would come from one, or a combination of, the renewable resources that the US is favored with in abundance, with wind and solar coming out on top due to their affordability, accessibility and rapid construction timelines, followed bynew geothermal systemsover the longer term, withhydropowereventually chipping in through existing dam upgrades and new pumped storage projects. The US also has biomass in abundance, but the industry has faced some tough challenges in recent years. All in all, the renewable energy picture still looked bright as of March, when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a near-term forecast through the end of 2027. The agency anticipated thatthe US gridwould add more than 89 gigawatts of utility-scale solar and more than 22 gigawatts of wind by January of 2028. Although the new “American Energy Dominance” policy does support three other forms of utility-scale renewable energy — hydropower, geothermal, and biomass — FERC did not anticipate much activity in those sectors by 2028. Hydropower came in at just 1.3 gigawatts, reflecting the industry’s limited opportunities for expansion as well as its long construction timelines. The similarly constrained geothermal industry registered 89 megawatts. As for generating electricity from biomass, FERC anticipated that the industry will continue to shrink, not grow. With the data center construction boom in full swing, one would think that wind and solar would gain even more support from federal policy makers, particularly solar. After all, last year solar accounted for more than 90% ofnew capacity additions. However, every day is opposite day in the federal energy policy environment of today. The wind industry is now all but banished from federal property, including the all-importantoffshore lease areas. The solar industry has been likewise 86’d from federal lands. Opportunities remain among non-federal jurisdictions and private properties, but local opponents have gained fresh fuel from the White House. Wind and solar developers will have to tread more carefully than ever. On the bright side, the building decarbonization movement provides an opening for the rooftop solar industry to stay afloat until January 20, 2029, when the reins of federal energy policy will pass to another pair of hands — peacefully this time, one hopes. After all, US presidents come and go, but buildings can last for decades or even centuries. The US is already populated with millions of buildings, and millions of rooftops, that will stick around long after the current federal energy policy slides into the dustbin of history. The firmWood Mackenzie is among those crunching the numbers to see green gold in the rooftop solar movement over the long term. Earlier this month they calculated that the market potential market for the residential rooftop solar sector alone could reachapproximately 1,494 gigawattsby 2050. For other signs of a more energy-positive future, keep an eye on heat pumps,bidirectional EV charging, and other technologies at work in the building decarbonization movement. Policies change, but the technology is not going anywhere.

This should not be a surprise to anyone who has been following BYD closely. Its 120,000+ R&D engineers currently submit an average of 45 patent applications and have 20 patents awarded per day. R&D spend is consistently higher than net profits. If you see BYD patent announcements in your news feed, there is clearly a lot going on. Even though many of the company’s patents are for other parts of its diverse business and do not appear on these lists, BYD has built a significant lead in EV intellectual property (IP). At this rate, the gap is poised to widen. Looking at the different lists, far more attention is being paid to BEV IP, with over 9 times as many patents compared to hybrids. While BYD overtaking Toyota’s previous lead in hybrid patents has historical significance, the BEV numbers are far more impactful. BYD clearly wanted you to pay attention to their position at the top, and the organization compiling the list wanted you to pay attention to national origin (we’ll get back to that). However, there are other interesting aspects to the ranking, especially when focusing on just BEVs. Toyota comes in at second with less than half as many BEV patents compared to BYD. However, it is interesting to see Toyota, as well as Honda at fourth, so prominently placed. We have tended to see them as a bit behind in the BEV market. In addition, Toyota has technology partnerships with BYD and FAW at fifth. As such, Toyota has access to significant BEV IP if it decides to put it to use. Beijing New Energy Vehicle Company, a division of BAIC Group, takes third position. While BAIC hasn’t seen as much attention lately, it partners with big names like Huawei, Canadian supplier Magna, Hyundai (#10), and Daimler. And it also makes its own brands, like Arcfox. BAIC was also recently found to have had the highest level of NEV subsidies to automakers in China from 2016 to 2022,over ⅓ of the total, which likely helped to fund its R&D (BYD, for comparison, received less than 1%). Following state-owned FAW, private sector Great Wall comes in at #6, while Geely comes in at #8. While these are two of BYD’s fiercest competitors in the market, they trail significantly in patents. Also, toward the bottom of the top 10 are Ford and GM. While their BEV commitment can sometimes come into question, similar to Toyota, they have clearly invested in developing the technology, and we can hope to see new innovations on the road in the coming years. At this stage, I think it is important to temper the emphasis on patent count a bit. Not all patents are created equal. Some seem to be a significant breakthrough, while others seem to be a relatively minor tweak to existing technology. However, especially when looking at abstracts out of context, what can seem to be relatively minor could be a significant breakthrough, and vice versa. Companies also apply for patents for different reasons. Sometimes it is to protect the technology of a product that they are introducing to the market. For BYD’s U7 technology showcase, for example, I seemed to be seeing many of the technologies in the car appearing as patent announcements while the vehicle was being displayed to the public. However, there are a wide range of patent strategies. Some offensive strategies focus on patenting an idea as early as possible to try to prevent competitors from developing those ideas. Some of those ideas never make it to market, like many of the fascinating inventions in thePopular Sciencemagazines that I read growing up. Sometimes, the intention of the patent is to license technology, rather than to produce it. Sometimes, companies will file for patents to prevent other companies with similar ideas from suing them for patent infringement. However, regardless of the strategy, patent count indicates an effort to develop and secure intellectual property. There are ways to build a viable company without controlling the patents. Companies can license technology, form partnerships, or access the technology through supplier relationships (like the above-mentioned Magna). Newer automakersHuawei and Xiaomi, for example, have focused patents on intelligent driving and connectivity, while also benefitting from EV technology developed with partners.But having IPisan advantage. Turning that advantage into a marketable, reliable, and profitable product is another challenge. As Edison is credited with saying, “Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.” Simply developing the idea enough to obtain a patent does not guarantee success. The organization publishing the lists was clearly emphasizing China’s lead in EV patent count, with BYD as the top company. Beyond sheer patent count, theNew York Timesalso examined China’s expanding lead in high-quality global patents and published research. Going from “copycat” to “innovator.” The effort put into legally securing intellectual property is in stark contrast to the persistent accusations that China is just stealing US IP. And the shift in patents indicates that the old model of Chinese companies relying on technology from JV partners is no longer the case. They should feel proud of that progress, but it is just part of the bigger picture. While it is easy to think about this in terms of competition, the proliferation of new patents also means that a lot of effort is being put into innovation around electric vehicles. That innovation is also an opportunity. Through licensing, partnerships, and supplier relationships, more advanced technology can be accessed. New inventions can also be built upon the innovations of others, even if a licensing agreement is needed for the foundational technology that underlies them. Companies are not just claiming a piece of the technology pie, but also making the pie much bigger. While those who are trying to close themselves off from the world might feel threatened, the potential for global collaboration based on the increasing flow of innovation is a reason to be optimistic.

Rather than responding to ridiculous distortions of our political system with statements about how Republicans are violating norms, degrading our democracy, and going against the will of the people, they have decided to fight fire with fire this time. If you’ve been following US politics in the slightest, you surely know about what’s been going on in Texas with congressional redistricting, but if that’s not your beat, here’s a quick summary to catch up: President Donald Trump reportedly pushed Texas Republicans to increase Republican power and seats in Congress. In response, they basically said,sure thing, we’ll just redraw congressional maps in Texas and add several more Republicans to the US Congress. Aside from blatant problems ofgerrymandering, redrawing these congressional maps normally happens at the beginning of the decade, not in the middle of the decade. Republicans are blatantly breaking more norms of our democracy by deciding they’ll just go ahead and redraw their maps mid-decade in order to gain an advantage in Congress. Republicans are expected to gain 5 seats in the US House of Representatives from this move. California Governor Gavin Newsom decided to step up to the plate and respond to this. Instead of just letting Republicans blatantly take more power via funky map making, simply responding with statements about how this is wrong and why Republicans shouldn’t be cheating and distorting our political structure like this, he said,okay, if you want to play that way, we can play that way too. Newsom decided California would just do the same thing in order to neutralize Republicans’ move. Does this put us down a more dangerous path? Possibly. But you can’t fight fire with paper. For once, Democrats are fighting fire with fire. What other option is there? On Tuesday, at a fundraiser for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, former President Barack Obama backed Newsom up. “I believe that Governor Newsom’s approach is a responsible approach,”Obama said. “I think that approach is a smart, measured approach, designed to address a very particular problem in a very particular moment in time.” Indeed. It’s not normal times, and we can’t respond in normal ways. If the MAGA party is going to use a particular tool in an abnormal way in order to wrest more power for their side, it’s most sensible for Democrats to do the same. What’s the alternative? What’s the legitimate alternative? “We cannot unilaterally allow one of the two major parties to rig the game,” Obama added. “And California is one of the states that has the capacity to offset a large state like Texas.” Obama also pushed Democrats to address gerrymandering in the longer term in order to make our election system more democratic again. However, that’s a hugely difficult problem that he and others have been trying to fix for years. Democrats can’t just say, “we’re going to stop gerrymandering because it’s wrong,” and then allow Republicans to do it, gaining more and more seats in government. “Given that Texas is taking direction from a partisan White House that is effectively saying: gerrymander for partisan purposes so we can maintain the House despite our unpopular policies, redistrict right in the middle of a decade between censuses — which is not how the system was designed; I have tremendous respect for how Governor Newsom has approached this,” Obama also said. We are in extreme times. Trump and Republicans are repealing basic programs, policies, and even legal rulings meant to protect the United States public from pollution, from toxic chemicals, from unsafe corporate practices, and from financial abuse and recklessness. They are doing this much more so than Republicans would have evenconsidereddoing 10, 20, or 30 years ago. It’s brazen destruction of things put in place out of common sense and from scientific evidence, but it suits the financial interests of certain billionaires in the Republican Party, and what else matters? It’s just a consistent, truly absurd attack on the logic and democratic progress that did make the United States great. But people aren’t paying attention, much more interested in social media distractions and obscure gender topics that will likely never have anything to do with their actual lives. So, the cancerous actions continue, and the erosion of our representative republic accelerates. This redistricting controversy is just one element of our ongoing political crisis. It’s a relief that, for once, Democrats are not sitting back and discussing it as if we are living in normal times while letting Republicans mutate and deform our political balance. “This isn’t politics as usual,”said California Democratic Assemblymember Anamarie Avila Fariasthis week. “This is an emergency for our state. This is an emergency for our country. This is an emergency for democracy.” Indeed. It is. FeaturedimagebyWelcome to All ! ツfromPixabay Zach is tryin' to help society help itself one word at a time.

They’re rolling out ahydrogen-ready battery-based hybrid propulsion system—a plug-and-play solution you start out running as a diesel-hybrid and then seamlessly flip to fullhydrogen fuel cellsor battery-electric power when the ports are set up for green hydrogen bunkering.

They’re pitching a super-modular setup: interchangeable fuel cell and battery pods, smart digital control units and a diesel genset as a backup.

IfVINSSENandMarinteknikcan prove they can deliver reliable, cost-effective service on Singapore’s busiest lanes, hydrogen might finally move from lab bench to mainstream shipping fuel. The trick? Ports, policies and purse strings all have to line up. Keep your eyes peeled for next year’s pilot results—they’ll show whether this dream of green hydrogen-powered shipping is set to become the new normal.Spread the love At its heart, the system blends three power sources: diesel gensets, battery banks andhydrogen fuel cells. VINSSEN’s cloud-based vessel management platform keeps an eye on power demands, route data and safety stats in real time. It juggles load between diesel and batteries to optimize cost and emissions, then flips to hydrogen cells for silent, zero-emission cruising when ports are ready to refuel with clean energy. Those AIP-certified 60 kW PEM modules hit peak efficiencies of up to 55% and pass all the marine vibration tests. Batteries handle peak loads, slashing genset time by about 40% in trials. And because everything comes in ISO container-sized skids, swapping modules during port calls is literally a plug-and-play job. Safety’s covered too: double-walled hydrogen tanks, fail-safe valves and next-gen leak detection wired into the digital brain—just what regulators want to see.Playing the Long GameThis partnership isn’t just about hardware—it’s a strategic chess move.VINSSENlocks into Southeast Asia’s booming shipping scene, riding on Marinteknik’s deep ties with shipowners and regulators. Marinteknik, meanwhile, fast-tracks its foray into hydrogen propulsion without investing a fortune in R&D. Their rollout plan is smart: kick off with tugs and ferries, then scale up to offshore support vessels and smaller cargo ships. Each successful pilot builds confidence, nudging leasing companies and insurers to warm up to hydrogen’s risks. And with a regional push onsustainable energy, they’re betting that a 20% cut in fuel costs versus diesel-hybrids will seal early deals and set the bar for competitors.Singapore: From Bunker Fuel to Hydrogen Hub?Singapore handles more cargo than almost anywhere else—over 37 million TEUs a year—and it’s desperate to shake off heavy fuel oil’s nasty emissions. LNG bunkering’s already live, methanol trials are wrapping up, and electric ferries are on the water. Under the Maritime Green Plan 2030, the city-state wants green corridors linking it to Australia and Japan, aiming to slice up to 10 million tonnes of CO₂ in the next decade. The Maritime and Port Authority is dangling grants covering up to 30% of green tech capex, and the Economic Development Board is lining up anchor tenants for hydrogen bunkers. Hosting VINSSEN-Marinteknik pilots cements Singapore as a test-bed: ports fine-tune bunkering protocols, crews get honed on hydrogen-handling, and regulators draft real-world safety rules. Nail a 30% emissions cut with solid uptime, and this local MOU could become the blueprint for Jakarta, Shanghai or even Dubai.The Real-World HurdlesDon’t kid yourself—it’s not going to be smooth sailing. Green hydrogen production in Asia is still in its infancy, with electrolysis capacity clustered in a handful of mega-projects, so supply remains patchy. Building a pan-Asian network of high-pressure hydrogen bunkering stations will demand billions inhydrogen infrastructureinvestments and policy stability that outlasts election cycles. Onboard, those beefy tanks and safety systems eat into cargo space, and crews need rock-solid training; a leak demands split-second action.

It’s the perfect mash-up of raw industrial power, delicate logistics and cutting-edgecryogenic fuelwizardry—and wow, it does not disappoint.Perched on Merritt Island—home to about 36,000 people and nestled inside Florida’s legendary Space Coast wildlife refuge—the Kennedy Space Center has to juggle high-tech performance with environmental care. Every new structure here needs to be a tech marvel without upsetting the local ecosystem. Enter hydrogen, the clean fuel hero.From Truckloads to Tank: The Fill in NumbersThink of the operation as a frozen ballet: heavy-duty trucks rolling in with super-cooled hydrogen, each one a vital dancer in the routine.

It’s a sprawling campaign to build a cislunar gateway, support long-term stays in lunar orbit and on the surface, and set up shop for future Mars trips. Those plans hinge on reliable, repeatable fueling cycles. Having 730,000+ gallons of fuel at the ready lets engineers fine-tune pad procedures, track boil-off rates over weeks, and gather the real-world data essential for off-Earth storage—whether that’s in the Gateway module or future lunar habitats.Why Hydrogen Remains CrucialWhy pick hydrogen over other propellants? It boils down to energy efficiency: hydrogen packs an unbeatable specific impulse—over 460 seconds in vacuum—making it the top choice for deep-space kick.

Lessons in cryogenic handling, rigorous safety protocols and just-in-time delivery are directly shaping green hydrogen projects on Earth. As investors and policymakers watch these high-volume LH₂ operations succeed, confidence builds for deploying hydrogen in heavy industry, grid storage and zero-emission transport—turbocharging the global clean energy shift.And the local impact is real: dozens of specialized roles—from cryogenic engineers to heavy transport drivers—got a boost, cementing the Space Coast’s rep as an aerospace innovation hot spot and hub for high-tech jobs.Scaling Up Lunar Fuel InfrastructurePicture fuel depots not on Merritt Island, but in lunar orbit or parked on the Moon itself.

By plugging in real tank data fromPlug Power, the team pinpointed some quick wins—think tweaking relief-valve set points—that can really move the needle for logistics hubs and future airport fueling stations.Under the guidance ofProfessors Konstantin Matveev, Jake Leachman, and Bin Yang, this work dovetails with DOE-funded clean hydrogen hubs across the Pacific Northwest, helping fuel the region’s push forsustainable energyandindustrial decarbonization. Couple that with strides in lignin-based jet fuel and AI-powered catalysts, and you’ve got the makings of a rock-solidhydrogen infrastructure.By the Numbers25%: Typical boil-off loss in standard storage tanks26%: How much hydrogen you can save just by bumping up relief-valve pressure13%: Transfer-line losses when offloading liquid hydrogenRun hundreds of tank-hours of simulation in mere minutes250 tanks tracked across Plug Power’s global forklift fleet70,000 forklifts powered by liquid hydrogen right nowUnder the HoodAt its heart, WSU’sliquid hydrogen storage mathematical modelis a smart simulation that captures the thermal and fluid dynamics inside cryogenic tanks. It juggles pressure, temperature, insulation specs—you name it—and runs through dozens of “what-if” scenarios, from relief-valve tweaks to pressure-target adjustments, to find that sweet spot where boil-off hits the floor. Thanks to timestamped records from Plug Power’s operational tanks, what would take months of real-world testing now wraps up in minutes on a standard workstation.But they didn’t stop there. Teaming up with thePacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), WSU researchers have also crafted a new lignin-based jet fuel that locks in hydrogen as a stable liquid under normal conditions, releasing it on demand without needing ultra-cold storage. And over at theUniversity of New Haven, a side project onAI-powered catalystsis speeding up how fast hydrogen can bind and unbind, promising bigger efficiency gains and cost cuts down the road.The model even lays out a roadmap to zero boil-off—although you’ll need fancier vacuum-jacketed transfer lines, top-tier insulation, and pinpoint control systems. These findings are already feeding into DOE-sponsored studies on sustainable aviation fuels and FAA evaluations of airport liquid hydrogen facilities, bridging the gap between lab and runway.Market AngleForPlug Power, which runs about 250 liquid hydrogen tanks supporting some 70,000 forklifts globally, chopping boil-off by a full quarter translates straight into fuel savings and fewer refill trips. Withgreen hydrogenavailability rising and fuel cell costs dropping, streamlining logistics is absolutely critical to make the case against battery-only solutions. The Plug Power–WSU collaboration shows how industry and academia can cook up scalable fixes, all thanks to DOE backing.Out here in the Pacific Northwest, state and federal support has ignited projects—from Atlas Agro’s $1 billion zero-carbon fertilizer plant to PNNL’s lignin-jet-fuel ventures—cementing the region as a national leader inhydrogen infrastructure. Logistics players and port authorities eyeing hydrogen for heavy-duty transport know that reliablehydrogen storageand transfer are non-negotiable, and WSU’s model is a handy blueprint.Over at airports, operators can put these insights to work to curb ground-level losses at fueling stations and bolster supply-chain resilience. In harsh industrial environments—think steel mills, glassmakers, refineries—tightening up tank operations is a key step toward on-site hydrogen storage, a linchpin for large-scale decarbonization. And as electrolyzer capacity and renewable power grow, every intact kilogram ofgreen hydrogendelivered is gold for affordablehydrogen production. Regulators might even lean on these results when drafting efficiency standards for cryogenic storage.The race to a zero-emission hydrogen economy hinges on squeezing out every drop of inefficiency, whether it’s boil-off, transfer losses, or reaction bottlenecks. By blending data-driven modeling with cross-sector teamwork, WSU has handed operators a clearer playbook to safeguard precious kilos of hydrogen. As thehydrogen storagescene evolves, these operational tweaks could be exactly what turns potential into performance.Spread the love Under the guidance ofProfessors Konstantin Matveev, Jake Leachman, and Bin Yang, this work dovetails with DOE-funded clean hydrogen hubs across the Pacific Northwest, helping fuel the region’s push forsustainable energyandindustrial decarbonization.

They’re not just talking – the program kicks off with 100 heavy-dutyhydrogen fuel cell trucksand 250 logistics vehicles, hauling raw materials for coking plants and serving urban cold-chain routes.Lüliang’s history is pretty straightforward: coal mining and coke ovens have ruled the roost, churning out a staggering 4.4 billion cubic meters of coke oven gas each year. Lucky for them, that byproduct is a goldmine: operators can tease out around 200,000 tonnes ofhydrogen productionannually—enough juice to keep a whole fleet of zero-emission trucks buzzing.

By pairing SinoHytec’s core fuel cell stacks with Pengfei’s refueling network and digital logistics know-how, they’re basically offering a one-stop shop for fleet operators.Why This Partnership MattersWith China gunning for carbon neutrality by 2060, greening its traditional energy hubs is top of the agenda. This team-up ticks every box: speeding up the commercialization ofhydrogen fuel cells, giving a leg-up to the coal region’s economy, and laying down a blueprint for reproduciblehydrogen infrastructurenetworks across the country. Policymakers are already eyeing it as a go-to model for large-scale rollouts.Opportunities and HurdlesOn the upside, they’re creating a full-circle supply chain—from turning coke oven gas into clean fuel to hitting the road with hydrogen-powered rigs. It’s a big win for opening new markets, slashing tailpipe emissions, and generating local jobs in tech, construction, and operations.But let’s be real: switching tohydrogen fuel cellsisn’t simply buying new trucks and calling it a day. Those zero-emission rigs still come with steeper price tags compared to diesel.

It sounds like sci-fi, right? Well, that moment is inching closer. On August 21, 2025,Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc.—the trailblazer inhigh-temperature proton exchange membrane (HT-PEM)innovation—teamed up with a leading U.S.-based global semiconductor and wireless technology player. Their goal? Co-develop and test next-genelectrochemical gas sensorsbuilt around Advent’s exclusiveIon Pair membrane.Why This Partnership mattersThis collaboration isn’t just about beefing upfuel cell technologyfor big power stations. Instead, it’s about shrinking that tech down into pocket-sized sensors for air quality checks, food-safety scans, and even non-invasive medical diagnostics—imagine bedside screening for biomarkers or breath-based early cancer detection. And we’re not talking bulky lab gear. These sensors could slot right intoportable electronicslike smartphones, wearables, or smart-home gadgets.Getting to Know the Ion Pair MembraneAt the heart of this project is Advent’s HT-PEMIon Pair membrane, originally cooked up atLos Alamos National Laboratory. Here’s what makes it tick:High-Temperature Stability:Keeps its cool (or heat) at elevated temperatures, boosting sensitivity and warding off contamination.Mechanical Robustness:Handles the stresses of microfabrication like a champ, paving the way for wafer-scale integration.Proton Conductivity:Powers precise electrochemical reactions, turning gas concentrations into clear electrical signals.In practice, trace gases—whether from air, breath, or food aromas—interact with tiny catalyst sites in the membrane. Protons zip through the structure, generating a current that directly corresponds to gas levels. It’s essentially the same principle behindhydrogen fuel cells, just miniaturized to detect parts-per-billion of target molecules.The Market Is Ripe for Tiny PowerhousesWe’re living in an era where remote monitoring, telemedicine, and the Internet of Things are converging. Demand for compact, low-power sensors is skyrocketing across industries. In an industrial setting, they’ll be vital for leak detection inhydrogen infrastructure—critical as pipelines and refueling stations lean on real-time safety monitoring. Meanwhile, restaurants, breweries, and food distributors need on-site gas analysis to keep products fresh. And consumers? They’re craving smarter air-quality tracking, whether they’re at home or on the move.How This Stacks Up Against Other SensorsSure, metal oxide semiconductor and MEMS-based sensors have made strides, but they often demand high operating temperatures or struggle with specificity. Advent’s Ion Pair HT-PEM approach offers a sweet spot: pinpoint selectivity at moderate power levels, plus a direct electronic readout that jives perfectly with digital electronics.Impact on Society and the EnvironmentEmbedding accurate gas sensors into everyday devices democratizes environmental monitoring. Imagine crowdsourced air-quality maps updated in real time by the phones in people’s pockets—no more wondering if that smog alert really applies to your street. Restaurants could scan spoilage gases at the pallet before it even reaches the shelves, slashing waste. Hospitals could breeze through breath-marker screenings for early disease detection, easing the load on lab facilities and cutting costs.Business and Strategy MovesWhat’s in it for the two partners? For Advent, it’s about broadening its patent fortress—around 150 issued or pending patents—and tapping into global semiconductor know-how. For the unnamed tech giant, it’s a chance to weave advancedsensor miniaturizationinto its chip roadmap, fast-tracking its entry into healthtech and environmental-monitoring markets.Both parties stand to gain from:Market Expansion:From city-wide air-monitoring networks to food-processing plants hungry for precise gas profiling.Healthtech Innovation:Telemedicine and point-of-care diagnostics are crying out for non-invasive, cost-effective screening tools.Consumer Electronics:Smartwatches, earbuds, and phones could boast a brand-new feature—molecular sensing on the go.Plus, this partnership could open licensing doors, as other device makers prefer adopting proven membrane materials rather than building them from scratch.Sizing Up the CompetitionBig names likeBoschandSonyhave rolled out MEMS-based gas sensors, but they often juggle power consumption and specificity. Advent’s Ion Pair platform could hit a unique sweet spot with robust performance at moderate temperatures, stellar selectivity, and seamless integration with the partner’s advanced wireless modules. Nail the cost curve, and these tiny sensors could shake up a market long dominated by bulky, less flexible modules.Livermore: Where Science Meets Startup VibeAdvent’s HQ inLivermore, California, sits smack in the innovation corridor that gave us Lawrence Livermore National Lab. With about 87,000 residents and a per-capita rent of $2,324, Livermore has transformed from a science outpost into a buzzing hub where material science collides with microelectronics and startup energy.Overcoming the Hurdles AheadMiniaturizing cutting-edge tech is never a cakewalk. The teams will need to:Prove long-term durability under repeated cyclingStamp out cross-sensitivity between different gasesMerge the membranes with existing chip-fabrication workflowsPerfect device packaging and power management to hit consumer-price targets in the cutthroat smartphone marketLooking Out to the HorizonIn the coming months, lab tests will put the Ion Pair sensors through their paces—checking sensitivity, selectivity, and endurance. If all goes well, prototype devices could pop up by late 2026, with small-batch production kicking off in 2027 and a full-blown commercial rollout by 2028. Beyond smartphones, these membranes might find homes in industrial automation systems, drone-based environmental mapping services, or futuristic fitness wearables that track metabolic biomarkers during workouts.It’s a clear sign that decades of R&D inhydrogen fuel cellsaren’t just confined to vehicles. Membranes, catalysts, and stack designs fine-tuned for heavy-duty transport are now getting a second wind in sensor tech. That kind of cross-pollination is exactly what sparks major leaps in innovation.Ultimately, this pact underscores a broader shift: as we build outsustainable energysystems and push forindustrial decarbonization, supporting technologies like gas sensors become indispensable. They ensure safety inhydrogen infrastructure, boost public health through better air-quality monitoring, and open doors to new consumer experiences that weave zero-emission tech into everyday life.The Catalystwill be keeping a close eye on how these micro-sensors evolve—from Livermore lab benches to the devices in your pocket—and what breakthroughs lie around the corner.About Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc.Headquartered in the U.S. with major operations in Greece, Advent sits at the cutting edge ofHT-PEM fuel cell technology, backed by about 150 patents. Born out of Los Alamos National Laboratory, the company trades on NASDAQ under the ticker ADN.Spread the love Why This Partnership mattersThis collaboration isn’t just about beefing upfuel cell technologyfor big power stations. Instead, it’s about shrinking that tech down into pocket-sized sensors for air quality checks, food-safety scans, and even non-invasive medical diagnostics—imagine bedside screening for biomarkers or breath-based early cancer detection. And we’re not talking bulky lab gear. These sensors could slot right intoportable electronicslike smartphones, wearables, or smart-home gadgets.Getting to Know the Ion Pair MembraneAt the heart of this project is Advent’s HT-PEMIon Pair membrane, originally cooked up atLos Alamos National Laboratory. Here’s what makes it tick:High-Temperature Stability:Keeps its cool (or heat) at elevated temperatures, boosting sensitivity and warding off contamination.Mechanical Robustness:Handles the stresses of microfabrication like a champ, paving the way for wafer-scale integration.Proton Conductivity:Powers precise electrochemical reactions, turning gas concentrations into clear electrical signals.In practice, trace gases—whether from air, breath, or food aromas—interact with tiny catalyst sites in the membrane. Protons zip through the structure, generating a current that directly corresponds to gas levels. It’s essentially the same principle behindhydrogen fuel cells, just miniaturized to detect parts-per-billion of target molecules.The Market Is Ripe for Tiny PowerhousesWe’re living in an era where remote monitoring, telemedicine, and the Internet of Things are converging. Demand for compact, low-power sensors is skyrocketing across industries. In an industrial setting, they’ll be vital for leak detection inhydrogen infrastructure—critical as pipelines and refueling stations lean on real-time safety monitoring. Meanwhile, restaurants, breweries, and food distributors need on-site gas analysis to keep products fresh. And consumers? They’re craving smarter air-quality tracking, whether they’re at home or on the move.How This Stacks Up Against Other SensorsSure, metal oxide semiconductor and MEMS-based sensors have made strides, but they often demand high operating temperatures or struggle with specificity. Advent’s Ion Pair HT-PEM approach offers a sweet spot: pinpoint selectivity at moderate power levels, plus a direct electronic readout that jives perfectly with digital electronics.Impact on Society and the EnvironmentEmbedding accurate gas sensors into everyday devices democratizes environmental monitoring. Imagine crowdsourced air-quality maps updated in real time by the phones in people’s pockets—no more wondering if that smog alert really applies to your street.

They ensure safety inhydrogen infrastructure, boost public health through better air-quality monitoring, and open doors to new consumer experiences that weave zero-emission tech into everyday life.The Catalystwill be keeping a close eye on how these micro-sensors evolve—from Livermore lab benches to the devices in your pocket—and what breakthroughs lie around the corner.About Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc.Headquartered in the U.S. with major operations in Greece, Advent sits at the cutting edge ofHT-PEM fuel cell technology, backed by about 150 patents. Born out of Los Alamos National Laboratory, the company trades on NASDAQ under the ticker ADN.Spread the love We’re living in an era where remote monitoring, telemedicine, and the Internet of Things are converging. Demand for compact, low-power sensors is skyrocketing across industries. In an industrial setting, they’ll be vital for leak detection inhydrogen infrastructure—critical as pipelines and refueling stations lean on real-time safety monitoring. Meanwhile, restaurants, breweries, and food distributors need on-site gas analysis to keep products fresh. And consumers? They’re craving smarter air-quality tracking, whether they’re at home or on the move.How This Stacks Up Against Other SensorsSure, metal oxide semiconductor and MEMS-based sensors have made strides, but they often demand high operating temperatures or struggle with specificity. Advent’s Ion Pair HT-PEM approach offers a sweet spot: pinpoint selectivity at moderate power levels, plus a direct electronic readout that jives perfectly with digital electronics.Impact on Society and the EnvironmentEmbedding accurate gas sensors into everyday devices democratizes environmental monitoring. Imagine crowdsourced air-quality maps updated in real time by the phones in people’s pockets—no more wondering if that smog alert really applies to your street. Restaurants could scan spoilage gases at the pallet before it even reaches the shelves, slashing waste. Hospitals could breeze through breath-marker screenings for early disease detection, easing the load on lab facilities and cutting costs.Business and Strategy MovesWhat’s in it for the two partners? For Advent, it’s about broadening its patent fortress—around 150 issued or pending patents—and tapping into global semiconductor know-how. For the unnamed tech giant, it’s a chance to weave advancedsensor miniaturizationinto its chip roadmap, fast-tracking its entry into healthtech and environmental-monitoring markets.Both parties stand to gain from:Market Expansion:From city-wide air-monitoring networks to food-processing plants hungry for precise gas profiling.Healthtech Innovation:Telemedicine and point-of-care diagnostics are crying out for non-invasive, cost-effective screening tools.Consumer Electronics:Smartwatches, earbuds, and phones could boast a brand-new feature—molecular sensing on the go.Plus, this partnership could open licensing doors, as other device makers prefer adopting proven membrane materials rather than building them from scratch.Sizing Up the CompetitionBig names likeBoschandSonyhave rolled out MEMS-based gas sensors, but they often juggle power consumption and specificity. Advent’s Ion Pair platform could hit a unique sweet spot with robust performance at moderate temperatures, stellar selectivity, and seamless integration with the partner’s advanced wireless modules. Nail the cost curve, and these tiny sensors could shake up a market long dominated by bulky, less flexible modules.Livermore: Where Science Meets Startup VibeAdvent’s HQ inLivermore, California, sits smack in the innovation corridor that gave us Lawrence Livermore National Lab. With about 87,000 residents and a per-capita rent of $2,324, Livermore has transformed from a science outpost into a buzzing hub where material science collides with microelectronics and startup energy.Overcoming the Hurdles AheadMiniaturizing cutting-edge tech is never a cakewalk. The teams will need to:Prove long-term durability under repeated cyclingStamp out cross-sensitivity between different gasesMerge the membranes with existing chip-fabrication workflowsPerfect device packaging and power management to hit consumer-price targets in the cutthroat smartphone marketLooking Out to the HorizonIn the coming months, lab tests will put the Ion Pair sensors through their paces—checking sensitivity, selectivity, and endurance. If all goes well, prototype devices could pop up by late 2026, with small-batch production kicking off in 2027 and a full-blown commercial rollout by 2028. Beyond smartphones, these membranes might find homes in industrial automation systems, drone-based environmental mapping services, or futuristic fitness wearables that track metabolic biomarkers during workouts.It’s a clear sign that decades of R&D inhydrogen fuel cellsaren’t just confined to vehicles.

Sounds like a stretch? Well, over$5 billionis already on the table, so it’s more reality than sci-fi. Thanks to the EU’sRED IIIpush and next year’sDelegated Acts, the race forindustrial decarbonizationis in full swing. So, how are these energy giants pivoting, why themaritime sectoris a game-changer, and what speed bumps are lurking ahead? Let’s break it down.Context: EU’s Regulatory PushTheEuropean Unionjust turned up the heat on climate goals, demanding industries slash emissions big time. UnderRED III, refiners have to swap out fossil hydrogen for renewable or low-carbon blends. On top of that, the 2025Delegated Actslay down the law on lifecycle greenhouse-gas cuts—so any hydrogen made via electrolysis or SMR with CCUS better meet those strict targets. Problem is, some member states are dragging their feet on national rulebooks, putting projects in limbo.The Refinery ShiftFor decades, oil hubs leaned on gray hydrogen straight from fossil fuels. Now, they’re plowing money intohydrogen productionthrough water electrolysis powered by sun and wind, or steam methane reforming paired with carbon capture, utilization, and storage. The payoff? Emissions could tumble by over 70%. Industry insiders say parts of the sector can green up fast and without breaking the bank. With capital commitments north of$5 billionand auction bids forgreen hydrogendropping—about 18% across the EU and a whopping 55% dive in German tenders—costs are finally heading south.Maritime OpportunityWe all know you can’t just slap a plug into a cargo ship—electrification at sea has limits. That’s why themaritime sectoris setting its sights on hydrogen derivatives like ammonia and methanol. Under theFuelEU Maritimerules and the IMO’s Net Zero Framework, shipping lines need greener fuel options. Picture bunkering ammonia made fromgreen hydrogenalongside regular marine diesel—it’s a solid bridge to zero-emission voyages on those long-haul routes.Challenges and OutlookIt isn’t all smooth sailing, though. Policy whiplash and price premiums for clean hydrogen still bite, and until every country nuts-and-bolts theRED IIIrules, progress will stay patchy. On the bright side, theEU Hydrogen Bankis doling out support, and plans for guarantee of origin standards should crank up market clarity forhydrogen infrastructure.Come 2030, refiners will be eyeing roughly0.5 million tonnesofgreen hydrogeneach year just to stay compliant, which shows the scale of this shift. While renewable fuels of non-biological origin in transport are pegged at a modest1%, knock-on effects in aviation, chemicals, and beyond could be huge as supply stabilizes and costs fall.At the end of the day, Europe’s refinery heavyweights stand at a crossroads. If costs keep sliding and regulations lock in, these plants could morph into hubs forsustainable energy—fueling industry, shipping, and possibly more. It’s a bold bet onindustrial decarbonizationand the future ofsustainable energy, one that could redraw the continent’s energy map for decades to come.Spread the love TheEuropean Unionjust turned up the heat on climate goals, demanding industries slash emissions big time.

That’s exactly whatPort of South Louisianahas in the works: a cutting-edgehydrogen fueling bargeready to pumpe-methanoland other green fuels straight into ships, totally changing the game for marine refueling.Project Overview and ScopeThe port has put out a call for bids on a custom-built vessel designed to carryGrade C flammable liquids. At its heart ise-methanol—a synthetic marine fuel crafted by combininggreen hydrogenfrom renewable electrolysis with captured CO₂. In plain terms, this barge turns the river into a refueling superhighway. It’s powered by a Build Back Better Regional Challenge grant from theU.S. Economic Development Administration, matched by funding and technical support fromLouisiana Economic Development. As part of theH2theFutureinitiative, the barge complements an array of projects—electrolyzers, hydrogen pipelines, workforce training programs—all aimed at acceleratingindustrial decarbonizationin South Louisiana.Comprehensive engineering and fabrication plans covering steel sourcing, internal coatings, and system integration.Performance guarantees for transfer rates and leak-prevention systems.Optional add-ons: long-term maintenance, crew training, and remote monitoring services.Proven safety expertise with hydrogen-based fuels and marine fueling systems.Technical Design HighlightsThis non-self-propelled, double-hulled steel barge packs:Five pairs of insulated cargo tanks with corrosion-resistant linings, perfect for storinge-methanol.A pump house capable of 6,000 barrels per hour loading and 1,000 gallons per minute offloading.Advanced safety gear: automatic leak detectors, remote shutoff valves, foam suppression, and secondary containment.Interchangeable hose connections compatible with existing shore-side bunker equipment.Future-ready pipework prepped for pure hydrogen transfer, making upgrades seamless as markets evolve.Designed to meet or exceedU.S. Coast GuardandEPAregulations, the barge features a SCADA system for real-time operations oversight—fueling everything from tugboats to small ferries.Strategic and Business BenefitsWhy float your fueling station? First off, vessels save hours by skipping back-and-forth trips, cutting congestion at busy docks and slashing operating costs. For the port, it unlocks new revenue streams—fuel sales margins, handling fees, service contracts, you name it. Withhydrogen infrastructureinvestment on the rise, South Louisiana scores a first-mover advantage. Early entry into thegreen hydrogenbunkering market positions the port as a hub forzero-emissiontech, attracting operators eager to meet stricter emissions standards. Plus, it boosts the port’s ESG profile, potentially lowering the cost of capital as financiers reward real decarbonization efforts.Advancing Industrial DecarbonizationThe Mississippi corridor already handles massive volumes of industrial hydrogen used in refining and chemical processes. Switching marine bunkering from diesel toe-methanolcan cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 100%, provided renewable feedstocks are used. That shift not only helps Louisiana hit its net-zero-by-2050 targets but also reduces nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions that affect nearby communities. Every barge call usinge-methanolinstead of diesel prevents tons of local pollutants while supporting corporate sustainability goals.Regional Legacy and ContextSouth Louisiana’s energy story stretches back over a century, evolving from crude oil exports to a sprawling petrochemical powerhouse. ThePort of South Louisianaranks among the Western Hemisphere’s largest tonnage ports, moving grains, bulk commodities, and hydrocarbons. Beneath the surface, a dense network of hydrogen pipelines, storage terminals, and electrolyzers already feeds refineries and chemical plants. In 2022, this corridor was one of six U.S. regions tapped by the Build Back Better Regional Challenge for clean hydrogen cluster funding. The floating fueling barge is the latest chapter in a region rewriting its energy narrative for thesustainable energyera.Funding, Partnerships, and GovernanceThe project’s total budget is $74.5 million, pooled from:U.S. Economic Development Administration: Core grant funding under the Build Back Better Challenge.Louisiana Economic Development: State matching funds, permitting support, and workforce development programs.H2theFuture: A 25-member coalition guiding project alignment, technical reviews, and training pipelines.This alliance of federal, state, and private stakeholders shows how targeted policy incentives can unlock advanced clean-energy infrastructure.Timeline and Critical MilestonesBid submission deadline:August 28, 2025Contract award:by September 24, 2025Engineering & procurement:Q4 2025 – Q2 2026Fabrication & system integration:Q3 2026 – Q4 2026Sea trials & commissioning:Q1 2027Operational launch:March 31, 2027When it hits the water, this barge will be the first of its kind in the United States, cementing South Louisiana’s leadership inhydrogen productionand distribution.Risks, Challenges, and What to WatchAmbitious projects come with their share of hurdles:Supply chain pressureson specialized hoses, valves, and steel alloys could stretch fabrication schedules.Regulatory evolution: As state and federal agencies fine-tune hydrogen bunkering guidelines, designs may need adjustments.Feedstock economics: The price edge ofe-methanolhinges on renewable power costs and CO₂ sourcing.Workforce readiness: Fabricators, welders, and operators require training on new materials and safety procedures.Stakeholders should keep an eye on vendor proposals, permit updates, and market shifts in renewable power and CO₂ pricing.Looking Ahead and Broader ImplicationsThe Port of South Louisiana’s floating fueling station could serve as a lighthouse for maritime decarbonization. If this model proves workable, expect other inland and coastal ports to explore similarhydrogen infrastructureprojects. Down the road, we might see retrofitted barges dispensing green ammonia or even pumping pure hydrogen into fuel cell–powered vessels.

As part of theH2theFutureinitiative, the barge complements an array of projects—electrolyzers, hydrogen pipelines, workforce training programs—all aimed at acceleratingindustrial decarbonizationin South Louisiana.Comprehensive engineering and fabrication plans covering steel sourcing, internal coatings, and system integration.Performance guarantees for transfer rates and leak-prevention systems.Optional add-ons: long-term maintenance, crew training, and remote monitoring services.Proven safety expertise with hydrogen-based fuels and marine fueling systems.Technical Design HighlightsThis non-self-propelled, double-hulled steel barge packs:Five pairs of insulated cargo tanks with corrosion-resistant linings, perfect for storinge-methanol.A pump house capable of 6,000 barrels per hour loading and 1,000 gallons per minute offloading.Advanced safety gear: automatic leak detectors, remote shutoff valves, foam suppression, and secondary containment.Interchangeable hose connections compatible with existing shore-side bunker equipment.Future-ready pipework prepped for pure hydrogen transfer, making upgrades seamless as markets evolve.Designed to meet or exceedU.S. Coast GuardandEPAregulations, the barge features a SCADA system for real-time operations oversight—fueling everything from tugboats to small ferries.Strategic and Business BenefitsWhy float your fueling station? First off, vessels save hours by skipping back-and-forth trips, cutting congestion at busy docks and slashing operating costs. For the port, it unlocks new revenue streams—fuel sales margins, handling fees, service contracts, you name it. Withhydrogen infrastructureinvestment on the rise, South Louisiana scores a first-mover advantage. Early entry into thegreen hydrogenbunkering market positions the port as a hub forzero-emissiontech, attracting operators eager to meet stricter emissions standards. Plus, it boosts the port’s ESG profile, potentially lowering the cost of capital as financiers reward real decarbonization efforts.Advancing Industrial DecarbonizationThe Mississippi corridor already handles massive volumes of industrial hydrogen used in refining and chemical processes. Switching marine bunkering from diesel toe-methanolcan cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 100%, provided renewable feedstocks are used. That shift not only helps Louisiana hit its net-zero-by-2050 targets but also reduces nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions that affect nearby communities.

ThePort of South Louisianaranks among the Western Hemisphere’s largest tonnage ports, moving grains, bulk commodities, and hydrocarbons. Beneath the surface, a dense network of hydrogen pipelines, storage terminals, and electrolyzers already feeds refineries and chemical plants.

It’s a milestone forhydrogen fuel cells, proving they’re more than a lab novelty—they’re ready for Brazil’s demanding roads. The plant is a key link in GWM’s global network bridging China and Latin America, a real frontline in the drive forindustrial decarbonizationunder Brazil’s blazing sun and humid skies.After sealing a 2023 MoU with the São Paulo State Government to explore hydrogen applications,GWMdidn’t waste a moment: by 2024, five refueling stations had popped up across the state. On day one in Iracemápolis, the factory rolled out a rig packing a 105 kWh battery and a 40 kg hydrogen tank. Starting this September, these trucks will hit the highways of São Paulo and Minas Gerais for road tests in partnership with theUniversity of São PauloandUNIFEI. The mission? Prove that thiszero-emission technologycan haul heavy loads, top up in minutes, and run on bothgreen hydrogenand ethanol-sourced hydrogen. Over 1,000 km of real-world trials will reveal the true range under full load.Here’s the scoop: on August 16, the Iracemápolis plant flung open its doors, unveiling Brazil’s first operational fuel cell electric truck. The state governments of São Paulo and Minas Gerais are backing the project, following a November 2024 agreement withUNIFEIto build outgreen hydrogensupply andhydrogen infrastructure. So far, five hydrogen stations are up and running, aligning with Brazil’s MOVER program to clean up freight transport. FTXT even ran initial trials with prototype units in 2024.The upcoming tests will tackle loading cycles, range demos across tropical lowlands and plateau regions, and refueling drills. Data fromUSPandUNIFEI—think vehicle telemetry, fuel economy, and system durability—will feed back into product tweaks and an export playbook for Chinese hydrogen solutions eyeing global markets hungry for sustainable energy options.Dive into the tech, and you’ll see FTXT’s customhydrogen fuel celltechnology at the core. It pairs a 105 kWh lithium-ion battery with a high-pressure fuel cell stack fueled by 40 kg of compressed hydrogen, emitting nothing but water vapor. They’re touting a 60% peak efficiency, though real-world numbers might flex a bit. Hydrogen tanks store the gas at 350 bar, and early dry runs have already logged cold-start performance and thermal management under Brazil’s summertime heatwaves.Fuel comes from two sources: renewable-powered electrolysis and ethanol reforming—leveraging Brazil’s biofuel infrastructure to diversifyhydrogen production. Mixing these methods in the pilot will highlight cost and performance trade-offs, guiding decisions on scaling, logistics, and local feedstock availability.This launch is China’s clean-energy exporters making a calculated play.GWMand its unit,FTXT Energy Tech, are cementing their footprint in Latin America, while Brazil secures tech transfer and workforce upskilling. The 2023 MoU with São Paulo set the stage; the 2024 pact with Minas Gerais strengthened a network spanning R&D, refueling, and policy alignment.Officials tout this as a blueprint for regional adoption ofhydrogen infrastructure. For GWM, it’s about credibility and market share in the globalhydrogen fuel cellsrace. For Brazil, it underscores its strategic pivot away from diesel and a commitment to carbon-neutral targets without compromising heavy freight capabilities—riding the wave of China’s Belt and Road green-energy projects.Brazil’s biofuel journey began in the 1970s, but heavy-duty trucks have lagged behind. Electric trucks have hit range and charging constraints that hydrogen can sidestep with rapid refuels and longer hauls. Still, the hydrogen roadmap has steep hurdles: high electrolyzer costs, swinging ethanol feedstock prices, and capital-intensivehydrogen infrastructurerollouts. Regulators also face the task of crafting safety codes for handling high-pressure hydrogen—a non-trivial undertaking.Even with five stations in São Paulo, nationwide coverage is years away. Market forces—fuel price volatility, maintenance demands, competition from battery trucks—will test whether hydrogen shifts from pilot stage to mainstream solution. Logistics in remote areas could also trip up supply consistency.This program isn’t just about semis; it’s about building talent and ecosystems. Researchers atUSPandUNIFEIwill get hands-on experience, and local technicians will learn to service fuel cell stacks and refueling hubs. We’re talking dozens of high-skill jobs in engineering, maintenance, and logistics—laying a foundation forindustrial decarbonizationin the region.Beyond new employment, this initiative sparks knowledge transfer that could turbocharge Brazil’s own R&D ingreen hydrogen, setting the stage for cross-sector rollouts in shipping, industry, and power generation—essential for genuineindustrial decarbonization. Word is local spare-part supply chains are already forming around Iracemápolis.Seeing a hydrogen-fueled 18-wheeler roar to life in Brazil is downright thrilling. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves—hype can outpace economics. Unless green hydrogen costs plummet and supply chains prove bulletproof, this may stay a flashy pilot rather than a freight revolution. I’ll be watching the price-per-kilometer and downtime stats before popping any celebratory corks. And remember: a few breakdowns could dash political goodwill faster than you think.Trials kick off in September 2025, and monthly updates fromUSPandUNIFEIwill drop performance metrics. If the data checks out, GWM will press for broader rollouts across Latin America. If not, this project might become a textbook case on the limits of early-stage hydrogen tech.

Stakeholders will also be eyeing public acceptance and regulatory tweaks needed for widerhydrogen infrastructuredeployment.Spread the love Dive into the tech, and you’ll see FTXT’s customhydrogen fuel celltechnology at the core. It pairs a 105 kWh lithium-ion battery with a high-pressure fuel cell stack fueled by 40 kg of compressed hydrogen, emitting nothing but water vapor. They’re touting a 60% peak efficiency, though real-world numbers might flex a bit. Hydrogen tanks store the gas at 350 bar, and early dry runs have already logged cold-start performance and thermal management under Brazil’s summertime heatwaves.Fuel comes from two sources: renewable-powered electrolysis and ethanol reforming—leveraging Brazil’s biofuel infrastructure to diversifyhydrogen production. Mixing these methods in the pilot will highlight cost and performance trade-offs, guiding decisions on scaling, logistics, and local feedstock availability.This launch is China’s clean-energy exporters making a calculated play.GWMand its unit,FTXT Energy Tech, are cementing their footprint in Latin America, while Brazil secures tech transfer and workforce upskilling. The 2023 MoU with São Paulo set the stage; the 2024 pact with Minas Gerais strengthened a network spanning R&D, refueling, and policy alignment.Officials tout this as a blueprint for regional adoption ofhydrogen infrastructure. For GWM, it’s about credibility and market share in the globalhydrogen fuel cellsrace. For Brazil, it underscores its strategic pivot away from diesel and a commitment to carbon-neutral targets without compromising heavy freight capabilities—riding the wave of China’s Belt and Road green-energy projects.Brazil’s biofuel journey began in the 1970s, but heavy-duty trucks have lagged behind. Electric trucks have hit range and charging constraints that hydrogen can sidestep with rapid refuels and longer hauls. Still, the hydrogen roadmap has steep hurdles: high electrolyzer costs, swinging ethanol feedstock prices, and capital-intensivehydrogen infrastructurerollouts. Regulators also face the task of crafting safety codes for handling high-pressure hydrogen—a non-trivial undertaking.Even with five stations in São Paulo, nationwide coverage is years away. Market forces—fuel price volatility, maintenance demands, competition from battery trucks—will test whether hydrogen shifts from pilot stage to mainstream solution. Logistics in remote areas could also trip up supply consistency.This program isn’t just about semis; it’s about building talent and ecosystems. Researchers atUSPandUNIFEIwill get hands-on experience, and local technicians will learn to service fuel cell stacks and refueling hubs. We’re talking dozens of high-skill jobs in engineering, maintenance, and logistics—laying a foundation forindustrial decarbonizationin the region.Beyond new employment, this initiative sparks knowledge transfer that could turbocharge Brazil’s own R&D ingreen hydrogen, setting the stage for cross-sector rollouts in shipping, industry, and power generation—essential for genuineindustrial decarbonization. Word is local spare-part supply chains are already forming around Iracemápolis.Seeing a hydrogen-fueled 18-wheeler roar to life in Brazil is downright thrilling. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves—hype can outpace economics. Unless green hydrogen costs plummet and supply chains prove bulletproof, this may stay a flashy pilot rather than a freight revolution.

Well, meet the match you didn’t see coming.H2 Power ’n’ Heat GmbHhas dropped its modularH2 Power Boxunits right next to the waste site run byH2 Core Systems GmbHin Germany’s Gifhorn district. Nestled in Ausbüttel’s rolling meadows, thisRenewable energy pilotis quietly cranking out zero-emission power and heat exactly where it’s needed. Buckle up—off-grid power just got a major upgrade.Since 2016, Berlin-basedH2 Power ’n’ Heathas been tinkering with mobile and stationary systems that turnGreen hydrogeninto clean electricity and warmth. Meanwhile,H2 Core Systems GmbH, headquartered near Heide, has been perfecting full-cycle hydrogen solutions—fromelectrolyzersto fuel cells—for factories, infrastructure, and everything in between. After countless lab tests, field trials, and those “eureka” moments, these two agile SMEs teamed up to show the world howDecentralized energycan roll out at startup speed, not on a decade-long government schedule.This pilot sits next to a waste site cradled by woodlands and farmland—proof that you don’t need giga-projects or fancy pipelines to makeHydrogen fuel cellswork. Just drop a few modules, hook up the plumbing, and watch them hum away, cutting noise, smells, and carbon footprints all at once.And here’s the kicker: you don’t have to slog through years of planning. These micro-pilots spin up in weeks, not years. That’s the magic ofDecentralized energy: instant deployment, instant impact.Local councils and environmental agencies jumped on board early, seeing gold in regional decarbonization and circular economy innovation. Whether you run a farm, a festival, or a B&B, you can plug in this setup without calling in a battalion of engineers—just good old off-grid power you can brag about over coffee and have live by lunchtime.What This MeansPure zero-emission output: Wave goodbye to soot, smog, and local pollutants.Grid-friendly microgrid: Replaces diesel generators, eases peak-load stress, and keeps lights on when the main grid stumbles.Circular economy win: Turns landfill byproducts into a clean energy loop—waste meetsGreen hydrogen.Budget-stable fueling: Hydrogen refills tame the wild swings of diesel prices.Modular scaling: Snap in as manyH2 Power Boxunits as you need—no oversized generators draining cash.Smoother logistics: Shipping hydrogen beats hauling oil for safety and simplicity.Municipalities, rural communities, and industrial parks can finally lock in predictable energy costs without sweating surprise bills or emissions fines.

Thanks to the modular design, from delivery to go-live took mere weeks. Operators keep tabs via a slick mobile dashboard, getting instant alerts if hydrogen pressure dips or upkeep is due. When locals popped by for open days, they left with jaws on the floor—a landfill never felt so futuristic.Strategic AngleZoom out, and you’ll see this project is a perfect fit for Germany’sEnergiewendeand the EU’s bigger push forGreen hydrogen. While the giants chase mega-hubs, nimble SMEs likeH2 Power ’n’ Heat GmbHandH2 Core Systems GmbHare swooping in to fill the gaps, proving real impact can happen on a regional timetable, not three parliaments down the road.Public funds and incentives have poured billions into hydrogen R&D, and this pilot shows how fast that cash can spark circular economy gold. Partnering with Fraunhofer and other research outfits meant rigorous testing and quicker certifications. Plus, all that data streaming out of Ausbüttel is a regulator’s dream—fueling smarter safety rules, permitting processes, and grid-connection guidelines.Don’t overlook the ripple effects through local supply chains either: tank fabricators, service workshops, and engineering firms are all scoring new business, creating fresh green-tech jobs.

This UK start-up, spun out ofImperial College Londonin 2024, just closed a £1.2 million seed round and scored a £25,000 grant from theHenry Royce Institute. Their secret sauce? A novelmetallic nanofiber mesh electrodethat promises to superchargeelectrolyser performance—and could sliceproduction costsby 20–30%.Born from seven years of tinkering at Imperial’sEnergy Futures Lab, the founding crew—four PhD chemists and two electrochemical engineers—has already locked down two patent families coveringmetal electrospinning recipesandbinderless mesh architectures. In short, they’ve built a fortress around their IP as they gear up to scale. And with industry veterans on their advisory board for electrolyser manufacturing and scale-up, they’re hardly flying blind.Strategic UpsideEarly institutional backing isn’t just a gold star; it’s a green light for more investors and strategic partnerships. Even better, M-Spin’s retrofit-friendly design lets operators drop these mats into existing electrolyser stacks—no rip-and-replace required. That kind of simplicity sings to:Electrolyser OEMshunting for a quick product boost without reinventing the wheel.Project developerschasing lower capex and faster commissioning.Energy retailerskeen to lock in bulkgreen hydrogensupplies and tighten margins.Europe’s push for 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen by 2030 means massive upside for low-cost electrolysers. M-Spin’s already in talks with anchor customers in the UK and Germany, where procurement pipelines are heating up. Their mesh could fast-track profitability for gigawatt-scale facilities by trimming upfront spend and boosting runtime efficiency.Technical SnapshotAt the core is a fresh spin onelectrospinning. Instead of polymer or carbon fibers, M-Spin’s R&D team—shout-out to Professor Nigel Brandon’s lab—has dialed in metal-based recipes. Here’s the nutshell version:Fiber diameter:500 nm to 1 µm, balancing toughness with high surface exposure.Porosity:Up to 90%, which smoothed out mass transport of reactants and gas release.Surface area:As much as 1,000× that of metallic foams, multiplying active sites for water splitting—the core ofhydrogen production.Material versatility:Nickel, iron, copper and ceramics—each tuned to specific electrolyser chemistries.In lab-scale trials (50 cm² electrodes), they’ve hit current densities north of industry benchmarks, running stably at 1 A/cm² for more than 100 hours. Next up: scaling to 1 m² modules, with demo units planned for Q1 2026. And roll-to-roll tests at the Henry Royce Institute show the concept can stretch to industrial volumes.Historical MomentumFor too long, electrode tech was the choke point inelectrolysis. Early alkaline and PEM systems leaned on clunky metal foams with limited active area. Nanostructured fixes have popped up in journals over the past decade, but few ever made the leap from lab to factory. M-Spin’s mesh fuses nanoscale engineering with manufacturing pragmatism—just as Europe’s Hydrogen Strategy and the UK’s Ten Point Plan unlock over £1 billion forsustainable energyandindustrial decarbonizationprojects.Competitive LandscapeIt’s a crowded arena: legacy electrolyser makers still rely on sintered foams and mesh from big suppliers like Linde, while a handful of start-ups in Germany and the US chase nano-coated or laser-etched electrodes. M-Spin’s edge? A native nanofiber network that skips costly coatings and extra post-processing steps. In plain English, that means a lower cost per square meter of electrode—critical when you’re rolling out multi-gigawatt installations.Market OutlookGlobal electrolysis capacity is poised to leap from under 2 GW today to over 100 GW by 2030, driven by net-zero pledges and booming renewables. Annual hydrogen market revenues could top $300 billion by mid-decade. In that landscape, a 20–30% capex cut in electrolysers translates into tens of billions saved. For early movers like M-Spin, that’s a shot at serious market share—provided the performance and durability live up to expectations.Technical HurdlesThe real test lies in long-haul durability: corrosion resistance, mechanical fatigue under cyclical loads, and survival in harsh alkaline or acidic environments. M-Spin’s 100-hour runs are a promising start, but 10,000-hour data will make or break their levelized cost-of-hydrogen models. And building roll-to-roll modules means nailing thermal management and seal integrity to prevent membrane damage and gas crossover.Collateral ImpactsIf this nanomesh delivers, the ripple effects could reshape multiple sectors:Heavy industry:Green hydrogenat $1.50–2.00/kg could finally decarbonize steel, refining and ammonia.Ammonia production:Lower energy inputs might cut fertilizer costs—a boon for global food security.Mobility:Fuel cell fleets become more cost-effective as fuel expenses drop.Energy storage:More efficient electrolyser-capacitor hybrids smooth out renewable intermittency.Supply chains:Demand for nickel, copper and ceramics spikes, fueling upstream investment.Fuel cell tech:These mesh designs could boost electrode performance in fuel cell mode too.Beyond just cutting costs, these shifts fuel broadersustainable energyadoption and underscorehydrogen’s role in industrial decarbonization.Main InsightsPrototypes show up to5× higher hydrogen outputand20–30% cost reduction, according to M-Spin—results that look great but still need independent verification.Roll-to-roll processing combined with retrofit compatibility slashes deployment times compared to greenfield redesigns.Backing from Imperial’s spin-out ecosystem and the Henry Royce Institute accelerates iteration cycles and rigorous testing.Next StepsM-Spin is gearing up pilot-scale trials at Imperial’s hydrogen labs to prove multi-thousand-hour durability. They’re negotiating licensing deals with OEMs across Europe and Asia to fast-track market entry, and exploring dual-use mesh designs that work in bothelectrolysisand fuel cell modes—streamlining supply chains for end users.Expert ViewpointFrom where I’m sitting, M-Spin nails a critical balance: a high-performance nanostructure that’s genuinely scalable. The long-duration data will be the ultimate decider, but if they hit their cost and durability targets, expect faster project approvals, bolder offtake deals and a reconfigured investment picture forsustainable energyinfrastructure. Whether you’re an investor hunting for the next big thing inelectrolysisor an operator chasing a lower TCO, M-Spin’s nanomesh deserves a hard look—it just might be the materials breakthrough that pushesgreen hydrogeninto the mainstream.Spread the love Born from seven years of tinkering at Imperial’sEnergy Futures Lab, the founding crew—four PhD chemists and two electrochemical engineers—has already locked down two patent families coveringmetal electrospinning recipesandbinderless mesh architectures.

Instead of polymer or carbon fibers, M-Spin’s R&D team—shout-out to Professor Nigel Brandon’s lab—has dialed in metal-based recipes. Here’s the nutshell version:Fiber diameter:500 nm to 1 µm, balancing toughness with high surface exposure.Porosity:Up to 90%, which smoothed out mass transport of reactants and gas release.Surface area:As much as 1,000× that of metallic foams, multiplying active sites for water splitting—the core ofhydrogen production.Material versatility:Nickel, iron, copper and ceramics—each tuned to specific electrolyser chemistries.In lab-scale trials (50 cm² electrodes), they’ve hit current densities north of industry benchmarks, running stably at 1 A/cm² for more than 100 hours. Next up: scaling to 1 m² modules, with demo units planned for Q1 2026. And roll-to-roll tests at the Henry Royce Institute show the concept can stretch to industrial volumes.Historical MomentumFor too long, electrode tech was the choke point inelectrolysis. Early alkaline and PEM systems leaned on clunky metal foams with limited active area. Nanostructured fixes have popped up in journals over the past decade, but few ever made the leap from lab to factory. M-Spin’s mesh fuses nanoscale engineering with manufacturing pragmatism—just as Europe’s Hydrogen Strategy and the UK’s Ten Point Plan unlock over £1 billion forsustainable energyandindustrial decarbonizationprojects.Competitive LandscapeIt’s a crowded arena: legacy electrolyser makers still rely on sintered foams and mesh from big suppliers like Linde, while a handful of start-ups in Germany and the US chase nano-coated or laser-etched electrodes. M-Spin’s edge? A native nanofiber network that skips costly coatings and extra post-processing steps. In plain English, that means a lower cost per square meter of electrode—critical when you’re rolling out multi-gigawatt installations.Market OutlookGlobal electrolysis capacity is poised to leap from under 2 GW today to over 100 GW by 2030, driven by net-zero pledges and booming renewables. Annual hydrogen market revenues could top $300 billion by mid-decade. In that landscape, a 20–30% capex cut in electrolysers translates into tens of billions saved. For early movers like M-Spin, that’s a shot at serious market share—provided the performance and durability live up to expectations.Technical HurdlesThe real test lies in long-haul durability: corrosion resistance, mechanical fatigue under cyclical loads, and survival in harsh alkaline or acidic environments.

Bavarian officials inaugurated a new photovoltaic system on State Road 2584 west of Munich Airport near the Hallbergmoos junction this week. Bavarian Minister-President Markus Söder, Transport Minister Christian Bernreiter, and State Chancellery Minister Florian Herrmann attended the opening. The four-lane airport access road has been equipped with 35 meters of solar modules. Installed on the roof, the modules cover about 1,100 square meters, with an additional 135 square meters on the south side. The Bavarian Ministry of Transport estimates the system’s total output at just under 210 kW and the investment at approximately €4.2 million. Construction of the project is scheduled to begin in September 2024. The solar power generated will feed the Freising municipal utility grid and directly power emergency call boxes, traffic counters, and the road’s control technology. The Ministry of Transport said the project will provide insights into the practical feasibility of PV roofing on roads. The goal is to make solar use of infrastructure areas economically viable and support the Bavarian Climate Protection Program. The ministry noted that the PV system generates enough electricity to cover the annual consumption of 70 households. Officials added that roads offer untapped potential for renewable energy generation, combining mobility with energy production while minimizing land use and advancing the energy transition.

Jakson Engineers, part of the energy and infrastructure conglomerate Jakson Group, will invest more than INR 80 billion to build a 6 GW integrated solar module, cell, and wafer manufacturing plant at Maksi Phase II in Madhya Pradesh. The project will be developed in two phases on a 110-acre site recently allocated to the company. Site work will begin within 15 days. In Phase I, Jakson will commission 3 GW of solar modules and 3 GW of solar cells with an investment of about INR 20 billion. Phase II will add a 6 GW solar wafer plant and another 3 GW each of modules and cells, with an investment of more than INR 60 billion. The first solar modules from the plant are expected in May 2026, followed by cells in September 2026. “This is a momentous occasion for our company and a major leap forward for India’s renewable energy sector,” said Sundeep Gupta, vice chairman of Jakson Group. “Our investment in Maksi is testament to our unwavering commitment to ‘Make in India’ and directly supports the nation’s ambitious clean energy targets. We are confident that with the support of the Madhya Pradesh government, this plant will become a beacon of technological excellence and a catalyst for creating green jobs.” Gagan Chanana, joint managing director and CEO of Jakson Solar Modules and Cells, noted that global demand for solar energy is rising. Chanana claimed that the company’s integrated “four-in-one” model will help meet India’s energy needs, lower costs, speed technology deployment, and strengthen energy security. Madhya Pradesh was selected for the project because of its central location, infrastructure, investor-friendly environment, and renewable energy policies. The plant is expected to create more than 1,000 jobs during construction and about 1,400 permanent positions once operational. This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

Blackout and crisis preparedness expert Herbert Saurugg analyzed the data for his platform, estimating 2,476 hours above €100/MWh so far this year, compared with 2,310 in 2023. During the energy crisis following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, there were far more peak price phases. Saurugg calculated 7,379 such hours in 2022 and 4,116 in 2023. For operators of large-scale battery storage, whose margins depend on electricity price spreads, these are favorable conditions. Even as several large storage systems are under construction and being connected to the grid in Germany, the market outlook remains unchanged. Expansion of solar and wind power continues, supported by Federal Minister of Economics Katherina Reiche (CDU). RWTH Aachen University’s “Battery Charts” show that about 800 MWh of capacity have been added to large-scale battery storage this year. Researchers now place total large-scale battery storage capacity at 3.0 gigawatt hours. By comparison, the Market Data Register shows almost 8.65 GW of new solar installed in the first seven months of 2024, lifting cumulative photovoltaic capacity above 109 GW in July.

Despite the absence of a legal framework, companies are expanding battery production, diversifying models, and preparing storage to play a central role in the energy transition. Solar deployment has been a success story in Brazil, but the need for more battery energy storage capacity is increasingly urgent. The Brazilian energy storage market is at a turning point. Driven by rising energy bills, the instability of the electricity grid and a search for greater autonomy, the sector is expected to grow exponentially between now and 2030, even in the absence of definitive regulation. The Brazilian Association of Storage Solutions (ABSAE) estimates that the country could reach 25 GW of installed capacity and attract BRL 44 billion ($8 billion) in investments during this period. The combination of distributed generation, electromobility, extreme weather events, and pressure for energy reliability is shaping a new demand profile that requires scalable, flexible and economically viable solutions. Against this backdrop,pv magazine Brasilreached out to executives from companies operating in the country to understand their plans regarding technology and industrial development, as well as the challenges they face.

They catalogued a sampling of twenty-five commercially available 4 mm connectors. Examples of 4 mm single-pole DC PV connectors representative of those currently commercially available Image: NREL, Solar Energy, CC BY 4.0 A group of researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy'sNational Renewable Energy Laboratory(NREL) andSandia National Laboratorieshas created a standardized terminology for PV connectors in an effort to reduce confusion and offer best practices for their deployment. In the study “Standardized nomenclature for photovoltaic connectors,” which was recently published inSolar Energy, the scientists explained that terms like “MC4-compatible” and “cross-mating,” for example, are often a source of potential installation faults. “Given the critical role of PV connectors and the consequences of their failure, the authors of this paper believe a common understanding of connector components and their functions is essential,” the scientists stated, noting that no common language currently exists to define either the components or their functions. “The present lack of standardization can cause confusion and potentially lead to improper installations, diagnoses, or maintenance practices.” Their work consisted initially of quantifying the existing nomenclature and then suggesting terms for components without misleading implications. Then they created a catalog of twenty-five 4 mm PV connectors that are available in the market. For their survey, which included 33 respondents from the PV industry and the scientific community, they used publicly available product documents from 20 manufacturers and data from the International Photovoltaic Quality Assurance Task Force (PVQAT). The manufacturer documents comprised schematics, datasheets, installation manuals, catalogs, and relevant patents. The proposed terms were chosen based on their functionality, avoidance of confusion, prevalence of use, and effectiveness. “Feedback from installers and O&M personnel was strongly considered in discussions regarding the effectiveness of the terminology,” the research team specified, adding that their focus was on key components such as housings, locking tab, locking slot, O-ring, gland nut, cable grip, cable seal, socket, pin, contact spring, contact retainer, contact barbs, and cable crimp. Their work also included identifying those terms that could potentially cause confusion and suggesting not to use them. “Our hope is that the solar industry will adopt this recommended nomenclature to improve communication and reduce misunderstandings that could lead to unintended adverse consequences,” the academics concluded.

Brussels-based 3E, a SaaS and advisory company for the renewable energy sector, has reported a new breakthrough from its EU-funded Flexible Utility-Scale Energy Storage (FULLEST) project, developed in partnership with the Free University of Brussels (VUB), revealing a critical oversight in how utility-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) are managed across Europe. The research shows that up to 80% of operators rely solely on battery management systems (BMS) to assess system health, which can potentially mask signs of degradation. In one pilot project, 3E’s digital twin technology detected a 4% discrepancy between reported and actual battery health – enough to shift dispatch decisions, affect warranty claims, and impact long-term revenue. Such blind spots pose not just technical challenges, but growing financial and system-level risks. To continue reading, please visit ourESS Newswebsite.

With total capacity rising to 190 GW by March 2027 amid limited export opportunities, the market faces oversupply risks. India’s solar module manufacturing capacity has reached about 100 GW, enough to meet annual domestic demand assuming an effective utilization-to-nameplate ratio of 55% to 65%, according to a report by SBICAPS. However, with total module capacity projected to rise to 190 GW by March 2027, concerns of oversupply are emerging, particularly amid shrinking export opportunities, especially to the United States. Solar power installations in India rose 60% year-on-year in fiscal year 2025, reaching roughly 24 GW. This required about 50 GW DC of modules, based on typical DC/AC overloading ratios of 1.2 to 1.4. The report estimates annual additions will rise to 40 GW to 50 GW through fiscal year 2030 to meet the country’s solar targets, implying a steady-state need of around 100 GW of module manufacturing capacity. However, with cumulative capacity expected to reach 190 GW by 2027 and export prospects narrowing – particularly following recent US policy changes – an oversupply scenario appears likely. India exported just 4 GW of modules in fiscal year 2025, a year-on-year decline largely attributed to regulatory changes in the United States. “US administration issued a directive to halt funding from the IRA. The subsequent enactment of the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ is expected to phase out investment tax credits and production tax credits for solar and wind projects,” the report notes. “This has reduced exports of modules from India to the US – the major export destination for Indian modules. In response, some players are setting up factories there, to adjust to the new FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) rules,” said the report. Contrasting the maturity in modules, solar cell capacity in India is just 26 GW DC – less than one-third of module capacity – implying import dependence in the near term. However, the report highlights that cell capacity is set to grow rapidly with the implementation of ALMM-II. Under the ALMM-II order, only cells from approved manufacturers may be used for projects with bid submissions after Aug. 31, 2025. Additionally, only ALMM cells and modules may be used for projects benefiting from net metering or open access rules, a move that will open up the significant commercial and industrial market to domestic players. Planned capacity additions are expected to take cell capacity close to self-sufficiency in the medium term, with total 115 GW DC of cell capacity projected by March 31, 2027. In the interim, higher prices for DCR cells could push up project costs until supply-demand dynamics readjust, potentially reducing bid enthusiasm.

According to AEMO’s new2025 Electricity Statement of Opportunitiesreport, battery energy storage systems demonstrate the highest reliability, with approximately 70% of the NEM’s fleet having experienced unplanned outage rates of only 0-5%. It adds that longer-duration storage, defined as 4-hours or more, is more effective at reducing reliability risks than shorter-duration storage. This is because in 2030-31, expected USE in South Australia is forecast to exceed the reliability standard, with some shortfall events lasting more than four hours. In such conditions, AEMO said 2-hour battery storage systems are typically exhausted early, providing no reliability benefits for later hours of the forecast USE event. By contrast, longer duration storage can sustain output over a larger portion or even across the full duration of these USE events. Energy storage continues to emerge as a critical component of Australia’s energy transition strategy. AEMO’s report reveals various storage durations and their effectiveness in meeting reliability standards, providing crucial insights for developers and policymakers. Indeed, several different technology combinations in South Australia could be sought to help reduce expected unserved energy (USE) and meet reliability standards by 2030-31. For instance, AEMO states that 820MW of 2-hour storage would be required to reduce expected USE to meet the reliability standard. In contrast, less than half that capacity is needed if the storage has a duration of 4-hours or more – specifically, 365MW of 4-hour storage would suffice. The report also demonstrates that longer-duration storage options could provide increasingly efficient solutions: 6-hour duration storage, for example, would require 320MW. In contrast, 8-hour storage would need approximately 315MW to achieve the same reliability outcomes. According to AEMO, hybrid configurations show even greater efficiency gains. When wind is combined with 4-hour duration energy storage, the requirement drops to 295MW of storage co-located with 590MW of wind generation. Similarly, solar PV combined with 4-hour storage would require 285MW of energy storage alongside 570MW of solar. The most efficient configuration examined involves a combination of wind, solar and 4-hour storage, requiring 280MW of storage, 555MW of wind and 140MW of solar.

В прошлом году компания показывала рекордные результаты как за первое полугодие, так и по итогам всего года. Несмотря на снижение показателя, в компании оценивают результаты положительно, подчёркивая, что падение прибыли оказалось менее заметным, чем динамика мировых цен на нефть (Brent упала с $71 до $63 за бочку в сравниваемые периоды). В корпоративном отчёте отмечается, что операционная рентабельность в первом полугодии превысила прогнозы, при этом все направления бизнеса остались прибыльными. Восьмой год подряд компания намерена наращивать объёмы добычи нефти и газа, что соответствует политике Пекина по сокращению зависимости от зарубежных энергоресурсов в условиях усиливающейся геополитической напряжённости. Капвложения за шесть месяцев достигли 64 млрд юаней, а объём добычи составил 924 млн баррелей нефтяного эквивалента, что на 2% выше прошлогоднего уровня. PetroChina сумела выиграть на фоне растущего внутреннего спроса на газ, который считается более экологичным топливом и играет ключевую роль в процессе энергетического перехода Китая. Газовое подразделение принесло компании 18,6 млрд юаней прибыли против 16,8 млрд годом ранее на фоне ослабления нефтеперерабатывающего сегмента. Подразделение по переработке нефти, химии и новых материалов зафиксировало 11,1 млрд юаней прибыли по состоянию на июнь, тогда как год назад показатель составлял 13,6 млрд юаней. Тем не менее, аналитики указывают, что компания способна извлечь выгоду из мер правительства, направленных против налоговых нарушений и избыточных мощностей, нацеленных на небольшие частные НПЗ. Сектор добычи, в который входят и проекты в сфере возобновляемой энергетики, обеспечил прибыль в размере 85,7 млрд юаней. Это меньше результата прошлого года (91,7 млрд юаней), однако более низкие затраты на добычу на суше позволили снизить стоимость сырья для НПЗ, что дало компании конкурентное преимущество перед игроками, зависящими от импорта. © Все права защищены.

Researchers at the University of South Australia and Deakin University in Victoria have found that households with solar panels gain more benefits from using peer-to-peer (P2P) energy sharing. Acting as “prosumers,” they can sell surplus power to neighbors, support grid stability and secure higher returns than current retailer feed-in tariffs. The researchers said the role of prosumers is becoming more important as nearly 40% of Australian households, or4.1 million homes, use rooftop solar. The influx of excess energy is overloading the grid and driving down feed-in tariffs, raising questions about the economic value of the technology. The study used real-world data from a 10 kW solar-powered home in Geelong, 75 km southwest of Melbourne. It simulated energy generation, consumption and sharing across four models over 12 months, including interactions with three neighboring consumers. They published their results in “Technical and economic analyses of grid-connected residential PV considering batteries and peer-to-peer energy sharing.”The paper compares the different energy models to help householders and energy policymakers design more efficient, community-based solar systems. Researcher Dr. Kevin Wang said modeling showed that under current conditions, P2P energy sharing cut neighbors’ grid electricity use by more than 30%. He said pairing it with a 10 kWh battery delivered the highest return for solar owners over 20 years, at AUD 4,929 ($3,166). “P2P energy sharing delivers significant benefits compared to traditional grid export arrangements, particularly when feed-in tariffs are low,” Wang said.

A solar-plus-storage system has been deployed in the eastern Ukrainian village of Donets to power the local municipality’s water utility. The system features a 30.4 kW solar array supported by a 24 kWh battery energy storage system designed to maintain water pumping operations during grid outages. Donated by charitable foundationRePower Ukraineand humanitarian aid organization Mercy Corps, the system consists entirely of European-manufactured equipment. Donets is located within the Slobozhanske community inUkraine’s eastern Kharkiv region, an area heavily impacted by Russia’s invasion. The Donets municipal water utility serves as the sole source of centralized water supply for 1,500 residents of the local community that has been repeatedly targeted by attacks on energy infrastructure. The facility supplies water to 669 households including 36 apartment buildings, a school, a kindergarten, a medical clinic and local businesses. Prior to the solar installation, most resident payments for water services were consumed by electricity costs, meaning the utility was reliant on municipal subsidies to remain operational. RePower Ukraine said in a statement that residents will now continue to have access to water despite future electricity cut-offs caused by Russia’s shelling of energy infrastructure. The foundation added that the project “exemplifies the strategic advantages of distributed generation in volatile environments.” “By producing electricity at point of consumption, the installation ensures that even significant damage to central energy infrastructure cannot deprive large populations of essential services,” RePower Ukraine added. “This model offers valuable insights for energy professionals considering resilient infrastructure development in challenging markets.” Ukraine deployed500 MWof solar across the first half of 2025, according to provisional figures from the country’s solar association.

Swedendeployed about 430 MW of solar during the first half of 2025, according to figures from the Swedish solar association Svensk Solenergi. Oskar Öhrman, technical manager at the association, toldpv magazinethe figure is 24% lower than 2024 and on par with levels recorded in 2022.He predicted that the market is heading to around 800 MW for the calendar year. Sweden added around1 GWof solar across last year, taking cumulative capacity to just under 5 GW. Among the notable projects to enter operations in Sweden during the first six months of the year was independent power producer Alight's64 MWsite, billed as the country's largest solar project to date, located in the eastern municipality of Hallstavik. Öhrman noted that the Swedish market is seeing a shift from batteries being an obvious add-on to a solar investment, to solar being an obvious add-on to a battery investment.“Just as before, the combination of solar and batteries are given, but now we start to see more often that the battery is the part that motivates the investor,” he explained. Analysis by Svensk Solenergi found that during the first four months of this year, 19,400 people received green tax deductions for batteries in Sweden, 26% more than the amount granted in the same period last year.The association has calculated this figure corresponds to around 11,600 new battery installations during the first four months of 2025, as people living in the same household can apply for the deduction to share the costs. As of June this year, Svensk Solenergi estimated there isbetween 70,000 and 80,000 home batteries in Sweden, compared to around 265,000 solar systems under 20 kW in size, leaving around 70% of home solar owners currently without a battery installation. Sweden’s total battery capacity increased from 80 MW to 610 MW in 2024 but there is a capacity shortage in the local electricity grid impacting larger installations in some parts of the country. Svensk Solenergi said in areportearlier this year that this can lead to long queues for connecting large barriers and in some cases, connections being denied. Öhrman toldpv magazinethat grid connections for batteries must be simplified.“Installing more batteries can mitigate the escalating grid costs and grid congestion, but still the Swedish distribution system operators and transmission system operators have insufficient process for handling batteries, which makes the connections too slow,” he explained.

A group of researchers from the Polytechnic University of Cartagena and the University of Castilla–La Mancha studied real-life self-consumption photovoltaic installations that reflect the current profiles of Spanish prosumers. They evaluated 2,640 generation profiles from rooftop systems with nominal power outputs of 3 kW to 5 kW over a full year of operation. A common trend among installers is the search for the optimal tilt and orientation to maximize output. But it is not always possible to reach these values on all roofs, so they are artificially “targeted.” These non-coplanar installations carry notable drawbacks, including structural complexity, higher costs, and increased roof loads. In contrast, coplanar designs, where modules are aligned with the existing building surface, deliver nearly equivalent generation at significantly lower cost. The study, “Alternative non-optimal orientations in highly PV self-consumption integration: Exploring Spanish prosumers as a case study,” published inRenewable Energy,offers new data on the viability of residential self-consumption photovoltaic installations in a wide range of rooftop configurations. Contrary to the widespread belief that optimal energy production requires precise orientation and tilt, the results show that most existing rooftops can achieve competitive economic performance with their natural geometry. In fact, when system design takes into account household demand profiles and appropriate sizing of peak power, payback periods remain favorable, even comparable to or better than those of conventional optimized configurations, according to the study's authors. Only roofs with extreme, predominantly north-facing slopes present significant performance drawbacks. Once the compensation mechanism has been established, energy prices have been set, and the consumption profile has been selected, the compensation results and the annual savings achieved for each generation profile can be calculated. The annual savings achieved for each generation profile allow for calculating the payback period, i.e., the number of years required to recover the investment cost. The results of this study underscore the potential for wider adoption of photovoltaics without the need for structural modifications, reinforcing the feasibility of leveraging existing rooftop conditions in residential environments. This phenomenon is largely attributed to better temporal alignment between electricity production and domestic consumption during peak tariff hours, especially in time-of-use and self-consumption pricing structures with surplus compensation systems. “These results challenge the traditional paradigm that maximizing energy production should be the primary design objective for small-scale photovoltaic systems,” the authors explain. Instead, they support a more nuanced approach that prioritizes the system's economic performance, taking into account both market price variability and the self-consumption ratio. “Furthermore, the data presented highlight the importance of evolving remuneration mechanisms to fairly compensate prosumers, not only based on the volume of energy injected into the grid, but also on the temporal and systemic value of their contribution to local distribution networks,” they add. The scientists suggest that policymakers rethink the design of support programs and regulatory frameworks: “Traditional policies have tended to reward total energy generation, but this work shows that this approach may not be consistent with optimal grid integration or economic efficiency. Instead, policy instruments that incentivize demand-driven system design and reward local self-consumption, such as dynamic tariffs, smart metering incentives, or capacity-based subsidies, are recommended. These initiatives could accelerate PV deployment and reduce pressure on the grid,” they conclude. Finally, for system operators and grid planners, the study highlights the role that decentralized, demand-synchronized PV systems can play in stabilizing local grids and improving load management. In this context, the methodology provides a valuable tool for assessing the potential of distributed generation—that is, when and how energy is injected into or demanded from the grid.

By contextualizing these results within already matured agrivoltaic jurisdictions globally, the study offers novel insights for regions like Canada, where policy has yet to fully integrate the agrivoltaic potential.” The experiment was conducted in a controlled environment, where conditions in the biomes were representative of outdoor summer in London, Ontario, Canada. Daytime temperatures were maintained at 25 C, while nighttime temperatures were set at 19 C. To supplement illumination during the 16-h daylight phase, four 600 W high-pressure sodium fixtures were used. Seven different transparencies of cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin film solar modules, namely 10%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% and 80%. Six lettuce plants were cultivated under each module, while eight were planted without the modules to act as a control. Image: Western University, Journal of Cleaner Production, CC BY 4.0 “The experimental timeline begins with seeding three plants per pot on Feb. 21, 2024. The first emergence of lettuce plants was observed on day 6, followed by the initial thinning of pots on day 12, reducing pots with three germinated seeds to two plants per pot. Final thinning occurred on day 20, establishing a single plant per pot across all treatments,” the team stated. “Fertilization was commenced on 20 March 2024, with subsequent applications on day 34, day 40, day 44, and day 47. Each pot received 0.75 g of fertilizer dissolved in 0.5 L of water per application.” Measuring the PAR throughout the experiment and the lettuce yield at harvest, the researchers found that the 10% transparency module exhibited the lowest values in both PAR and fresh weight of lettuce. PAR values ranged from 43.75 to 52.34 micromol/m2-s [micromoles, per square meter, per second], while fresh weight varied between less than 1 g and 15 g. The 80% transparency module yielded the most favorable outcomes, with PAR values ranging from 70.31 to 117.19 micromol/m2-s, and fresh weight spanning from 34 to 424 g. The mean fresh weight of lettuce harvested from the control treatment was 417 g with a PAR value of 129.69 micromol/m2s. Using those results, the team has tested the worthiness of growing lettuce under PV panels in four European markets. They checked Germany, where regulation rule that the crop should keep at least 66% of its yield; in France, were crops have to maintain 90% of their yield; in Itay, where a maximum PV land coverage of 40% is set; and in the Czech Republic, where only 10% are allowed to be covered by PV. “One of the most surprising outcomes was the degree to which agrivoltaic policies could influence land use decisions and overall adoption,” said Jamil. “Our findings indicate that PV system design and module configuration not only directly affect crop yields but also have broader implications for how policymakers might incentivize or restrict agrivoltaic integration, highlighting the critical role of policy design in maximizing both energy and food production.” The results of the study indicated that a minimum yield requirement could be set at 70%. This means that the German policy appears to be the most consistent with available data for maximizing agrivoltaic benefits while minimizing detriment. “More importantly, policy makers should consider the use of dynamic mandates with a review cycle, i.e., 5 years minimum, to ensure policy alignment with evolving technological trends and agricultural practices,” the academics concluded. Their findings were presented in “Photosynthetically active radiation complexities in agrivoltaic policy mandates: Insights from controlled environment yields under semitransparent photovoltaics,” published in theJournal of Cleaner Production.

Legislation A5267/S4289 introduces a transmission-scale energy storage incentive programme, aiming to meet New Jersey’s target of 2,000MW of energy storage by 2030. This initiative seeks to expedite the installation of new clean energy capacity and lower costs for New Jersey’s energy customers. Under S4530/A5768, the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) will launch registration for an additional 3,000MW of community solar projects on 1 October 2025. The governor’s office says this move will significantly expand New Jersey’s solar initiatives, enabling families and businesses to reduce their monthly electric bills. These pieces of legislation enable the rapid expansion of New Jersey’s community solar programme and the swift creation of new energy storage facilities. Under the Murphy Administration, solar PV generation capacity has increased from 2.4GW to 5.2GW, with solar now powering over 600,000 homes. The governor’s office claims that rising energy costs in the state result from mismanagement by the regional grid operator, PJM. Murphy has also called for a formal investigation “into the energy cost crisis facilitated by PJM,” announced US$430 million in direct relief for New Jersey ratepayers, sent a bipartisan letter demanding transparency and oversight from PJM, and signed legislation increasing public accountability from grid operators. In June,the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) approved the first phase of the Garden State Energy Storage Programme (GSESP). At the time, the NJBPU noted that the speed at which energy storage systems (ESS) can be built is crucial, as the state cannot build “traditional” power plants within five years due to supply chain issues. Senator Smith, Chair of the Senate Energy Committee, said of the legislation: “By incentivising and procuring the creation of transmission-scale energy storage, we will enable a wider application of clean energy that can charge and store energy at low-cost hours then discharge at high-cost, high-demand hours, thus lowering overall costs and smoothing demand spikes on the grid.” Smith continued, “This legislation will help keep New Jersey at the forefront of investments in new, clean energy technology, even as the current federal administration seeks to sabotage our environment and our renewable future.”", "relevance_reason": "Найдено 2 ключевых слов"}, "channel_id": "-1002996332660"}, "867195bab8b65fbd": {"message_id": null, "news_data": {"title": "Megawatts are not enough anymore for leading US BESS markets", "url": "https://www.energy-storage.news/megawatts-are-not-enough-anymore-for-leading-us-bess-markets/", "date": "2025-08-26 13:02", "source": "Energy Storage News", "preview": "Megawatts are not enough anymore for leading US BESS markets After an initial rush to deploy that gave CAISO and ERCOT the lead in US BESS adoption, both markets are focused on capacity and availability, writes Amit Mathrani of Rabobank Americas.

Battery energy storage has sprinted from niche experiment to indispensable grid asset in barely half a decade. Nowhere is that transformation clearer than in California and Texas. By the end of 2024, the California ISO (CAISO) operated 12.5GW of utility-scale battery capacity, up from just 1GW in 2020, while the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) surged from essentially 0.5GW to 10GW over the same period. Together, these two markets now host a little more than 65% of all US grid-connected battery storage capacity (see Figure 1 below). The similarities end with scale. CAISO’s build-out has been propelled by policy mandates and long-term Resource Adequacy (RA) contracts that favour 4-hour duration, close to urban load centres. ERCOT’s boom, by contrast, has unfolded in a pure merchant setting, with no capacity market, minimal regulatory guardrails, and revenues earned (or lost) in real-time energy and ancillary service markets. The result is a dual stress test on the same technology. California now grapples with revenue compression and interconnection logjams, Texas with price cannibalisation, transmission bottlenecks, and a push towards multi-hour discharge. These contrasts preview the grid’s next chapter. Duration is edging out volume, siting advantage now beats speed, and investors increasingly prize fluency with evolving policy rules and flawless operations. Other ISOs – PJM, MISO, NYISO – are already importing elements of both playbooks. To see where battery economics and grid planning are headed next, let’s start with California and Texas. California and Texas share the same headline: double-digit-gigawatt battery fleets built in record time. However, the mechanics behind that growth could not be further apart. CAISO’s 12.5GW of operating BESS is the product of a policy-catalysed glide path: mid-term reliability mandates such as the California Public Utilities Commission’s (CPUC) 15.5GW of clean capacity by 2027, a 4-hour resource adequacy standard that underpins long-term offtake contracts, and interconnection reforms that now screen projects for site control and deliverability before they enter detailed study. By Contrast, ERCOT’s 10GW of operating capacity has been built almost entirely without mandates, capacity payments, or federal oversight. Early projects were mostly 1-hour systems chasing ancillary service revenue. Currently, the fleet averages 1.5-2 hours, and the queue mix is expected to shift toward 4-hour duration ahead of the Dispatchable Reliability Reserve Service (DRRS) launch in ERCOT in 2026 to compensate resources that can provide at least four hours of continuous energy during emergency conditions, supporting system stability without requiring formal capacity obligations. For investors, the divergence frames a strategic spectrum: from California’s contract-anchored, lower-beta returns to Texas’s volatility-driven, higher-beta upside. Understanding where a new market will sit on that spectrum is now the opening question in any storage diligence process. Batteries that earn today sit where the grid needs relief – nodes defined by congestion, scarcity and price spikes. Interconnection headroom and transmission topology decide which projects reach commercial operation and which languish in restudy, with no developer enthusiasm. Southern California still remains attractive to battery storage developers. As of April 2025, SP-15 hosts more than 51GW of storage requests, over three times the capacity queued in either ZP-26 or NP-15. The sheer weight of applications has forced CAISO to rewrite its interconnection rulebook. In response to FERC’s Order 2023, CAISO’s May 2025 tariff amendment now requires every new requester to prove 90% site control on Day One and 100% before signing a Large Generator Interconnection Agreement [1, 2]. Projects that miss the market drop to the back of the line. A parallel reform introduces a screening stage that ranks projects on viability and alignment with state resource plans before they enter full study. History justifies the clampdown. As Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s (LBNL’s)Queued Up 2024survey showed, only 12% of CAISO requests submitted between 2000 and 2018 reached commercial operation, the lowest build rate among US ISOs. Each late-stage withdrawal triggers restudies that delay the rest of the cluster, raising carrying costs and eroding tax-credit timing. Investors now treat queue position and deliverability status as hard diligence gates, equal to offtake strength. Transmission headroom is equally selective. CAISO’s 2024-2025 Transmission Plan identifies US$4.8 billion in upgrades, but most come online after 2029, leaving near-term projects exposed to local congestion, especially around solar-heavy Kern and Fresno counties. ERCOT still moves projects from application to energisation in 18-30 months. Lightning speed by ISO standards. However, geography is beginning to narrow the fast lane. The 2024 ERCOT Constraints & Needs report lists the Tonkawa Switch – Morgan Creek 345kV path as the single most expensive constraint on the system, absorbing US$156 million in congestion rent between October 2023 and November 2024. The broader West Texas Export Interface booked US$148 million over the same period, and ERCOT’s economic forecast shows rents rising to US$178 million in 2026 without new wires. Batteries sited behind those bottlenecks often clear into the real-time market but collect a discounted nodal price. Houston, once considered congestion-proof, is not immune. Projected constraints in the North-Houston Interface reach US$46 million in annual congestion rent by 2026. ERCOT has endorsed a US$2.2 billion pipeline of upgrades, yet most will enter service after 2027, meaning today’s queue will energise into tomorrow’s pinch-points. Sponsors installing batteries on the load side of a popular constraint are starting to price nodal basis risk the way wind developers priced curtailment a decade ago. For developers and lenders, congestion risk now shapes deal terms as much as project size. Lenders are paying closer attention to site control, deliverability studies, and nodal-price hedging, knowing that a project stuck behind a constraint can miss the very spreads its model assumed. At the federal level, this year’s Independence Day celebrations brought clarity. The ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act’ left the 30% standalone storage ITC, created by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), intact through 2032 – no phase downs, no haircut. The catch is provenance. Starting in 2028, battery cells or packs with more than 30% ‘foreign entity of concern’ (FEOC) content lose the credit, and the 15% Section 301 tariff reinstated in May for Chinese lithium-ion cells remains in force. Tax equity is safe, but only for projects that can document an increasingly domestic supply chain. Policy still leaves plenty of runway for storage, but the path isn’t straight anymore. Anyone building or financing battery storage projects under these policy crosswinds now spends as much time following committee hearings and tariff dockets as they do watching price curves. The question for storage assets has shifted from, “Can the BESS project make money?” to, “Can it keep that revenue once SoC rules, outage penalties, insurance costs and degradation kick in?” Operational discipline now drives the gap between a deal that meets pro-forma and one that backpedals on covenants. CAISO has required 4-hour batteries to hold a minimum reserve going into the evening ramp. The rule was supposed to sunset in 2024; instead, the ISO extended it through 2026 while it evaluates longer-term reliability options. The extension means storage resources must hold energy through the late afternoon peak with a preset charge margin or face potential bidding restrictions and availability penalties. At the same time, availability risk is widening. CAISO’s Q4 2024 Market Issues & Performance Report shows battery outages, planned and forced, rose 26% Y-o-Y, reflecting both rapid fleet expansion and longer downtimes for fire safety retrofits. The most public reminder came on January 2025, when a thermal runaway event at Vistra’s 300MW Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility forced a three-month outage and community air-quality monitoring. While no injuries occurred, the incident hardened lender and insurer attitudes overnight. Verisk – Munich Re highlight tighter underwriting criteria for lithium projects lacking dedicated setbacks or advanced suppression. Performance penalties compound those cost pressures. In a typical CAISO 4-hour Resource Adequacy contract, a single missed dispatch during a system stress hour can forfeit an entire month of capacity payments. An outcome that now carries more weight than day-ahead spread assumptions in many debt models. Sponsors respond by investing in redundant battery-management telemetry, automated SoC forecasting, and additional fire suppression layers that push EPC budgets up by 2-3% but protect far larger revenue streams. Texas presents a different operational gauntlet. ERCOT’s merchant batteries cycle more frequently, often three to four times per day during shoulder seasons, to capture brief price spikes that still emerge between solar oversupply and evening peaks. High-cycle operation accelerates degradation. Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) packs rated at 10,000 cycles see usable energy fall below 80% of nameplate in seven years under ERCOT’s dispatch pattern, compared with ten years in CAISO’s less frenetic market, according to performance warranties filed with two recent interconnection agreements. That degradation matters because ERCOT’s forthcoming DRRS imposes a 4-hour continuous-discharge requirement. Sponsors that fall short risk losing DRRS eligibility unless they augment mid-life with new modules. In a market where spreads compress faster than projects retire, operational proof is becoming the last lever left to protect asset value. Battery storage’s first phase was a land-grab for megawatts. The second is proving to be a contest of selective discipline. Together, California and Texas host roughly 60% of all US grid-connected capacity, offering a preview of what the rest of the country will soon confront. From their experience, five strategic signals stand out. Duration premiums harden quickly once price spikes fade.ERCOT’s ELCC tables already value 5-hour systems at nearly five times the dependable capacity of 1-hour units; CPUC modelling now assumes 8-hour resources enter by 2030. Markets that still reward 1-hour batteries are living on borrowed time. Deliverability trumps queue position.CAISO’s viability screen and Texas’ looming congestion bottlenecks mean a smaller, well-sited project can secure cheaper capital than a larger asset stuck behind a restudy or constraint. Rule-defined revenues outlast merchant spreads.4-hour Resource Adequacy in California and the forthcoming 4-hour DRRS product in Texas have replaced opportunistic arbitrage as the anchor cash flow. Future markets—PJM’s capacity reforms, MISO’s seasonal accreditation— are heading the same way. Operational discipline is no longer optional.A single missed stress-hour dispatch can wipe out a month of RA payments; a thermal event can raise insurance costs across an entire portfolio. Lenders now treat SoC telemetry, fire suppression audits, and augmentation reserves as gating items, not nice-to-haves. Policy risk is a two-sided coin.The ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act’ kept the ITC for storage but tightened the FEOC rules; state legislatures can pivot from laissezfaire to duration mandates in one session. References Hedging that volatility through flexible design, staged capex, and locational optionality will separate resilient balance sheets from speculative bets. Put bluntly, the next phase belongs to those that match hours to need, electrons to the right node, and operations to ever-stricter rulebooks, before the rules tighten further.

The battery regulatory landscape in the EU saw a significant shift in approach on 18 August 2025. The now familiar Directive 2006/66/EC has been repealed with effect from that date. This has significant implications as to who pays for the collection, treatment and recycling of batteries. The shift change is being brought about by Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 which will fully replace Directive 2006/66/EC, and simultaneously it brings into effect on 18 August 2025 new regulations on the management of waste batteries and extended producer responsibilities. The 2023 Regulation introduces enhanced obligations for producers of all categories of batteries such as industrial, SLI (starting, lighting, ignition) and electric vehicle batteries to take back waste batteries regardless of their shape, volume, weight, design, material composition, chemistry, use or purpose. These new obligations aim to improve sustainability, transparency, and circularity in battery use and disposal. The financial responsibility of the producer for the recycling of used batteries is expressed in recitals 101 and 106 of the 2023 Regulation. This provides that “producers should have extended producer responsibility for the management of their batteries at the end-of-life stage. Accordingly, they should finance the costs of collecting, treating and recycling all collected batteries, carrying out compositional surveys of mixed collected municipal waste, reporting on batteries and waste batteries, and of providing information to end-users and waste operators about batteries and appropriate re-use and management of waste batteries…” Producers (in the EU market) therefore will have the responsibility to finance the costs of collection, treatment and recycling, of batteries. Importantly the 2023 Regulation does not expressly deal with contractual transfer of the cost of recycling to the end-user / or buyer (as was possible previously); such attempts to transfer costs may prove to be inadmissible (not allowed). Of course, the 2023 Regulation permits producers to itemise these costs at the point of sale (that is to build in the price at the supply contract or EPC contract price stage), however it remains questionable how feasible this is to do. How can costs be projected years ahead, within what could be a very different regulatory landscape? By contrast UK’s Waste Batteries and Accumulators Regulations 2009 (“WBAR 2009”) is based on the earlier Directive 2006/66/EC, where producers are obliged to take back batteries from end users within a reasonable time if they are producers in the compliance period when the request for take back is made. WBAR 2009, however, continues to facilitate contractual cost sharing in respect of the take-back costs of the producer. This means the UK position will now diverge from the EU position. We think that this can provide legal and commercial complexities for producers operating in the EMEA market. While some producers may seek to recover recycling costs through upfront pricing mechanisms, this approach will be difficult to implement in a price sensitive market, and vulnerable to legal scrutiny if it undermines the 2023 Regulation’s free-of-charge take-back obligation. We’re therefore likely to see varied practices in respect of how producers deal with end-of-life costs. We expect these could involve contract price adjustments, reimbursement mechanisms (which will need to be scrutinised by legal teams including those of investors undertaking due diligence), or provisions that are situated within severability provisions. Given that battery regulations can be updated and changed over the operational lifetime of a battery, the regulatory landscape could of course also change between now and then. Breaches of the EU Directive could of course have local law implications as the Directive is implemented. The EU-UK juxtaposition also creates practical challenges for businesses operating across both jurisdictions. While UK producers may contractually allocate recycling costs, EU producers will need to be seen to absorb them entirely.

The UK-headquartered company’s playbook involves developing large-scale standalone BESS assets in Europe and Australia. Pacific Green describes these developments as Energy Storage Parks, and in Australia in particular, most of its targeted opportunities are planned to have more than a gigawatt-hour of storage capacity per site. Its latest move is to get financing commitments from Australian private debt investment manager Longreach Credit Investors and non-profit investment fund Australian Philanthropic Services Foundation. The investors have agreed to provide the financing over a 24-month period. Pacific Green said it would go towards developing a 7GWh project pipeline and expanding the company’s platform within the booming Australian market. “This capital allows Pacific Green to expand our platform footprint and accelerate the development of our portfolio of BESS projects across the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM),” Pacific Green CEO Scott Poulter said. Battery storage systems are the clean energy technology with the highest levels of reliability, according to the new edition of the annualElectricity Statement of Opportunitiesreport from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), which came out a few days ago. Pacific Green was founded in 2016 and was active in marine exhaust scrubbing machinery before entering the energy storage space two years later. In 2021, it acquired the battery storage consulting business of Limejump, the UK-headquartered energy trader and BESS optimiser, the rest of which was bought up by Shell. The developer then acquired the rights to its first two projects, both in the UK, a few months later. The first of those two projects, the99.8MW/99.8MWh Richborough Energy Park in southern England, went online in late 2023, while the other, 250MW/375MWh Sheaf Energy Park is currently under construction on adjacent land. Its BESS supplier to Richborough was Chinese battery manufacturer Gotion High-Tech. It has since signed a letter of intent (LOI) for thesupply of 1,500MWh of systems at Energy Parks “across multiple jurisdictions” from Trina Storage, the BESS arm of Chinese solar major Trinasolar. In Australia, Pacific Green announced its ‘strategic entry’ into the market in October 2023 withmoves to secure land for 1GW/2.5GWh of Energy Parks in Victoria, which, at the time, it had hoped to move into construction during 2024 for commercial operation to start in 2026.

These projects are expected to be operational before 31 December 2029. Successful bidders in Tender 3 will enter into a Capacity Investment Scheme Agreement (CISA), which provides a revenue safety net through an underwriting approach. “There will be many more projects, many more battery energy storage systems (BESS) being supported by the Capacity Investment Scheme,” Mueller adds. Alongside the CIS initiative, which has been instrumental in scaling energy storage and renewable energy generation across Australia, withWestern Australia also featuring in the scheme, ASL, formerly AEMO Services, before its rebranding last month, is also supporting New South Wales in a new firming tender. “We are preparing for a 500MW firming tender in New South Wales. The focus is for projects to provide energy into the region of New South Wales, and projects need to be operational by the summer of 2027 to participate in that tender,” Mueller said. The500MW tender was first announcedby the New South Wales minister for climate change and energy, Penny Sharpe, at the Clean Energy Council’s Australian Clean Energy Summit 2025 in Sydney last month. The competitive tender process is targeting projects that must be operational by 2028. It will specifically focus on the Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong areas where capacity shortfalls areforecast to occur beginning in the summer of 2027-28. Regarding the 500MW firming tender, Mueller added that ASL is “very keen on receiving bids from aggregated portfolios of smaller batteries, because they usually have a shorter return.” Last month, the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) has announced plans to run four Capacity Investment Scheme tenders by the end of 2025. These will be for theNational Electricity Market (NEM), which spans Australia’s eastern and southern coasts and Tasmania, and theWholesale Electricity Market (WEM), which covers Western Australia. The tenders will be evenly split between the two markets, with each set to have a generation and dispatchable tender. Tenders 5 and 6, specific to the WEM, will begin in August 2025. Tenders 7 and 8, for the NEM, will commence in September and November, respectively. It is worth noting that aconsultation on the design of the CIS tender in the WEM ran earlier this year, and the feedback will guide future rounds.", "relevance_reason": "Найдено 2 ключевых слов"}, "channel_id": "-1002996332660"}, "b25cb60e30ee803d": {"message_id": null, "news_data": {"title": "NextEra Energy Resources receives approval for 200MW Utah BESS", "url": "https://www.energy-storage.news/nextera-energy-resources-receives-approval-for-200mw-utah-bess/", "date": "2025-08-25 13:06", "source": "Energy Storage News", "preview": "NextEra Energy Resources receives approval for 200MW Utah BESS Independent power producer (IPP) NextEra Energy Resources (NEER) has received approval from the Utah Inland Port Authority (UIPA) for its 200MW battery energy storage system (BESS) in Salt Lake City, Utah, US.

The project will be developed in the Northwest Quadrant Project Area in Salt Lake City, adjacent to the Rocky Mountain Power Terminal Substation. NEER is operating the project through its subsidiary Dominguez Energy Storage, LLC. UIPA states that the project aims to improve the region’s power infrastructure by offering extra capacity during peak demand periods, while also promoting a more sustainable energy mix for the state. UIPA’s support includes a proposed annual property tax rebate, available upon project completion. Depending on the facility’s operational status and adherence to certain conditions, such as minimal water usage and a corporate stewardship plan, the rebate can continue for up to 25 years. At a previous UIPA board meeting, Glenn Shober, project director at NEER, clarified that Dominguez Energy Storage would serve not only the Salt Lake area but also provide a reliable energy resource for industries with around-the-clock operations. On 1 May 2024, the UIPA Incentives Committee reviewed and recommended this incentive. The board’s approval is considered a crucial step in advancing the project, allowing NEER to move forward with the development of Dominguez Energy Storage.

Despite some utilities in the US shelving plans for additional BESS,such as Louisville Gas and Electric Company (LG&E) and Kentucky Utilities Company (KU), PNM is seeking regulatory approval of the new portfolio with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC). The utility is targeting 100% emissions-free electricity generation by 2040. As explained in recent documents filed with the NMPRC, PNM is seeking a certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) to install 6MW/24MWh individual BESS facilities at five of its operational solar plants located in five different counties across the state. The portfolio is the result of an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) RFP which the utility issued earlier this year in January for suppliers to deliver the portfolio. Details of the five PNM-owned solar sites to be retrofitted with BESS can be found below: After receiving bids from three suppliers, PNM negotiated a deal with Albuquerque, New Mexico-based EPC specialist Gridworks, which will deliver the project as part of a turnkey solution. As previously reported byEnergy-Storage.news,this isn’t the first time Gridworks has been successful in a PNM-administered RFP,after it secured an EPC contract last year to deliver a 30MW/120MWh co-located BESS for the utility. Recent filings with the NMPRC reveal that the utility included Tesla’s 2XL Megapack in planning documents for the five sites that use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technology. However, this does not necessarily mean Tesla Megapacks will eventually be procured for the project, as planning submissions can indicate an intended design to show regulators and authorities. As explained by PNM as part of its application, LFP technology is “widely recognised as the safest option for utility scale storage due to its minimal risk of thermal runaway compared to chemistries such as nickel manganese cobalt (NMC).” As part of its justification for the project, PNM believes the project will reduce its use of fossil fuels to meet peak system demand while also reducing costs for customers. “By storing excess solar energy for use during peak demand, the BESS reduces curtailment of renewable generation and offsets the historical reliance on fossil-fuelled resources during high-demand periods,” explained Engineering Manager for PNM, Nicholas Pollman, as part of a recent testimony filed with the NMPRC. If operated to its maximum potential, PNM claims the BESS portfolio will eliminate more than 18,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year through the avoidance of equivalent fossil fuel usage. The estimated cost of the installations is approximately US$78.7 million, which PNM plans to recover as part of a future rate case. Of the total estimated cost, Gridworks is set to receive US$71.5 million to “fully design, engineer, and install” the systems’ BESS technology, which will be transferred to PNM upon completion. PNM has requested the NMPRC approve the CPCN no later than May 6 2026 in order to deliver the project by June 2027 in time for the utility’s peak electricity demand which is expected to occur during the summer. With investment tax credits (ITCs) for utility-scale storage havingavoided an early phaseoutdue to last-minute changes to the so-called ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act,’ (‘OBBB’), PNM expects to receive approximately US$28 million in benefits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). PNM has estimated an ITC benefit of 30% – 40% for each project, with the utility expecting all five projects to receive the base 6% credit along with the 24% credit adder for Prevailing Wages & Apprenticeship. It also expects three out of the five to qualify for the additional 10% ‘Energy Communities’ adder. As part of its calculations, PNM excluded the additional 10% ‘Domestic Content’ adder, which it said will only be determined “at the time the batteries and equipment are ordered” for the BESS portfolio. PNM says that any 48E ITC benefit it receives to offset tax liability will be returned to customers. In May, PNM’s parent company, TXNM Energy, agreed to a takeover deal by global asset manager Blackstone Infrastructure. In early 2024, two-yearnegotiations over a merger between PNM and Iberdrola subsidiary Avangrid came to an endwithout a deal following legal delays.", "relevance_reason": "Найдено 3 ключевых слов"}, "channel_id": "-1002996332660"}, "01d55f6050284b95": {"message_id": null, "news_data": {"title": "New community batteries launch in Queensland and Victoria, Australia", "url": "https://www.energy-storage.news/new-community-batteries-launch-in-queensland-and-victoria-australia/", "date": "2025-08-25 02:46", "source": "Energy Storage News", "preview": "New community batteries launch in Queensland and Victoria, Australia Several new community batteries have been launched in Victoria and Queensland, Australia, to soak up distributed solar PV.

The new community batteries have been launched on Phillip Island, located to the south of the state capital, Melbourne, and in the small town of Merland, in the Central Highlands region of Queensland. Six out of seven community batteries have been installed on Phillip Island in Victoria thus far. These battery energy storage systems (BESS) total 900kW/1,845kWh across seven locations on the island, including Cowes and Wimbledon Heights. The batteries are a joint project between Mondo Energy, the commercial arm of network operator AusNet, the Bass Coast Shire Council and Totally Renewable Phillip Island. The Victoria government has confirmed that the community batteries have been delivered as part of its 100 Neighbourhood Batteries Program. This initiative aims to empower communities in Victoria to benefit from rooftop solar PV without requiring individual home battery systems. Through the Neighbourhood Battery Initiative grant programme, the Victorian state government is offering up to AU$400,000 (US$257,095) per project to applicants who can demonstrate multi-use case applications for BESS. Thethird round of this programme launched in July 2025, with AU$6.6 million earmarked for the technology across the state. The initiative covers systems that include a neighbourhood battery, solar PV, a generator, and a management system. Each battery must be a minimum of 20kW/40kWh and a maximum of 5MW/20MWh. Meanwhile, in Queensland, state-owned energy company Energy Queensland has switched on a new 4MW/8MWh community battery in the town of Emerald. According to the Queensland government statement, the community battery is designed to capture the distributed rooftop solar PV systems located across the town. This amounts to around 18.4MW of generation capacity and roughly 28% of the community. Energy Queensland is currently constructing or energizing a new unit in its fleet of 30 local network-connected batteries across the state. These batteries will be utilized for network support, and any excess capacity will be shared with a retailer to trade on the National Electricity Market (NEM). This arrangement aims to maximise the benefits of the battery by reducing both network and wholesale costs. According to the state government, 18 community batteries have already been energised around the State, and 12 more are under construction and on track to be completed this financial year. Queensland’s treasurer and minister for energy, David Janetzki, said increasing the amount of energy in the market would put downward pressure on power prices. “This battery in Emerald is playing a key role in supporting Ergon Energy’s networks to gain the maximum advantage from Queensland’s abundant rooftop solar systems,” Janetzki said. “Each battery enables renewable energy to be stored locally and can support up to 500 homes in the evening peak load period, making better use of locally generated solar power when the sun goes down.” Last week, state-owned utilityWestern Power commissioned five new community batteries in Perth suburbsas part of a federally funded initiative in Western Australia. The organisation confirmed that five community BESS, each 500kW/2,800kWh, have been installed in the suburbs of Coogee, Kinross, Bayswater, Stratton and Port Kennedy.

This comes ahead of an anticipated NÃ¼rburgring run. While most people are not in the market for a hypercar, the extreme application helps to develop EV technology. Most reports indicate that this car uses motors and components shared with theSuper E Platformfound in more approachable cars, like the BYD Han L (that only gets one 500 kW+ motor instead of 4). This platform’s 30,000+ rpm motors with an extremely wide power band likely contribute to the top speed, as well as maintaining performance and efficiency at elevated highway speeds. However, according toCnEVPost,this car will have the “world’s first mass-produced 1200-volt ultra-high voltage platform.” That would also imply more advanced SiC power electronics, which are also typically used to charge the battery in BYD cars. In addition, the 80 kWh LFP Blade Battery being put to the test here is similar to batteries used throughout BYD’s lineup, but with a more advanced cooling system. This also isn’t a one-off prototype, having already filed withMIITfor road certification in China. The development of this car benefits from the transfer of technology from mainstream cars, and mainstream cars can also benefit from technology transfer. Racing can also help to change public opinion. For example, back in the late ’60s and ’70s, at a time when the US was dominated by V8 muscle cars,BRE’sÂ racing of Datsun sedans and sports cars helped to change perceptions of the small, relatively efficient Japanese vehicles. That made people more accepting of the market shift that happened after oil prices shot up. BYD has also been realizing the potential impact of racing on consumer perception. BYD recently opened a massive,“All-Terrain Racing Track”complex in Zhengzhou, letting the company show off performance vehicles and making racing accessible to people who likely have never ridden or driven on a track before. For many people, the most exciting experience they will ever have with a car will be with an EV. People will feel the difference and get to put EVs to the test. In addition, like the Plaid drag racing videos in the US, it will help to take the wind out of ICE bragging rights. While 3000hp+ hypercars setting records can seem pointless to many, the technological development and testing can benefit more practical EVs. Racing can also go a long way toward changing consumer perceptions and building excitement for the transition to electric vehicles. Larry lives in Queens, NY, with his wife and cats.

Accounting for50%of all materials produced globally, domestic production of this critical material is highly energy intensive, while relying on outdated technology and requiring imports of nearly 30 million metric tons of cement a year. In a fast-paced industry like cement and concrete, advancements are needed to modernize domestic production, improve durability, and reduce reliance on imports. Sharing the latest advances in this critical technology and encouraging key conversations among stakeholders is necessary to spark further innovation and support meaningful changes to a well-established industry. In support of this endeavor, NREL, a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratory, recently brought together more than 80 representatives from technology startups, investment firms, academia, industry, corporate institutions, and the national laboratory system in Golden, Colorado, for the third annual NREL Cement and Concrete Critical Technologies meeting on June 9–10. “NREL has the ability to engage the cement and concrete industry at any technology readiness level, from benchtop discovery to implementation, and we serve an important role to the industry as a trusted third-party to provide an honest assessment of new and emerging materials and rapidly transition them to practice,” said John Kevern, an NREL materials science researcher and cohost for this meeting. “There’s no other forum out there for cement and concrete industries to provide relatively direct comments, thoughts, and ideas back to DOE.” This two-day meeting highlighted both the challenges and promising new advances for next-generation cement and concrete technologies. This year’s focus was on the shifting landscape in the cement and concrete industry, with panels and presentations on topics like funding acquisition and venture capital, accelerated performance testing and scaling technologies to field deployment, and a Colorado-focused discussion on how the city and county of Denver, Colorado Department of Transportation, and the state architect are utilizing new procurement methods and commercial and infrastructure projects. “Innovative cement and concrete are critical because they sit at the intersection of infrastructure reliability and economic development,” said Ana Aday, Kevern’s fellow materials science researcher and cohost for this meeting. “As we face growing demands for durable infrastructure due to increased urbanization and aging construction, we need materials that perform better. Advancing new formulations, accelerating testing protocols, and enabling broader adoption of material alternatives is essential for proving out long-term durability of new materials.” In addition to panels and presentations, this year’s event featured an NREL Technology Open House, which showcased the transformative potential of NREL’s emerging technologies in not only cement and concrete but in other critical building materials like iron and steel. Participants also brainstormed in a breakout session, where this wide spectrum of stakeholders engaged in candid discussions, shared knowledge, and generated actionable ideas. “I am thrilled to see the participation of so many industry partners to make this a success,” said NREL laboratory program manager Matthew Ringer. “NREL’s ability to gather the right stakeholders shows the trust they have in this team and the shared desire to drive innovation within the cement and concrete sector.” While cement and concrete may seem like interchangeable terms, cement is the powder that binds materials together to create concrete. In baking terms, cement would be one of the dry ingredients used to make the (concrete) cake. And though cement is only a small portion of what makes up the overall concrete mixture, it is an energy-intensive production that requires modernization to meet the need for new construction and maintenance of existing infrastructure. NREL is leading efforts among the national laboratories to address this through a combination of applied research, demonstration projects, and industry partnerships. These efforts tackle critical needs, such as reducing reliance on imported cement, utilization of novel alternative materials, improving material durability, and accelerating the adoption of next-generation cement and concrete technology solutions. Some of these key initiatives at NREL include developing LignoCrete, a high-carbon cement extender derived from aviation fuel byproducts, which has demonstrated reduced thermal conductivity and good freeze–thaw durability while reducing the amount of cement in the concrete mixtures. NREL is also partnering with startups to transform industrial byproducts into advanced supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) through CO₂ mineralization. Additional research explores 3D-printed concrete for marine environments, the reuse of wind turbine blade residuals in cementitious composites for improvements in thermal and acoustic applications, and the development of “cementless” concrete and lignin-based admixtures. These efforts aim to de-risk new technologies and support the broader deployment of next-generation, resilient construction materials. “The cement and concrete industry, and the architecture and engineering community, are busy and rarely have the time or expertise to thoroughly evaluate new materials. They can become overwhelmed and aren’t able to determine which materials are viable and which are too good to be true,” Kevern said. “At NREL, we like to say this isn’t our first, second, or third rodeo. Sometimes our partners just need someone with experience to help walk them through the application of a new cementitious material or process and provide examples of where others have successfully used something similar.” With so many key players in the fast-moving cement and concrete world in one room, the goal of this meeting was to go beyond simple information sharing and allow NREL and DOE to learn about the pain points or challenges around the research, testing, and implementation needs for next-generation cement and concrete technologies in 2025. By creating a space where industry stakeholders could come together to identify actionable pathways toward accelerated innovation, Aday and Kevern hoped to collectively surface the most pressing technical and institutional barriers, such as the need for faster performance validation, better field data, and alignment around specifications and standards. Based on the depth of discussion and the strong interest in continued collaboration, this workshop successfully laid the groundwork for coordinated action and measurable progress, while NREL remains an important bridge from science to commercial application. “It’s clear that the future is being shaped by the work we do together now and that the momentum the cement and concrete industry has gained of the last few years is still going strong,” Aday said. Whether it’s unleashing domestic cement production, minimizing or eliminating imports, or securing long-term infrastructure resilience and economic growth, communication between professionals making headway in this space is critical to these advances.

While the domestic solar industry is operating under a thick pall of gloom this year, plans are already in the works for a full speed revival leading up to January 20, 2029, when the current occupant of the White House is scheduled to leave the premises — peacefully one hopes, this time. The latest indication of the forthcoming PV renaissance is a new solar factory under construction in North Carolina, on track to commence operations in 2026. Considering the topsey-turvey state of US foreign relations these days, it’s worth noting that the new solar factory comes under the umbrella of the leading global firm Boviet Solar, which is headquartered in Bac Giang City in the northeastern part of Vietnam. Much water has passed under the bridge since the last US combat troops exited Vietnam, back in 1973. “U.S.-Vietnam relationshave become increasingly cooperative and comprehensive, evolving into a flourishing partnership that spans political, economic, security, and people-to-people ties,” the US Department of State noted, following the launch of the 2023 U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The CSP is described as “an overarching framework for advancing the bilateral relationship, and built on preceding Joint Statements issued over the last ten years by the two countries’ leaders in 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017,” the State Department added. Only time will tell if the Trump administration honors both the spirit and the letter of the CSP. As of earlier this summer, at least, the spirit was still in play. On June 20, the US Mission to Vietnam launched a new “30 Years of U.S. – Vietnam Relations” campaign, aimed at reaffirming and expanding ties between the two nations. “Over the past 30 years, the U.S.-Vietnam relationship has grown into a powerful partnership to advance ourshared economic and security goals,” the Mission explained. Speaking of shared economic and security goals, the new solar factory is an excellent demonstration of those things. The economic benefits to the US are straightfroward. In addition to creating new jobs within its walls, a new factory can act as an anchor institution that stirs activity throughout a community and beyond. In particular, a new solar factory has a knock-on effect that ripples into other features of the domestic solar industry, including new jobs related to academic research and technical training as well as hands-on construction and installation employment. Back in January, for example, Boviet cut the ribbon on its first solar factory in North Carolina. Located in Greenville, the sprawling 2-gigawatt solar module factory brought900 new jobsto the state. Among those marking the occasion was North Carolina Governor Josh Stein, who emphasized the big-picture role of the new factory. “As our state grows, so do our energy needs. I look forward to partnering with Boviet Solar to strengthen our workforce and build stronger clean tech infrastructure in North Carolina,” Stein said. “With nearly 110,000 people working in our clean energy sector, North Carolina ranks ninth in the nation for clean energy jobs,” added the state’s Commerce Secretary, Lee Lilley. “Boviet is a powerful addition to our supply chain that includes a roster of 220 solar companies that are helping to provide more low-carbon energy sources.” Boviet’s second solar factory in North Carolina completes the domestic supply chain picture. Also located in Greenville, the new facility will supply made-in-the-US solar cells to the first factory, which commenced operations in April. “Together, these two facilities will create a fully integrated U.S. manufacturing hub, capable ofproducing both PV cells and modules domestically, strengthening America’s solar supply chain while providing customers with top-performing, Made-in-USA solar products,” Boviet explained in a press statement. The company also noted that the second factory was initially planned as a 2-gigawatt facility. Instead, it will reach up to 3 gigawatts. The second factory is on schedule for completion midway through next year, now that the exterior walls and roof have been completed. “With Phase I already producing U.S.-made PV modules and Phase II moving forward as planned, we are building not just factories, but long-term opportunities for the local community, our employees, and the clean energy future of the United States,” said Marco Marquez, who serves as General Manager of Boviet Solar’s Greenville factory. Although the US solar industry is clearly facing headwinds today, Boviet is among the stakeholders anticipating that the setbacks are temporary. The company has dropped a strong hint that its North Carolina solar factory operations are just for starters. “The Greenville manufacturing hub is central to Boviet Solar’s U.S. growth strategy,” said Boviet Solar USA President Sienna Cen. The wheels are already in motion. Back in 2022, Boviet entered into an agreement with the US solar developer Vesper Energy, involving the supply of Boviet solar modules for Vesper projects in Ohio and Texas. Totaling 680 megawatts (AC), the Texas and Ohio projects are just part of Vesper’s16-gigawatt solar energy and storage plans. Speaking of Texas, if North Carolina wants to lay claim to the #1 go-to destination for a new solar factory, it will have plenty of competition from Texas.The solar manufacturing firm T1(formerly Freyer Battery) andMission Solarare among those moving forward with plans this year. Then there’s Tennessee, where Agriculture Secretary Brooke L. Rollins recently held a press conference in which she excoriated the use of imported solar panels, by way of announcing that her agency will no longer supportsolar loans for farmers. Not to worry, Brooke. Tennessee will do its part to ensure that farmers in search of clean power will have an ample supply of made-in-the-US solar panels on hand. The state has a secret weapon in hand, in the form of a grid-connected industrial site once intended for a nuclear power plant. The nuclear plan slid into the dustbin of history years ago, and now Tennessee is courting solar tenants, among others. First up is the US firm Highland Materials, which has hatched a plan to set upa $1 billion polysilicon manufacturing facilityat the site.

Wherever a visitor meanders on the campus, it’s evident that the company loves making ice cream. It’s also clear that they’re applying a particular business model in their beliefs that they can make the world a better place. Perched on a hillside with a rolling valley below, the site breathes802 fun. The One World logo is visible on the side of the factory as visitors arrive. The parking lot has half a dozenEV chargers. An ice creamflavor graveyardis quite clever, with its rhymes and reasons why flavors are no longer with us. Cow art hangs from interior ceilings. A “yardstick” to measure height is calculated with pints. In a Welcome video to the factory tour, we learn that Ben and Jerry’s gives away ice cream all day once a year. Ben and Jerry’s missionis to imparta progressive, nonpartisan social mission: they do what they can to meet human needs and eliminate injustices in local, national, and international communities. They work to integrate these concerns into their day-to-day business activities. One of their areas of focus is an acknowledgement that the manufacturing of products, by definition, creates waste. Solid waste contributes directly to greenhouse gas emissions through the generation of methane from the anaerobic decay of waste in landfills and the emission of nitrous oxide from solid waste combustion facilities. The Ben and Jerry’s team knew that ice cream manufacturing creates dairy waste too intense to send to the local wastewater treatment facility. It is illegal in the state of Vermontto disposeof organic material like food waste, kitchen scraps, into a trash bin that will go to the landfill. Everybody is legally required to send their food waste to some sort of processing strategy. What could they do todivert food wastefrom landfills and convert it into electricity to helpreduce climate change? The Ben and Jerry’s ice cream plant in St. Albans, VT can churn out over 100 million pints of ice cream a year. When it’s time to switch flavors, it takes an intensive cleaning of the pipes that push the residue into waste. Then there’s the question of what to do once the waste is collected. Food waste in landfills produces methane — a potent greenhouse gas — that can escape to the atmosphere and contributes to climate change. William Branghamreportedfor PBS how Ben and Jerry’s chose an alternative process that works a lot like our own bodies do when we eat: anaerobic digestion. The digestion process produces methane and carbon dioxide, which, if allowed to just leave the reactor would contribute to climate change, but, when it is captured and used, it’s called biogas. Think about it: how do our bodies digest the food we eat? Our guts process what we consume, right? And you’ve probably heard of the humanmicrobiome— all the bacteria, viruses, fungi, archaea, and eukaryotes that inhabit the human body. So at Ben and Jerry’s they have created, in essence, a large constructed gut. It converts high-strength organic waste and out-of-spec food products into renewable energy and clean water. PurposeEnergy and Ben and Jerry’s signed a long-term feedstock agreement in 2021, laying the groundwork for the St. Albans facility. Ben and Jerry’s sends production waste streams through a dedicated pipeline directly to the facility. PurposeEnergy CEO Eric Fitch goes on toexplainhow the wastewater goes into big tanks with bioreactors. “Inside the bioreactors, there are bacteria that just metabolize whatever we’re feeding it,” he says. It’s one of over 2,000 nationwide and receives up to 50,000 gallons a day of waste. Eric Roy, an ecological engineer at the University of Vermont, says the anaerobic digester is full of microbial life, “and that microbial life is digesting the material and turning it into methane gas, which we can then capture and use as an energy source.” Construction for the regional anaerobic digesters commenced in May 2023, and the facility began exporting electricity to the Vermont grid in December 2024. Their manufacturing plants commit to measuring and reducing their environmental impacts in four performance areas: water, solid waste, energy, and CO2 emissions. The waste goes into a methane digester, along with other farm waste, and it generates renewable energy. A big engine turns a big generator that produces electricity, goes through a transformer, and out to the grid. This system puts out a little over a megawatt, which is about enough to power 1,300 homes in Vermont. Leftover particulate matter is removed from the water. The water then goes to the local community’s water treatment plant. They remove over 99% of all the particles and contaminants in it. The digester also produces phosphorus-rich solids — a natural soil amendment. All of that phosphorus that comes into the plant from the concentratedfood waste, and they coagulate it with an iron salt. The result is iron phosphate. Employees can take it home and put it in our their gardens, as it is a useful product now for agriculture. Roy describes how the goal is to try to produce useful fertilizers and also inform best practices for how to use it, “because if nutrients aren’t used properly, they can run off to the water and cause environmental problems.” Vermont’s Lake Champlain gets algae blooms a lot in the summer, and that’s due to phosphorus loading in waterways. Dairy inherently has phosphorus in it. And so they want to make sure that the phosphorus is not getting into the watershed. “This project strengthens Ben and Jerry’s commitment to environmental sustainability by providing a long-term solution for organic waste,” said Ben and Jerry’s Global Sustainability Manager Jenna Evans. “It will reduce Vermont’s road traffic, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and decrease Phosphorous pollution.” By piping waste to the digester, Ben and Jerry’s reduces its carbon footprint. Instead of sending over 600 trucks a year out on the highways across New England to dispose of this waste, they’re eliminating hundreds of trips there and back. “This facility represents a major step forward in sustainable infrastructure for food manufacturing in Vermont,” said Erik Lallum, chief development officer of PurposeEnergy. “It’s a model of industrial symbiosis — turning food production waste into clean energy, reducing emissions, and supporting local economies.” Carolyn Fortuna, PhD, is a writer, researcher, and educator with a lifelong dedication to ecojustice.

Thorcon International, a Singapore-based developer of molten salt reactors, has received permission from Indonesia’s regulator to evaluate a site for a demonstration plant on Kelasa Island. For a country of more than 270 million people with electricity demand that is still growing rapidly, this might appear to be a turning point. Yet if one examines history, technology, and the context in which this project is being launched, the chances of it succeeding look vanishingly small. Indonesia is the world’s largest archipelago, stretching across more than 17,000 islands, with only about 6,000 of them inhabited. This geography creates enormous challenges for the national grid, which is fragmented into multiple regional systems rather than a single interconnected backbone. Java and Sumatra host most of the country’s transmission infrastructure, while many outlying islands depend on small isolated grids. Remote communities often rely on diesel generators for electricity, which are expensive to operate and create significant local pollution. Economically, Indonesia is driven by resource extraction and exports such as coal, palm oil, nickel, and natural gas, as well as a growing manufacturing sector and services economy. Tourism, fisheries, and agriculture remain important contributors, particularly on islands outside the main industrial hubs. This combination of dispersed population, reliance on fossil fuels, and economic dependence on resource sectors shapes both the urgency and the difficulty of Indonesia’s energy transition. Indonesia still relies heavily on coal, which provides about 61% of its electricity, with natural gas and oil supplying most of the rest. Renewables remain modest, with hydropower contributing around 7%, geothermal about 5%, and solar just 1%. The state electricity plan sets out 71 GW of new capacity by 2034, with about 17 GW from solar, 16 GW from hydro, and 5 GW from geothermal. Alongside this, the government has announced a target of 10 GW of nuclear capacity by 2040, marking its first commitment to nuclear power. If delivered, these additions would lift renewables to roughly 35% of the national mix while also introducing nuclear into the system for the first time. Looking further ahead, Indonesia targets 75 GW of new renewable capacity by 2035, supported by more than 10 GW of storage, reflecting the scale of investment needed to diversify away from coal and meet climate commitments. Nuclear power has only succeeded when certain conditions were in place. In the mid-twentieth century, large economies aligned nuclear energy programs with nuclear weapons programs. They standardized on one design, built dozens of gigawatt-scale plants in sequence, trained workforces through government-led programs, and maintained focus for decades. Those programs were not efficient by today’s standards, but they were coherent and well-resourced. Countries that did not follow that formula, such as Canada’s stop-start approach with CANDUs or the the last couple of decades of western nuclear reactor builds, ended up with mixed results and rising costs. Even China, which has mastered megaproject delivery, isstruggling with nuclearbecause it has spread effort across too many designs and has not locked into the necessary standardization. While nuclear advocates in the west point to China’s build out as impressive, it isyears behind on targetsand falling further behind. It only achieved its 2020 target in 2024, is still well under its 2% of grid capacity target for 2025 and its scheduled construction through 2030 will leave it tens of GW off that target. Indonesia has none of the ingredients that historically led to nuclear success. It has no prior nuclear fleet, no experience operating reactors, no large-scale nuclear workforce, no plans to build nuclear weapons and no tradition of standardized reactor builds. It’s not building dozens of standard and proven GW-scale reactors, but only 10 GW in total, starting with a 500 MW unproven design, and not necessarily repeating that one solution multiple times. So far they appear to have little political opposition to nuclear, but that doesn’t mean the bipartisan support required for a two to four decade strategic national construction program. The country is signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has eliminated highly enriched uranium that might be transferable to nuclear weapons from the countyr, so there is military strategic alignment and discipline to call upon. The choice of a molten salt reactor adds another layer of difficulty. Molten salt designs were first tested at Oak Ridge in the 1960s. They worked in the lab but ran into issues with corrosion, material embrittlement, plugging of salt lines, and complex chemistry that had to be actively managed. They never scaled beyond a few megawatts of thermal output. In recent years, startups from North America to Scandinavia have revived the concept, promising walk-away safety and lower costs. Yet not a single one has delivered a commercial plant. Thorcon itself has never built or operated a reactor, anywhere. It is proposing to build large sealed modules in shipyards and tow them to Indonesia, an approach that exists only on paper. Thorcon’s name hints that the red flag of thorium might be in the mix. Thorium has long been held out as an alternative path for nuclear energy. Thorium-232, when exposed to neutrons inside a reactor, transmutes into uranium-233, which is fissile and can sustain a chain reaction. Advocates have argued that thorium is three to four times more abundant than uranium, produces less long-lived waste, and creates inherent barriers to proliferation because the uranium-233 it breeds is contaminated with hard gamma-emitting uranium-232. Experiments dating back to the 1960s, including the Oak Ridge molten salt reactor experiment in the United States and the Shippingport breeder reactor’s final thorium core, proved that the fuel cycle was technically viable. Germany tried thorium in its pebble-bed reactor, and India built an entire nuclear strategy around its domestic thorium reserves, planning a three-stage cycle that would eventually rely on advanced heavy water reactors fueled with uranium-233 bred from thorium. Yet in every case, thorium stopped short of commercial deployment. The complexity of fuel handling, the need for an initial fissile inventory of uranium or plutonium, and the sheer momentum of the uranium-fueled reactor fleet kept thorium in the category of “promising but not delivered.” Thorcon’s original vision was built on thorium’s promise. Its very name, short for “Thorium Concept,” signaled an intention to commercialize molten salt reactors running on a thorium cycle. Early designs envisioned dissolving thorium in molten fluoride salt, breeding uranium-233 in situ, and demonstrating the fuel’s long-touted advantages. But as the company moved from concept to trying to build an actual plant in Indonesia, pragmatism set in. For a first-of-a-kind power reactor, relying on thorium would mean untested chemistry, uncertain licensing pathways, and even greater risk. Indonesia’s proposed demonstration plant is therefore designed to run on conventional low-enriched uranium fuel dissolved in molten salt, not thorium. Thorium remains a potential long-term option in the design, but the Indonesian reactor will take the easier, more familiar path to get the project off the ground. In other words, while Thorcon began as a bet on thorium, its first potential real-world deployment has been scaled back to uranium, underscoring how thorium continues to hover at the edge of nuclear power rather than forming its core. Bent Flyvbjerg’s work on megaprojects should be a warning. He has shown repeatedly that nine out of ten large projects go over budget and over schedule, and nuclear projects are consistently among the very worst. The average nuclear build is more than 100% over budget and about a decade late. Add in the fact that this is a first-of-a-kind reactor by a company with no track record, in a country with no nuclear infrastructure, and the probability of delivering on time, on budget, and at promised cost of electricity falls close to zero. Even if the project is eventually completed, it will almost certainly take much longer and cost much more than advertised, and the benefits to Indonesia will not match the rhetoric. The alternative paths are clearer and less risky. Indonesia sits on some of the world’s richest geothermal resources and has significant hydro potential. Solar costs continue to fall and the archipelago has ample land and rooftops for deployment. With investment in storage, interconnections, and grid modernization, these resources could supply reliable and cheap electricity without the risks of nuclear. International partnerships like the Just Energy Transition Partnership are already funneling billions into renewables and grid upgrades. Building out this system is not trivial, but it does not carry the weight of unproven technologies, uncertain regulation, and the specter of megaproject failure that Thorcon does. Indonesia’s decision to approve Thorcon’s site evaluation is a political signal as much as a technical step. It reflects a desire to appear forward-looking and diversified in energy options. But unless the project is radically different from every other attempt to build nuclear in similar circumstances, it will become another cautionary tale. Years will be lost, billions may be sunk, and coal may remain in the system longer because resources are tied up in a nuclear dream. A better bet would be to double down on renewables, expand storage, and build the transmission backbone to connect islands and balance supply. That path has its own challenges but rests on proven technologies already delivering results worldwide. Indonesia has made a bold gesture toward nuclear.

This remarkable transition showcases how developing nations can successfully balance rapid economic growth with sustainable energy development. The numbers tell a story of unprecedented expansion. India’s renewable energy capacity has reached 203.18 GW as of October 2024, representing 46.3% of the country’s total installed capacity of 452.69 GW. This achievement positions India ahead of many developed nations in renewable energy deployment and demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale clean energy transitions in emerging economies. The solar sector has been the crown jewel of this transformation. From a modest 9.01 GW in March 2016, India’s solar capacity skyrocketed to 97.86 GW by January 2025 — an extraordinary 10-fold increase in just nine years. This growth trajectory has established India as a global solar manufacturing and deployment hub, driving down costs worldwide through economies of scale. While solar expansion captures headlines, India’s renewable strategy extends far beyond photovoltaics. Wind power blows powerfully into the energy mix, with recent peak generation reaching 28,974 MW in January 2025. The government has committed to issuing bids for at least 10 GW of wind capacity annually from 2023-24 to 2027-28, ensuring continued diversification. India ranks fifth globally in hydroelectric power capacity, with both large-scale projects and distributed small hydro installations contributing to the renewable portfolio. The country is also exploring cutting-edge technologies, including a recent partnership between Eco Wave Power and Bharat Petroleum to develop India’s estimated 40,000 MW wave energy potential. The infrastructure development supporting this growth has been equally impressive. India now operates 58 solar parks with a combined sanctioned capacity of 40 GW, creating renewable energy clusters that optimize land use and transmission efficiency. This systematic approach to large-scale deployment has become a model for other developing nations. Recent momentum has accelerated even further. In fiscal year 2025, India added 25 GW of renewable capacity — a 35% increase over the previous year’s 18.57 GW addition. This acceleration demonstrates the maturation of India’s renewable energy ecosystem, from manufacturing and financing to project development and grid integration. There are also projects done by partnerships from foreign investments. One example is the ACEN Masaya Solar Facility. ACEN is part of the Philippine’s Ayala Group’s energy platform, a 420 MWp solar farm located in Madhya Pradesh and since 2024 has been generating a maximum of about 690 GWh of clean energy annually, preventing over 635,000 metric tons of carbon emissions. This project created about 500 jobs, and is a partnership between ACEN and UPC Solar Asia Pacific financed by a 20-year loan from the State Bank of India. The $220 million project is now selling power to the Solar Energy Corporation of India under a long-term agreement. India’s renewable achievements extend beyond domestic benefits to global climate action. The country has reduced its carbon intensity by 7% through FY24 while achieving 50% renewable energy in its grid five years ahead of target. This performance exemplifies how emerging economies can decouple economic growth from carbon emissions. The transformation has positioned India as a credible leader in international climate forums. With current renewable capacity at approximately 209 GW by December 2024, the country is well-positioned to achieve its ambitious 2030 target of 500 GW from non-fossil fuel sources, though significant challenges remain. Beyond environmental benefits, India’s renewable transition has generated substantial economic advantages. The sector has created millions of jobs across manufacturing, installation, and maintenance, while reducing dependence on fossil fuel imports. Wind power’s unique characteristic of generating nearly 60% of its output during nighttime hours complements solar generation patterns, providing pricing advantages comparable to stored solar power. India’s renewable energy journey since 2016 represents one of the most successful large-scale energy transitions in modern history. By combining ambitious policy targets with systematic infrastructure development and technological innovation, India has demonstrated that developing nations can lead global clean energy adoption while maintaining robust economic growth. As the country continues toward its 2030 goals, its experience provides a valuable blueprint for sustainable development worldwide. India has a cumulative solar power capacity of 119.02 GW as of July 2025, with ground-mounted solar plants, grid-connected rooftop systems, hybrid projects, and off-grid installations contributing to this total. The country possesses significant solar potential, receiving abundant solar radiation throughout the year. India aims to become a global leader in solar energy, driven by the National Solar Mission (NSM) launched in 2010 and supported by government initiatives like the PM-KUSUM Scheme and the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana. At the heart of India’s solar revolution are two major government schemes managed by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). The PM-Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, launched in early 2024, aims to equip a remarkable 10 million households with rooftop solar systems. According to press releases from India’s official Press Information Bureau (PIB), this program is expected to add 30 GW of solar capacity to the residential sector, providing households with free or low-cost electricity. A key component of this initiative, which has a total outlay of approximately $96 million, is the development of a “Model Solar Village” in every district, where each selected village receives around $1.2 million in central financial assistance. The PM-KUSUM Scheme is a program specifically targeting the agricultural sector that was extended until March 2026. This scheme, as noted by theEnergyMonitor.aipublication in April 2025, aims to improve farmers’ income and reduce their dependence on diesel pumps by providing financial support for the installation of 10,000 MW of decentralized solar power plants, 1.5 million standalone solar-powered agriculture pumps, and the solarization of 3.5 million grid-connected pumps. Beyond residential and agricultural use, India’s strategy also includes fostering a robust solar ecosystem through large-scale projects and domestic manufacturing. The Solar Parks Scheme, facilitated by the MNRE, promotes massive grid-connected solar power projects by providing essential infrastructure like land, power evacuation facilities, and road access. According to recent PIB and MNRE reports, as of March 31, 2025, 55 solar parks with a combined capacity of nearly 40 GW have been approved across 13 states, with over 12.8 GW already commissioned in 24 parks. To reduce import dependency, the Indian government also launched the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for High-Efficiency Solar PV Modules, a program with a budget of approximately $2.88 billion. This scheme, as reported byEnergyMonitor.ai, aims to boost domestic manufacturing, and Letters of Award have already been issued for setting up 48.3 GW of new manufacturing capacity. India’s push for solar is reflected in some of the world’s most ambitious projects. Blackridge Research highlighted several of these in its April 2025 report on upcoming renewable energy projects. One such project is the monumental Khavda Renewable Energy Park in the Kutch district of Gujarat. This 30 GW solar and wind hybrid project is set to become the world’s largest renewable energy park, with 2 GW of capacity already operational as of early 2025. In the high-altitude region of Ladakh, another landmark project is underway: a 13 GW solar power plant with a battery energy storage system (BESS). Expected to be completed by 2030, this initiative includes extensive transmission infrastructure to meet the energy needs of the Union Territory.

That is true, but it is also part of a larger story about the heavy materials industries. Every time a cubic meter of cross laminated timber (CLT) replaces concrete, the demand for cement and the demand for rebar decline. Over decades, those substitutions add up. What looks like a small shift in construction methods at the project level becomes a driver of global demand curves for both cement and steel. By bending those curves downward, CLT helps make decarbonization in the heaviest industries more realistic. The first three articles in this series established the foundation. Theopening pieceshowed that CLT and modular construction are Canada’s fastest lever to address the housing shortage and embodied emissions at the same time. Thesecond articleexplored Mark Carney’s Build Canada Homes initiative and argued that government must act as an anchor customer for CLT factories, turning policy into real square footage. Thethird articlelaid out the mass timber playbook, describing the need to integrate sawmills, bioenergy, adhesives, and logistics into a coherent value chain. This article builds on that foundation by looking outward, asking how CLT shapes the long term trajectories of cement and steel demand. For years, projections of cement and steel demand have assumed almost linear growth in line with GDP and urbanization. These models often point to mid-century peaks and flat demand well into the back half of the century. My assessment is different. The Chinese infrastructure and building boom that drove global demand in the last two decades has peaked. Advanced economies are shifting from expansion to maintenance. Efficiency gains are real and accelerating. Substitution pressures from timber, lightweight composites, and smarter design are starting to bite. Taken together, the result is that global demand for both cement and steel will peak earlier, flatten more quickly, and then decline gradually for the rest of the century. Cement is the clearest example. In mid-rise residential and parts of the commercial sector, CLT is already displacing concrete slabs and cores. Codes are evolving to allow taller timber structures and procurement policies are starting to recognize embodied carbon. Supplementary cementitious materials are being blended into mixes around the world, reducing the clinker ratio in every cubic meter of concrete. In myprojection curves, cement demand does not climb steadily to 2100. It peaks in the 2020s, flattens in the 2030s, and then declines to about a third of today’s levels by the end of the century. The drivers are substitution by mass timber where it makes sense, efficiency in design that uses less material, and caps on embodied carbon that reward lower carbon alternatives. The cuts bite hardest in residential and office buildings, where modular CLT is becoming a mainstream option. Infrastructure like highways and dams will continue to need cement, but the aggregate volumes will not offset the reductions in the building sector. In itslong-term forecast, the World Cement Association agrees that global cement demand, particularly for clinker, will peak well before mid-century and then decline significantly. The white paper suggests that demand could fall from around 4.2 billion tons in 2020 to approximately 3.0 billion tons by 2050. By mid-century, cement demand may sit at just half of today’s level, driven by slower growth in China, expanded use of substitutes and design efficiencies, and the rise of low-carbon alternatives. That outlook aligns closely with my modeling. Where most forecasts expect continual growth, WCA sees a future reshaped by material substitution and efficiency, exactly what mass timber brings to the table. As a side note, this is one of the few cases where my projections of demand decline in major industries is publicly agreed on by the industry itself. There are economic reasons for a public projection of growth even if the industry knows it’s facing decline or at minimum much slower growth. Look at oil and gas, maritime shipping, and aviation for prime examples, as well as the absurd projections of hydrogen demand growth. Steel is tied closely to cement because so much steel goes into rebar and structural frameworks for concrete buildings. As concrete declines, so does the need for rebar. Myprojectionsshow global steel demand bending downward in parallel with cement. This does not mean steel vanishes. Infrastructure, vehicles, and machinery will continue to require it, but the rebar segment will shrink steadily. The opportunity that comes with this shift is significant. A flatter and declining steel demand curve makes it possible for electric arc furnaces powered by clean electricity to dominate global production. That transition depends on scrap flows being sufficient to cover a larger share of demand. With lower total demand, the scrap available is enough to feed more of the system. In effect, the substitution of CLT for concrete not only cuts emissions directly but also makes the steel industry’s decarbonization problem easier by reducing volumes and aligning with scrap based pathways. The guiding policy that emerges from this analysis is clear. We should prioritize timber in buildings where it performs as well or better than concrete and steel, and codes and financing should favor low embodied carbon materials. Procurement should credit the biogenic storage in timber, recognizing the carbon locked away in panels for decades. Embodied carbon caps in building codes can nudge developers and designers toward materials that score better on life cycle analysis. These are not radical steps. They are practical tools that reward better choices and accelerate substitution. The actions are equally concrete. Timber should become the default for multi-unit residential buildings and mid-rise offices. Hybrid designs should replace podiums, stairwells, and cores with timber where engineering supports it. Cement mixes should be pushed toward maximum supplementary content, cutting clinker volumes wherever possible. Steel producers should double down on electric arc furnace pathways, aligning recycling infrastructure and scrap collection with projected demand. Taken together, these steps lock in the displacement of cement and steel in the building sector and make the heavy industry decarbonization challenge manageable. Risks remain. If codes evolve too slowly, substitution will lag. If insurance markets resist, adoption will be slower. Incumbent industries will continue to defend their markets. Lumber supply volatility and land management controversies can undermine the case for mass timber if not handled responsibly. At the same time, the enablers are strong. CLT costs are coming down with scale. Government procurement can lead by example. Investors are focusing on embodied carbon as part of ESG mandates. Export markets, particularly in the United States and Europe, are opening quickly to mass timber solutions. The conclusion is that CLT is one of the sharpest knives we have to cut into global cement and steel demand, reducing the challenges of dealing with emissions from those hard-to-abate sectors. It is not the only lever, but it is a powerful one that compounds over decades. By displacing concrete and the rebar inside it, CLT bends both curves downward, turning what looked like an impossible decarbonization climb for heavy industry into a slope that can be managed. My projections for cement and steel through 2100 reflect this reality. Cement peaks soon, declines steadily, and ends the century at about a third of today’s levels. Steel flattens, declines, and transitions to an electric arc furnace dominant industry powered by clean electricity and abundant scrap. These curves are not just numbers. They are pathways to aligning housing, economy, and climate in a way that makes the future less daunting and more achievable. is a climate futurist, strategist and author.

His new book,Here Comes The Sun, pays homage to the George Harrison song of the same name. OnMcKibben’s website, you will find this description: “Here Comes the Suntells the story of the sudden spike in power from the sun and wind—and the desperate fight of the fossil fuel industry and their politicians to hold this new power at bay. From the everyday citizens who installed solar panels equal to a third of Pakistan’s electric grid in a year to the world’s sixth-largest economy — California — nearly halving its use of natural gas in the last two years,Bill McKibbentraces the arrival of plentiful, inexpensive solar energy. And he shows how solar power is more than just a path out of the climate crisis: it is a chance to reorder the world on saner and more humane grounds. You can’t hoard solar energy or hold it in reserves—it’s available to all.” We have been having quite adiscussion about solarlately here at the funhouse we callCleanTechnica, fueled by lots of thoughtful and insightful comments from readers. Yesterday we discussed the surge in personal solar installations in Pakistan and what it may portend for the traditional utility model in which the company owns the electricity and only shares it with others if they can pay for it. Solar has the potential to upend that model or skip right over it in some cases. Today, a report byEmber Energysays much the same thing that is happening in Pakistan is happening in Africa as well. It says Africa’s solar panel imports set a new record in the 12 months from June 2024 to June 2025. In that 12-month period, 15,032 MW of solar panels were imported to Africa — a 60% increase over the 9,379 MW imported in the preceding 12-month period. Much of the increase in the last 12 months took place in countries other than South Africa. In the rest of the continent, imports of solar panels tripled from 3,734 MW between June 2023 and June 2024 to 11,248 MW in the 12 months from June 2024 to June 2025. “The increase in imports is more than a single month spike,” Ember says. “Monthly imports jumped to a record in December 2024, but have consistently elevated since. While the December surge initially raised questions — potentially driven by Chinese manufacturers meeting year-end sales targets — the data now indicates this is part of a broader, structural trend.” The surge did not occur only in one country. Algeria rose 33-fold in the 12 months to June 2025, compared to the previous 12 months. Zambia rose eight-fold, Botswana seven-fold, Sudan six-fold, and Liberia, DRC, Benin, Angola, and Ethiopia all more than tripled. China exports a lot of solar panels, but at the same time, it is installing more domestically than any other nation. In the first six months of 2025 alone, China installed new solar systems with a total capacity of 210 GW, according toRenewable Energy Industry News. That makes it the first nation to reach that level. China’s economic and industrial policy consistently focuses on renewable energy, battery storage, and electric transportation. The Chinese government wants to reduce the high import risks and geopolitical dependencies associated with fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal in order to operate on global markets from a position of industrial strength. CleanTechnicareaders are all above average and so they know that China also has the dubious distinction of building more coal-fired generating stations than any other nation. How does that square with its clean energy intentions? A partial answer is that coal is a tactical strategy to keep the economy humming until the strategic goal of renewable energy can catch up. Is that cynical? Perhaps, but it may also be seen as practical. The way China operates, all those coal-powered facilities don’t have to continue in operation for the entirety of their useful life. If they get shuttered prematurely because they are no longer needed, that will happen. China has a plan to be 100% renewable by 2060. That is ten years later than other countries. The difference is, China can be expected to actually meet its target, while those other nations will still be doling out truckloads of good intentions in 2060 with no real progress made between now and then. According toChina Daily, the expansion of renewable energy will continue in the coming years. Based on the country’s 15th Five-Year Plan (2026–2030), the CEC expects an annual increase of 200 to 300 GW in renewable energy capacity. In total, China’s installed power capacity is expected to rise to around 3.9 TW by the end of 2025 — up 16.5% compared to the previous year. At the same time, it expects electricity consumption in 2025 to increase by about 6%. By the end of 2025, total solar capacity in China is expected to reach 1,300 GW. “The solar power produced in China in 2025 alone will already account for about half of the annual electricity generation of all nuclear power plants operating worldwide,” said Dr. Norbert Allnoch of Internationales Wirtschaftsforum Regenerative Energien (IWR). By the end of the decade, the IWR expects solar capacity in China to reach as much as 2,500 GW — more than the total of all global nuclear power production. “But that’s merely a side effect,” Allnoch emphasized. He said China aims to further expand its leading position in the future sectors of renewable energy technology, storage technology, and electric transportation, while gradually reducing its dependency on fossil fuels. If only other nations would sign on to that sort of policy goal. All this good news about solar energy meshes well with what Bill McKibben has to say in a recent interview withNewsweek, which asked why more people are not aware of the rise in solar power. He said, “I think it’s because we’ve spent so long calling this stuff alternative energy that it got stuck in a corner of our brain and became difficult for people to imagine. You read endless stories about all the different kinds of possible alternatives, small nuclear reactors and tidal power and geothermal, all of which are interesting, but none of which are scaling in any significant way. “Meanwhile, this is so obviously the economic way forward that it’s, almost without people paying attention, has just snuck up on everyone. It happened very fast—that’s the other thing. You know, it’s only maybe five years ago that we crossed some invisible line where this stuff became cheaper than burning coal and gas and oil. So, this is a different world than the one we’ve lived in.” He talked about how people for a long time have been trying to find ways to make fossil fuels more expensive — after all, they pay nothing for the waste products they produce. “Now we’re in this upside-down world where renewable energy is cheap and fossil energy is comparatively expensive. And I think the first people to really figure out the true dynamics of this world were in the oil industry, who understood it for the threat that it was.” What gladdens the heart of this Vermont-based environmental campaigner is that California is burning 40% less methane to generate electricity that it did just 2 years ago, thanks in large measure to the abundance of solar energy produced within its borders. “You’ve got to figure that for the oil industry, that’s a scary number. That really indicates the kind of pressure that they’re starting to feel. “And I think that that explains more than anything else their unprecedented involvement in our political life. And so, to me, that’s sort of the ultimate back-handed compliment to the renewable energy boom — the fact that big oil is clearly freaked out and doing everything they can to slow it down.” The cracks are beginning to appear in the fossil fuel business model. AsMichael Barnardreported earlier this month, “Wall Street’s six largest banks have cut their financing to oil, gas and coal projects by 25 percent year-on-year through August 1, 2025. In dollar terms, that means about $73 billion this year versus roughly $97 billion in the same period in 2024.” Take all this news and tie it up and what have you got? A glimpse of the future that includes a lot less fossil fuels, despite the efforts of the current administration to drag the US back to the 19th century. Somewhere, Adam Smith is smiling, as his economic theory is being proven to work exactly as he said it would — cheaperer is betterer. The age of fossil fuels is not already over mostly because of the enormous political influence the industry has bought with itsbribescampaign contributions. But in the end, none of that will matter.

Progress has been inching along at a pace that would put a snail to shame, but it is progress nevertheless, and the new documentary could help foster a renewed burst of public support for habitat conservation efforts around the world. The white rhino rescue team works under the umbrella of the Germany-basedBioRescueproject, and they have their work cut out for them. Only two northern white rhinos are left on Earth, which makes the rescue effort difficult enough. To make the task of teasing out another generation all but impossible, both are females. Nevertheless, the advanced state of 21st century reproductive science is the key that keeps the possible alive. To get an up-close look at that, check out the new National Geographic documentaryThe Last Rhinos: A New Hope, now streaming onDisney+ and Hulu. During an online press conference last week, BioRescue Director Jan Stejskal discussed the impact of his team’s work on the potential for rescuing other species. However, he also emphasized that the delicate, painstaking labwork behind the northern white rhino project is a rescue mission of last resort, made necessary by failed attempts at habitat conservation and species preservation. “It’s true that habitat conservation gets precedence, but in some cases all of these steps were already tried and they didn’t work,” Stejskal toldCleanTechnica. “A new approach was needed for the northern white rhino.” In addition to suffering from the impacts of habitat encroachment in Central and East Africa, northern white rhinos were murdered by poachers and caught in the crossfire of wars. The two remaining females,Fatu and Najin, are living out their lives at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. The lessons of the northern white rhino for other nations around the world are clear, particularly here in the US where habitat conservation has taken a back seat to other concerns of the current administration. Nevertheless, some pockets of continued progress on habitat conservation still exist. One good example is the emerging field of agrivoltaics, in which rural solar arrays are designed to accommodate pollinator habitats, native species restoration, or livestock grazing (or all three) as well as food crops for human consumption. Agrivoltaic arrays can function as a farmland conservation tools, habitat conservation tools, or both. Farmers who lease their land to an agrivoltaic developer can earn a reliable income stream to provide financial support, helping to avoid bankruptcy and enabling the land to remain viable for agricultural operations. Although solar critics oppose the use of farmland for solar arrays, ground-mounted solar panels have a light footprint. They can be removed at the end of their lifespan and the entire site can be returned to agriculture. In fact, solar arrays cover a vanishingly small percentage of farmland in the US. Historically and up to this day, the overwhelming cause ofpermanent farmland lossin the US is real estate development, withlow-density housingemerging as a main cause alongside tract homes, warehouses, malls, and other buildings. Farmland also intersects with habitat conservation in the field of regenerative agriculture. In contrast to the soil-impacting, chemically dependent monocrop strategies that underpin conventional industrial-scale agriculture, regenerative strategies reflect indigenous practices that focus on soil health, biodiversity, and water conservation. The leading farmland conservation organization American Farmland Trust supports regenerative farming, both as as complement to agrivoltaics and as a standalone practice.”Well-managed farmland supports wildlife and biodiversity, cleans our water, increases resilience to natural disasters like floods and fires, and helps combat climate change,” AFT explains. “In all senses of the word, farmland sustains us. Yet we are losing it at an alarming rate. And on land that continues to be farmed, we are also losing ground—quite literally. We have lost billions of tons of topsoil.” the organization emphasizes. Among other activities, AFT offers a regenerative farming microgrant program. One showcase for the program is a livestock farm in New England, where an AFT grant supported the replacement of a sprawling thicket ofinvasive and non-native specieswith pollinator-friendly native species. AFT is just one among hundreds of non-profit land trusts in the US, organized under the umbrella of theLand Trust Alliance. “Most land trust projects start through the generosity of private landowners, and many of these lands are open to the public,” LTA explains. “In fact, 80 percent of land trusts provide public access to their protected lands, according to the 2020 National Land Trust Census, amounting to 1.2 million acres of land and 9,761 miles of trails open to the public,” LTA adds. Along with hiking and biking opportunities, open-access land trusts can provide communities with a long list of quality-of-life services including guided nature walks and classes as well as farmers markets and community gardens, among many other activities. “Land trusts do not do this work alone. They partner with libraries, gyms, community centers, farmers co-ops, local businesses, extension agents, schools, hospitals and other nonprofits to connect people with the land in ways that are meaningful to them,” LTA emphasizes. In some cases, land trusts also work with local, state, and federal agencies to transfer private land to public ownership. Some examples cited by LTA include the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy (transferred 105 acres of forest to the Pennsylvania Game Commission); Black Swamp Conservancy in Ohio (gifted a mix of farm, forest, and wetland along the Sandusky River to the Sandusky County Park District); The Bitter Root Land Trust in Montana (transferred 70 acres of river bottom to the City of Hamilton); and The Trust for Public Land (transferred 15 square miles in New Mexico to the federal Sabinoso Wilderness Area). “The project represents the largest land donation to a federal wilderness area in U.S. history and will help increase public access to this remote area,” LTA notes, referring to the Sabinoso transfer. These local habitat conservation efforts are more valuable now than ever before.

After more than a century of oil rigs humming across red-dirt fields—from Muskogee to the Panhandle—towns like Tulsa, Bartlesville and Stillwater are setting their sights on a fresh frontier: naturally occurringwhite hydrogen. It’s the latest chapter inOklahoma energy research, where the pumpjack’s steady beat is making room for the promise ofnatural hydrogen.With nearly four million residents and over 500,000 legacy wells threading beneath our feet, Oklahoma already has a head start. On August 25, 2025, OSU’sCollege of Engineering, Architecture and Technology (CEAT)kicked off a year-long, grant-funded initiative backed by theOSU Hamm Institute for American Energy. Their mission? Map, quantify and evaluate white hydrogen’s long-term viability—building a data-driven foundation for future extraction, production and deployment.Mapping the Invisible: Characterizing Natural HydrogenLeading the charge isDr. Prem Bikkina, whose knack for subsurface resource evaluation is well known. He’s joined by geoscience prosDr. Priyank JaiswalandDr. Javier Vilcaez Perez, and together they’re piecing together:– Historical seismic lines from the Anadarko and Arkoma basins– Core samples pulled from wells drilled as far back as the 1920s– Advanced isotope ratio mass spectrometry to sniff out hydrogen anomalies– Magnetotelluric surveys and remote sensing to sharpen structural modelsBy training machine-learning algorithms on global analogs, they’ve already bumped prediction accuracy by roughly 70%. Their target: deliver high-resolution maps by month six, pinpointing a dozen “sweet spots” where pressure, purity and reservoir connectivity all line up. Those maps will guide pilot drills and sustainable well designs.Innovative Extraction: A Game-Changer Under ExplorationGreen hydrogen usually starts in a water electrolyzer, but white hydrogen bubbles up naturally from deep rock formations—no giant electrolyzer required. Early assays show in-situ purity levels north of 95%, which could be a real cost-saver. Here’s how the CEAT team plans to tap into it:– High-precision downhole sensors to monitor hydrogen pressure shifts– Proton exchange membranes in modular separation units to purify soft streams– Compact compression systems built for handling lightweight gas safelyThe goal is maximum recovery with minimal surface disturbance and water use. Of course, these methods haven’t been tested at scale yet, and debates continue about how quickly natural hydrogen reservoirs refill. To keep things sustainable, extensive pressure monitoring and conservative drawdown tests are baked into the plan—ensuring solidhydrogen sustainability.Challenges and Next StepsNo trailblazing effort sails completely smooth. Key hurdles include:– Evolving regulations: Hydrogen well standards are still in flux– Environmental safeguards: Rigorous impact studies and community buy-in are must-haves– Cost curves: Membrane and compression gear need to get cheaper before hydrogen can compete with natural gasTo tackle these, CEAT is forming a policy advisory panel with the Oklahoma Energy Office, theU.S. Department of Energyand local conservation groups. They’ll host roundtables with landowners and tribal nations to build trust. Come the final quarter of the grant year, two proof-of-concept sites will fire up—delivering real-world data on flow rates, price tags and environmental footprints. By mid-2026, a full feasibility report should point the way to multi-million-dollar follow-on funding and private-sector partnerships.A Glimpse into the Future: Sustainability and LeadershipPicture this:• Power Generation: Swapping out half of Oklahoma’s gas-fired turbines for hydrogen ones, cutting CO₂ by up to 45%.• Transportation: Fuel-cell buses and big rigs slashing urban smog by 70–80%, boosting public health.• Grid Storage: Gigawatt-hours of hydrogen reserves smoothing out wind and solar peaks.• Industry: Chemical and steel plants switching to hydrogen, chopping Scope 1 emissions and trimming costs.By locking arms with theDepartment of Energy’sHydrogen Hub initiative, Oklahoma could become a regional anchor—pipelines, refueling stations, manufacturing centers and all. It’s a blend of economic diversification and genuine climate resilience.Empowering Tomorrow: Training, Collaboration and Economic ImpactThis white hydrogen adventure isn’t just about geology and engineering; it’s about people. Over the next year, CEAT—partnering with theBoone Pickens School of Geology—will:– Engage 30+ graduate students in reservoir modeling, geochemistry labs and policy analysis– Offer 20 undergraduates internships in field sampling, data management and environmental monitoring– Host workshops uniting energy companies, regulators, tribal leaders and conservation groups“Building local expertise is what makes this real,” saysDr. Javier Vilcaez Perez. “We’re not just discovering hydrogen; we’re cultivating the workforce to roll it out responsibly.” Expect new service companies—designing wells, crafting sensors, auditing environments—to pop up, potentially creating hundreds of sustainable jobs across all 77 counties.A Regional Network with Global PotentialOSU’s white hydrogen initiative is the first of its kind in the U.S., but it’s part of a worldwide wave.

I’ve been fortunate enough to have been a writer for Hydrogen News for over 15 years, and I still enjoy every moment of it. The subject matter is something that I’m extremely passionate about, and I believe that passion comes through in my writing. When I was younger, I used to play tennis quite a bit. Nowadays, however, I’ve set my sights on a new sport called pickleball. It’s a bit of a craze at the moment, but I’m absolutely hooked. Whenever I’m not writing articles or doing research, you can often find me on the pickleball court. It’s a great way to stay active, and I always have a blast playing with my friends. I’m always striving to improve my writing and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the industry. I believe that writing is a journey of constant improvement, and I’m excited to see where that journey will take me next. Whether I’m writing about hydrogen news or the latest pickleball trends, I always aim to bring my unique perspective to the table and create content that engages and entertains my readers.

Slated for runs on the East River, thiszero-emission technologyvessel aims to replace diesel boats on key commuter and tourist routes, pushing the city further along itssustainable energyjourney. By tapping operational data from San Francisco’s “Sea Change” ferry, SWITCH Maritime is setting out to prove thathydrogen fuel cellsaren’t just feasible—they can scale up to meet urban demand. This award is one of five projects under NYSERDA’s$11 million Advanced Fuels and Thermal Energy Research Program, a clear signal of New York’s commitment toindustrial decarbonization.Strategic ImpactWe’re truly at a crossroads where decarbonizing public transit has jumped from whiteboard concept to real-world action. ForSWITCH Maritime, this grant is a thumbs-up for its “zero-emissions-as-a-service” model—bundling vessel leasing, on-shorehydrogen infrastructureand crew training into one neat package for ferry operators. City and state agencies are eyeing quieter waterfronts and cleaner air corridors, which have historically ranked among the region’s worst pollution hotspots. Since ferry routes have been pollution hotbeds for years, this shift also promises tangible public health benefits for waterfront communities. With diesel costs still on a rollercoaster, operators could see genuine savings on fuel and maintenance. By shouldering up-front costs,NYSERDAis smoothing the way for wider market adoption and setting a blueprint that other regions can follow. If all goes as planned, SWITCH could leverage this showcase to reel in more orders and partnerships, cementing its reputation as a go-to provider ofhydrogen fuel cellvessels.Policy ContextThis initiative sits squarely under theClimate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which demands steep greenhouse gas cuts across every sector. Through NYSERDA’s Advanced Fuels Program, state funds and leveraged federal resources team up to de-risk early-stage clean energy demonstrations and accelerateindustrial decarbonizationin maritime transport. While permit pathways from California’s hydrogen vessel approvals offered a helpful shortcut, New York still needs to fine-tune local codes to match evolvinghydrogen infrastructureand safety standards.NYC Waterways & Emission ChallengesSince the 19th century, ferries have been the unsung workhorses of New York’s transit network—but for too long they’ve relied on diesel engines that kick up soot, roar like thunder, and puff out nitrogen oxides. Shuttling millions of passengers annually, these vessels are vital commuter arteries, yet they’ve become some of the area’s worst polluters. Switching gears tozero-emission technologyisn’t just about dodging fines—it’s a public health win and a savvy hedge against unpredictable fuel markets. This move also underscores the importance of building robusthydrogen infrastructureto support sustainable waterways.Lessons from San Francisco’s “Sea Change”In July 2024,SWITCH Maritimelaunched theSea Change, the first hydrogen-powered passenger ferry in the U.S., cruising at speeds up to 25 knots. That pilot taught us plenty: from refueling protocols and supply chain tricks to smarter maintenance cycles. Riders noticed snappier acceleration and regulators gave props to a 50% drop in acoustic footprint compared to diesels, helping clip months off New York’s permitting timeline. Today, on-shore storage and distribution plans in NYC are being modeled closely on that San Francisco playbook.Technical SnapshotHere’s the gist: the new ferry will stash compressed hydrogen—up to 700 bar—in onboard tanks, feeding a Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell that generates electricity for quiet, direct-drive motors. With a 150-seat layout and 25-knot top speed, it promises diesel-like performance but only emits water vapor. On land, modular refueling stations and dedicated storage tanks will slot right alongside existing docks, cutting down on civil works. Looking ahead, SWITCH is already sketching a 300-passenger RoPax concept and a liquid hydrogen version with leading European yards.Collateral Benefits & ChallengesSpeeds up broader adoption ofzero-emission technologyin public transit.Chops down air and noise pollution in densely populated waterfront areas.Kicks localhydrogen infrastructuredevelopment into high gear, creating green jobs and bolstering supply chain resilience.Sets benchmarks for retiring aging diesel fleets across U.S. ports.Short-term hurdles include aligning safety regulations, managing capital outlays, and scaling the refueling network.Main InsightsThis grant is one of five under NYSERDA’s $11M Advanced Fuels and Thermal Energy Research Program.A 150-passenger capacity, 25-knot performance, and water-only emissions tick all the boxes for city operators.The “zero-emissions-as-a-service” package trims complexity by bundling vessel, fuel, and training into one solution.San Francisco’sSea Changeproject provided critical data on refueling speed and rider acceptance.Parallel DevelopmentsAcross the pond, Norway’sMF Hydraliquid hydrogen ferry is charting new territory, and SWITCH’s upcoming RoPax project aims to replicate that success on U.S. waters. Countries like Japan and South Korea are also ramping up hydrogen ferry trials, underscoring a global shift toward maritimesustainable energy. Thanks to California’s early adopter status, a lot of regulatory groundwork is already in place—but New York’s busier harbor will be the real test. Private investors and transit agencies nationwide are watching this demo closely to shape their own fleet-renewal strategies.Looking AheadTrials are slated to kick off by mid-2026, with full service rolling out after a successful shake-down period. If the ferry meets its performance and cost targets, New York could certify dozens more vessels, reshaping maritime mobility and cementinghydrogen fuel cellsas a cornerstone of urbansustainable energysolutions.

Now, SWITCH is charting an ambitious growth path in New York and beyond.Spread the love NYC Waterways & Emission ChallengesSince the 19th century, ferries have been the unsung workhorses of New York’s transit network—but for too long they’ve relied on diesel engines that kick up soot, roar like thunder, and puff out nitrogen oxides. Shuttling millions of passengers annually, these vessels are vital commuter arteries, yet they’ve become some of the area’s worst polluters. Switching gears tozero-emission technologyisn’t just about dodging fines—it’s a public health win and a savvy hedge against unpredictable fuel markets. This move also underscores the importance of building robusthydrogen infrastructureto support sustainable waterways.Lessons from San Francisco’s “Sea Change”In July 2024,SWITCH Maritimelaunched theSea Change, the first hydrogen-powered passenger ferry in the U.S., cruising at speeds up to 25 knots. That pilot taught us plenty: from refueling protocols and supply chain tricks to smarter maintenance cycles. Riders noticed snappier acceleration and regulators gave props to a 50% drop in acoustic footprint compared to diesels, helping clip months off New York’s permitting timeline. Today, on-shore storage and distribution plans in NYC are being modeled closely on that San Francisco playbook.Technical SnapshotHere’s the gist: the new ferry will stash compressed hydrogen—up to 700 bar—in onboard tanks, feeding a Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell that generates electricity for quiet, direct-drive motors. With a 150-seat layout and 25-knot top speed, it promises diesel-like performance but only emits water vapor. On land, modular refueling stations and dedicated storage tanks will slot right alongside existing docks, cutting down on civil works.

Well, guess what: the Netherlands Aerospace Centre (NLR) just flipped the script withliquid hydrogen. On August 18, 2025, theirHYDRA-2drone took off in the Netherlands on nothing but a cryogenic liquid hydrogen system. Teaming up withCryoworld, this breakthrough opens doors to longer missions, full-onzero-emission technologyoperations and even hints at manned hydrogen flights on the horizon.Breakthrough Test FlightThe HYDRA-2’s debut unfolded at NLR’s North Holland test site, a hotbed of aerospace know-how. Piloted remotely, the drone climbed without a hitch and settled into a smooth, stable forward cruise—outlasting its battery-electric and compressed-gas cousins. The real star? Cryoworld’s vacuum-jacketed composite tank. It held hydrogen at a frosty –253°C, slashed boil-off losses and kept pressure rock-solid throughout. This wasn’t just a first for the Netherlands; it’s a clarion call for regulators and policymakers to craft standards aroundsustainable energyfuels.Inside the TechnologySo, what’s under the hood? HYDRA-2 packs a lightweight, vacuum-jacketed composite tank built from carbon fiber reinforced polymers with next-gen liners. Multi-layer insulation fends off heat, limiting boil-off to just a few percent per day. Compared to metal vessels, it’s about 30% lighter—freeing up weight for extrahydrogen storageor mission-specific payloads. Thanks to Cryoworld’s engineering chops, the tank checks all the boxes for aviation safety: pressure, impact resistance and thermal cycling.From the tank, liquid hydrogen feeds ahydrogen fuel cellsstack—specifically, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) module that splits H₂ into protons and electrons to generate clean electricity. That power drives an efficient electric motor, with water vapor as the only byproduct. Even the waste heat gets a second life via a thermal management loop, boosting efficiency and cutting back on extra cooling needs. In flight, a web of sensors feeds live data—temperatures, pressures, flow rates—to an onboard computer that tweaks power delivery on the fly. With up to five times the specific energy of batteries, hydrogen fuel cells give HYDRA-2 a serious edge on endurance missions.Evolution of Hydrogen AviationHydrogen in aviation isn’t new, but storage has long been the roadblock. Back in 2019, NLR’s HYDRA-1 demo used compressed hydrogen, and while fuel cells worked, high-pressure tanks limited airtime. Switching to liquid hydrogen cranks up energy density—around 120 MJ/kg versus 5 MJ/kg for top-tier batteries—unlocking missions that were previously science fiction. Adapting cryogenic materials and insulation from space applications to continuous flight conditions wasn’t trivial, but HYDRA-2 bridges the gap between niche R&D and scalable, real-world ops.Worldwide, from big research hubs to nimble startups, everyone’s racing to validate hydrogen propulsion for drones and small aircraft. By running liquid hydrogen in a real-world demo, NLR delivers crucial insights on handling, safety and performance—fueling the collective push toward decarbonized flight.Strategic Implications for DecarbonizationLet’s face it: aviation accounts for roughly 3% of global CO₂ emissions, and the sector is aiming for near-zero by mid-century. That’s wheregreen hydrogen, born from renewable-poweredhydrogen production, steals the show. It’s the genuine article in zero-emission technology—only water vapor exits the engine. NLR’s HYDRA-2 success offers a clear blueprint for airlines, manufacturers and regulators looking to ditch fossil jet fuels.In the Netherlands, which is busy building out itshydrogen infrastructure, HYDRA-2 can inform national strategy. Imagine regional airports doubling as liquid hydrogen hubs—serving drones, urban air taxis and eventually short-haul airliners. Cracking large-scalehydrogen storageand fueling logistics could also spill over into greener shipping and heavy transport.On the global stage, NLR’s findings feed into ICAO working groups and other forums, shaping certification frameworks for hydrogen-powered aircraft. Sharing real-world data on tank performance, boil-off management and fuel cell reliability smooths the path to international approval.Challenges on the HorizonOf course, it’s not all smooth sailing. Rolling out liquid hydrogen refueling stations demands heavy investment in cryogenic storage, transport and ground support equipment. Without a robust supply chain, adoption could stall. Regulators must strike a balance between safety and innovation when drafting rules for tank certification, maintenance and emergency response.Technically, minimizing boil-off during ground holds is essential—small losses can disrupt mission plans. Maintaining strict hydrogen purity is another must, since contaminants can degrade fuel cell catalysts. On the production side, scaling uphydrogen productionthrough renewable-powered electrolysis still carries a premium, although costs are dropping as capacity grows.Every successful demo like HYDRA-2 chips away at these barriers—providing data, building trust and lighting the way for the next steps.What’s Next?NLR’s Quick Response Drone Facility is gearing up for rapid-fire testing to stretch HYDRA-2’s flight envelope—longer missions, varied payloads and fresh use cases. Partnerships with OEMs aim to scale the tank design for two-seater demonstrators, targeting manned hydrogen flights by late 2025. Meanwhile, Cryoworld is developing next-gen tanks with even lower boil-off and higher capacity. Joint workshops and live drills with regulators will fine-tune operational protocols. If all goes to plan, hydrogen-powered regional flights could be reality by decade’s end.About the Netherlands Aerospace Centre (NLR):NLR is the Dutch government’s aerospace research arm, championingsustainable energy, safety and pioneering innovation.

Their composite storage solutions drive breakthroughs in aerospace, energy and scientific research around the globe.Spread the love From the tank, liquid hydrogen feeds ahydrogen fuel cellsstack—specifically, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) module that splits H₂ into protons and electrons to generate clean electricity. That power drives an efficient electric motor, with water vapor as the only byproduct. Even the waste heat gets a second life via a thermal management loop, boosting efficiency and cutting back on extra cooling needs. In flight, a web of sensors feeds live data—temperatures, pressures, flow rates—to an onboard computer that tweaks power delivery on the fly. With up to five times the specific energy of batteries, hydrogen fuel cells give HYDRA-2 a serious edge on endurance missions.Evolution of Hydrogen AviationHydrogen in aviation isn’t new, but storage has long been the roadblock. Back in 2019, NLR’s HYDRA-1 demo used compressed hydrogen, and while fuel cells worked, high-pressure tanks limited airtime. Switching to liquid hydrogen cranks up energy density—around 120 MJ/kg versus 5 MJ/kg for top-tier batteries—unlocking missions that were previously science fiction. Adapting cryogenic materials and insulation from space applications to continuous flight conditions wasn’t trivial, but HYDRA-2 bridges the gap between niche R&D and scalable, real-world ops.Worldwide, from big research hubs to nimble startups, everyone’s racing to validate hydrogen propulsion for drones and small aircraft. By running liquid hydrogen in a real-world demo, NLR delivers crucial insights on handling, safety and performance—fueling the collective push toward decarbonized flight.Strategic Implications for DecarbonizationLet’s face it: aviation accounts for roughly 3% of global CO₂ emissions, and the sector is aiming for near-zero by mid-century. That’s wheregreen hydrogen, born from renewable-poweredhydrogen production, steals the show. It’s the genuine article in zero-emission technology—only water vapor exits the engine.

In a freshNaturepaperdropped on August 19, 2025, researchers unveiled a breakthrough infuel cell technology: a gel-encapsulated, fiber-shaped platform for next-gendirect methanol fuel cellsthat you can bend, snip, and top up in under a minute. It packs an eye-popping161.36 Wh/kgenergy density, runs smoothly from−22 °C to 70 °C, and sails through over2,000 flexing cycles. That’s a huge leap in weaving high-energy power intowearable electronics—bringing us a big step closer to uninterrupted, seamless juice for our gadgets.Market ContextAs the race for compact, reliable power in health monitors, emergency kits, and the exploding Internet of Things heats up, traditional batteries and rigid fuel cells just don’t cut it. You might get flexibility from solid-state batteries, but they often fall short on energy density. On the flip side, conventional PEM and phosphoric acid fuel cells deliver high output, but only in bulky housings. This new fiber approach leans on a clever gel matrix that self-reinforces under pressure, ditching oversized chambers and setting the stage for truly conformal power in next-genwearable electronics.Strategic ImplicationsIf you’re eyeing thewearable electronicsor smart textile market, this could flip your playbook. Imagine cutting fuel cell “threads” to size, weaving them into garments, then refueling on the fly at room temp—no clunky equipment required. OEMs and textile pros could embed power directly into clothes, slashing weight, complexity, and e-waste. Even aerospace, robotics, and defense teams stand to gain, thanks to a lightweight, refuelable system that laughs off mechanical stress and temperature swings—a real edge in high-stakes, mobile scenarios.Business OutlookMethanol’s no stranger to the global stage—it’s traded in volumes topping 100 million tonnes a year through natural gas reforming and emerging bio-based routes. That means businesses can tap an existing fuel network instead of betting on new hydrogen stations. These gel-wrapped fibers skip pricey extras—no high-pressure tanks or electric compressors—chopping upfront CapEx. For manufacturers, integrating gel-infused threads into textile or composite lines slots right into current weaving and coating setups, keeping unit costs competitive with premium lithium-ion modules. Plus, direct methanol fuel cells boast lower lifecycle emissions than battery production, making them a prime candidate for sustainability incentives or carbon credits. With governments tightening emission targets, jumping on thisclean energytrain could unlock better financing, speed up approvals, and get your next-gen systems to market faster.Technical SnapshotUnder the hood, it’s a simple cotton mesh soaked in a methanol-friendly gel. When fuel meets matrix, the gel swells, cranks up internal pressure, seals fuel channels, and locks down electrode interfaces. Here’s the skinny:Energy density:161.36 Wh/kg—blowing past older fiber-based cells.Mechanical resilience:2,000+ flex cycles with zero fuss.Thermal range:−22 °C to 70 °C—ready for extreme environments.Refuelling:Under 1 minute at ambient conditions—no tools needed.Parallel DevelopmentsOf course, this isn’t the first rodeo forfuel cell technologyor flexible materials. Over the last decade, pioneers toyed with carbon nanotubes and polymer electrolytes, cranking out prototype supercaps and fuel cells that bent okay but tripped up on sealing and power. Back in 2017, an ACS Nano study showed off flexible direct methanol fuel cells with decent flex, but they barely scratched the surface on energy output and quick refueling. In contrast, the new gel-mediated design sets fresh benchmarks in both power and durability, hinting at a real path to commercialization.Expert Viewpoint“It’s brilliant how they lean on everyday cotton and a savvy gel to tackle a tough engineering puzzle,” says Dr. Maya Patel, an energy storage whiz not tied to the study. “Locking in pressure control right inside the cell kills the need for heavy hardware and ups longevity. It’s practical, and scaling it could be surprisingly straightforward.” If the numbers hold up, expect to see pilot tests in medical wearables and remote sensors within two years.Key TakeawaysA record-breaking161.36 Wh/kgenergy density in a fiber format.Cuts to size and lightning-fast (1 min) refueling.Stands tough from−22 °C to 70 °Cand over2,000flex cycles.Seamlessly embeds power into textiles, slashing weight and e-waste.A freshclean energyandsustainable energyalternative to bulky batteries.As the world leans intoclean energyand craves seamless integration, this flexible, gel-encapsulated platform could be a game-changer. It marries high energy density with rugged, textile-friendly form factors, cracking open new horizons for commercial wearables, defense gear, and beyond. Keep an eye out: textile manufacturers and energy outfits could kick off pilot programs by late 2026, setting the stage for consumer rollouts in the early 2030s.Spread the love Market ContextAs the race for compact, reliable power in health monitors, emergency kits, and the exploding Internet of Things heats up, traditional batteries and rigid fuel cells just don’t cut it.

No, it’s not sci-fi—that’s exactly whatspinel ferritesare promising forphotocatalytic water splitting. Fast-forward to June 2025, and researchers are boasting record-breaking efficiencies withMFe2O4(M = Zn, Ni, Co, etc.) nanoparticles. Sure, front-runners likeTiO2andCdSbroke the initial ground, but their wide bandgaps and iffy stability under sunlight limited their real-world clout. These days, spinel ferrites tick every box: they’re made from abundant elements, flaunt narrow bandgaps (~1.9–2.2 eV), and shrug off harsh reaction conditions. By fine-tuningsol-gel processing, weaving in clever dopants, and building smart heterostructures, we’re edging ever closer to commercial-scalegreen hydrogen. Bonus: wrapping these nanoparticles in a conductivepolypyrroleshell is giving them a durability and performance boost that’s hard to ignore.How spinel ferrites workThe real trick lies in the spinel crystal lattice, where octahedral and tetrahedral sites host iron and transition-metal ions in a neat 1:2 ratio. Variants likeNiFe2O4,CoFe2O4, orZnFe2O4tweak their electronic bands just enough to nail the ideal redox potentials. Shine sunlight on them and you get electron-hole pairs: the electrons bust down water to H2, while the holes oxidize it to O2. But the coolest part? These babies are magnetic. After the reaction, you run a magnet around the reactor wall and voilà—the catalyst particles stick like magic, ready for the next round. That magnetic recoverability slashes separation costs and vibes perfectly with broadersustainable energygoals.Engineering breakthroughs: sol-gel, doping & heterostructuresScientists have known forever that uniform nanoparticles make all the difference. That’s wheresol-gel synthesisshines, churning out ferrite particles under 50 nm with spot-on stoichiometry—think higher active surface areas and fewer pesky trap states. Then there’s doping: swapping in Zn or Ni at the M site tweaks the band edges, driving hydrogen evolution rates north of 150 µmol H2∙g–1∙h–1under one sun (100 mW/cm2). And let’s not forget heterostructures—pairing spinel ferrites withTiO2, BiVO4or carbon nitride creates type-II junctions that steer electrons and holes to different zones, cutting recombination losses like a hot knife through butter. One study on mixedNiZnFe2O4/g-C3N4composites reported a 45% bump in turnover frequency compared to unmodified ferrites, proving the power of interface engineering.Polypyrrole nanocomposites amplify performanceWhile spinel ferrites nail light absorption and charge generation, coating them with a conductive polymer likepolypyrrole (Ppy)really turbocharges the deal. By polymerizing it in situ, you get a thin Ppy layer hugging each nanoparticle, creating a slick electron highway and shielding the core from nasty oxidative damage. The result? Some lab setups have doubled their hydrogen output, and they’re still rocking over 90% activity after five-plus cycles. That kind of resilience is exactly what you need for industrial uptime—no one wants to swap catalysts mid-shift.Market implications and the push for industrial decarbonizationWith net-zero pledges flooding in across the globe,green hydrogenhas vaulted to the top of the energy agenda. Cash is pouring into renewables-powered electrolyzers, yet catalyst costs still sting—especially when platinum-group metals dominate. That’s wherespinel ferritesstep in: cheap, earth-abundant iron and first-row transition metals that early economic models say could chop catalyst expenses by up to 60%. Imagine hydrogen fuel cells driving heavy-duty trucks, clean ammonia plants churning out zero-carbon fertilizer, and steel mills ditching coal. The result? Big wins inindustrial decarbonization.Scaling up: hurdles and breakthroughsWhat works in a beaker doesn’t always translate to giant reactors. You need uniform light distribution, smart heat management, and pristine water to keep the catalysts from fouling. On the manufacturing side, cranking out tens of kilograms of sol-gel–synthesized nanoparticles with consistent quality? Easier said than done. But pilots are already in motion: academic teams teaming up with engineering firms to build 1–5 L photoreactors that circulate magnetic catalysts in thin films for top-notch photon capture. Hit those performance milestones, and we could see commercial-scale pilot stations by late 2026.Environmental and collateral impactsCue the reality check: mining nickel and cobalt can be resource-intensive and polluting if it’s done without care. That said, compared to cadmium-based catalysts, spinel ferrites dodge some major toxicity concerns. Plus, magnetic recovery keeps more catalyst in play and trims waste disposal headaches. A full life-cycle assessment would weigh mining impacts against CO2savings from ditching grey hydrogen. Early estimates hint at over a 70% cut in greenhouse gas emissions, even after factoring in feedstock extraction.Looking aheadSo, arespinel ferritesthe game-changer forhydrogen production? They’re not a one-size-fits-all silver bullet, but they’ve certainly earned their spot on the shortlist. As synthesis methods mature, interface tweaks sharpen, and scale-up kinks get ironed out, these catalysts might one day rival traditional electrolysis—without relying on pricey noble metals. What we’re seeing is a steady climb toward a sunlight-driven, trulysustainable energyfuture, and trust me, we’re just scratching the surface.Spread the love The real trick lies in the spinel crystal lattice, where octahedral and tetrahedral sites host iron and transition-metal ions in a neat 1:2 ratio.

Early estimates hint at over a 70% cut in greenhouse gas emissions, even after factoring in feedstock extraction.Looking aheadSo, arespinel ferritesthe game-changer forhydrogen production? They’re not a one-size-fits-all silver bullet, but they’ve certainly earned their spot on the shortlist. As synthesis methods mature, interface tweaks sharpen, and scale-up kinks get ironed out, these catalysts might one day rival traditional electrolysis—without relying on pricey noble metals. What we’re seeing is a steady climb toward a sunlight-driven, trulysustainable energyfuture, and trust me, we’re just scratching the surface.Spread the love While spinel ferrites nail light absorption and charge generation, coating them with a conductive polymer likepolypyrrole (Ppy)really turbocharges the deal. By polymerizing it in situ, you get a thin Ppy layer hugging each nanoparticle, creating a slick electron highway and shielding the core from nasty oxidative damage. The result? Some lab setups have doubled their hydrogen output, and they’re still rocking over 90% activity after five-plus cycles. That kind of resilience is exactly what you need for industrial uptime—no one wants to swap catalysts mid-shift.Market implications and the push for industrial decarbonizationWith net-zero pledges flooding in across the globe,green hydrogenhas vaulted to the top of the energy agenda. Cash is pouring into renewables-powered electrolyzers, yet catalyst costs still sting—especially when platinum-group metals dominate. That’s wherespinel ferritesstep in: cheap, earth-abundant iron and first-row transition metals that early economic models say could chop catalyst expenses by up to 60%. Imagine hydrogen fuel cells driving heavy-duty trucks, clean ammonia plants churning out zero-carbon fertilizer, and steel mills ditching coal. The result? Big wins inindustrial decarbonization.Scaling up: hurdles and breakthroughsWhat works in a beaker doesn’t always translate to giant reactors. You need uniform light distribution, smart heat management, and pristine water to keep the catalysts from fouling. On the manufacturing side, cranking out tens of kilograms of sol-gel–synthesized nanoparticles with consistent quality? Easier said than done. But pilots are already in motion: academic teams teaming up with engineering firms to build 1–5 L photoreactors that circulate magnetic catalysts in thin films for top-notch photon capture. Hit those performance milestones, and we could see commercial-scale pilot stations by late 2026.Environmental and collateral impactsCue the reality check: mining nickel and cobalt can be resource-intensive and polluting if it’s done without care.

This 1,595 sqm sanctuary, designed to welcome over 1,300 worshippers, sits at the heart of a masterplan for smart, low-carbon urban communities. This delivery not only pushes the mosque closer to its goal ofLEED Zero Carbon certificationbut also shines a light on the power of public-private teamwork and the UAE’s fast-track sprint toward its 2050 net-zero targets and broadersustainable energygoals.Key InsightsThis project is the first big-scale application ofgreen hydrogenin steelmaking across the region, chopping CO₂ emissions by up to 95% compared to traditional blast furnaces.Back in October 2024,EMSTEELandMasdarran a pilot that churned out 5,000 tonnes of certified green steel, proving the concept works at scale.Aldar Propertiesearns bragging rights as the region’s first developer to use hydrogen-based steel in a landmark building.The mosque’s design leans on thick rammed earth walls, passive cooling, solar panels, low-carbon concrete, and energy-efficient LED lighting to serve over 1,300 visitors across 1,595 sqm.Avance LabsandBureau Veritasindependently stamped the steel with global sustainability certifications, making sure it ticks all the right boxes.This effort revs up the UAE’sindustrial decarbonizationplaybook, eyeing a 40% emissions drop by 2030 on the road to net-zero by 2050.Green Hydrogen and Steel: A Closer LookAt the core of this milestone isgreen hydrogen-fueled steelmaking. In that October 2024 pilot,Masdar’s renewable-powered electrolyzers whipped up hydrogen that replaced natural gas and coal for direct iron ore reduction. Thanks to thishydrogen productionroute, sponge iron emerges with nothing but water vapor as a byproduct, slashing carbon emissions by about 95% over standard blast furnace methods. That same process cranked out 5,000 tonnes of green steel for the mosque, all independently verified byAvance LabsandBureau Veritasagainst international low-emission benchmarks.What’s more, the whole setup taps into Masdar City’s solar and wind microgrid, ensuring the electrolytic hydrogen—and ultimately the rebar—carries almost zero embedded carbon. After the reduction stage, the sponge iron gets melted, alloyed, and transformed into rebar under tight quality controls. Over at EMSTEEL’s Fujairah plant, the bars are rolled, cooled, and prepped for delivery, showing how top-notchzero-emission technologycan slide right into conventional supply lines without skimping on strength or breaking the bank.EMSTEEL isn’t stopping here. Their roadmap calls for cranking up green steel output to 100,000 tonnes a year by 2030, setting the stage for a fully net-zero production line by 2050. Hitting those targets means adding more electrolyzers, signing up fresh renewable power deals, and fine-tuning every step of the process. Early numbers hint that, once you scale up,green hydrogencould dip below $1.50/kg, making the whole approach not just eco-friendly but also commercially sustainable—ready to roll out beyond headline projects like this mosque.Designing the Net-Zero MosqueThe mosque’s look is all about blending time-honored Islamic architecture with next-gen sustainability. Those heftyrammed earthwalls, crafted from local soil, give the space thermal mass that keeps indoor temps steady in Abu Dhabi’s heat. Combined with passive cooling vents and courtyards strategically placed for natural airflow, they slash HVAC energy use by over 35%. Up top, solar panels generate a hefty chunk of the mosque’s power needs, running LED lights, efficient water pumps, and even the ablution stations.Spanning 1,595 sqm and built for more than 1,300 worshippers, the design also calls for low-carbon concrete mixes and ethically sourced carpets. Every fixture and finish gets scrutinized for low embodied emissions, while the hydrogen-based rebar ties it all together to meet the strictestLEED Zero Carbonstandards. The result? A public building that’s both spiritually uplifting and a showcase for next-levelsustainable energydesign.Strategic Partnership and Market ImplicationsEMSTEEL,Aldar Properties, andMasdarhave stitched together a partnership that fast-tracks low-carbon materials at scale. For EMSTEEL, the mosque is a live demo of their green steel credentials, amping up investor confidence as they eye future listings. Aldar, already a trailblazer for hydrogen-based steel, cements its green-building reputation and optimizes its supply chain. Masdar, with its mix of solar farms and wind assets, anchors the entire setup, proving how an integrated renewable energy portfolio can power heavy industry.On top of that, the project highlights why smart policy matters. The UAE’s Net Zero by 2050 strategy, alongside incentives for green construction, has created fertile ground for innovation. As carbon disclosure becomes a must for big developments, early movers like this trio can tap into green finance at attractive rates, tipping the scales in favor of sustainable materials.Regional Impact and Future StepsThis net-zero mosque isn’t just a standalone win; it’s a springboard for regionalindustrial decarbonization. By showing there’s a clear playbook for both making and using green steel, it takes the fear out of the unknown for other players thinking aboutgreen hydrogenand zero-emission building materials. Workshops are already on the calendar for late 2025, where engineers, architects, and procurement teams from across the GCC can learn the ropes. Plans are also afoot to boost electrolyzer capacity past 50 MW, fueled by green bonds and public-private funding.Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and other neighbors are watching closely. If this mosque checks all the boxes, it could spur new regional standards for low-emission building codes and even shape carbon credit markets linked to sustainable materials. Lenders and investors are tracking the project’s numbers, ready to back the next wave ofzero-emission technologyventures.OutlookWe’re at a real crossroads wheregreen hydrogenmeets centuries-old craftsmanship. This mosque proves you don’t have to choose between heritage and climate action. As the UAE marches toward its 2050 net-zero goals, projects like this will set the pace for mainstreaming hydrogen-based steel and other clean materials. And if costs keep sliding and regulations stay supportive, we could soon seezero-emission technologypopping up in construction projects all around the Middle East—and beyond.Spread the love Key InsightsThis project is the first big-scale application ofgreen hydrogenin steelmaking across the region, chopping CO₂ emissions by up to 95% compared to traditional blast furnaces.Back in October 2024,EMSTEELandMasdarran a pilot that churned out 5,000 tonnes of certified green steel, proving the concept works at scale.Aldar Propertiesearns bragging rights as the region’s first developer to use hydrogen-based steel in a landmark building.The mosque’s design leans on thick rammed earth walls, passive cooling, solar panels, low-carbon concrete, and energy-efficient LED lighting to serve over 1,300 visitors across 1,595 sqm.Avance LabsandBureau Veritasindependently stamped the steel with global sustainability certifications, making sure it ticks all the right boxes.This effort revs up the UAE’sindustrial decarbonizationplaybook, eyeing a 40% emissions drop by 2030 on the road to net-zero by 2050.Green Hydrogen and Steel: A Closer LookAt the core of this milestone isgreen hydrogen-fueled steelmaking.

This halt, which will last until they unveil a majorcapital raising, highlights just how deep the pockets need to be to scale upclean hydrogenventures. Around the world, investments in hydrogen are booming as governments and industry race toward zero-emission solutions for heavy transport and big industrial players. For a country gearing up to be a top exporter of green hydrogen, Pure Hydrogen’s decision is a pivotal moment in Australia’s energy transition.A Strategic PauseTrading halts aren’t exactly headline-grabbing news, but they’re par for the course when firms are about to drop material updates. In Pure Hydrogen’s case, this freeze buys time to lock in a non-renounceable placement—think of it as an invite-only share offer for institutional and sophisticated investors. That’s great for execution speed and regulatory peace of mind, but it usually means dilution for existing holders. Beyond the usual compliance box-checking, this pause signals a serious upcoming capital call to fund everything from electrolysis plants to compression units and refuelling hubs.Funding the Hydrogen PushWhy the big ask? Because making hydrogen work for heavy transport is no small feat. Electrolysers, which use electricity to split water into hydrogen, can gobble up 40–50% of your project budget right off the bat. Layer on the costs of rolling out a nationwide network of hydrogen refuelling stations and certifying fuel cell trucks, and you’ve got a capital-intensive game. Industry vets say that economies of scale and module standardization will tame those costs—if you can secure hefty equity or project financing. This capital raise aims to supercharge Pure Hydrogen’s R&D, ramp up production of its signature prime movers, and speed up the build-out of essentialhydrogen infrastructureto improve unit economics.Pure Hydrogen’s FootprintSince its ASX debut in 2021,Pure Hydrogenhas been methodically piecing together an end-to-end hydrogen ecosystem. They’ve teamed up with logistics heavyweight TOLL Group to trial hydrogen-powered prime movers, deployed mobile refuellers for regional government fleets, and kicked off feasibility studies for solar-driven hydrogen hubs in Victoria and South Australia. By owning the entire chain—from onsite electrolysis and compression through to storage and distribution—they’re banking on vertical integration to keep costs in check and quality consistent. A recent framework deal with a renewable energy developer further underscores their strategy for locking in both feedstock and long-term offtake.Australia’s Clean Energy DriveAustralia’s pledge to hit net-zero by 2050 puts hydrogen front and centre in its clean energy plans. The country’s abundant solar and wind resources make grid-powered electrolysis an obvious play, and states like Queensland and New South Wales have already laid down multimillion-dollarhydrogen infrastructureroadmaps. Federal grants and guaranteed off-take schemes have kickstarted dozens of pilot plants, but moving from small-scale demos to gigawatt-class electrolysers and export terminals means one thing: private capital. Pure Hydrogen’s upcoming placement could bridge that funding gap and help position Australia as the go-to green hydrogen exporter for Asia-Pacific markets.Market and Investor ImpactA trading halt means shareholders can’t trade, and that lack of liquidity often brings jitters and short-term swings. Once Pure Hydrogen pulls back the curtain on placement details, analysts will tear into pricing, dilution levels and any anchor investors in the mix. A well-supported raise could reignite buying momentum, but if the offer comes at a steep discount, expect downward pressure on the share price. Meanwhile, early backers who get in now might lock down strategic partnerships and construction slots ahead of competitors chasing the same grants and grid connections.Implications for StakeholdersThe ripple effects of this capital call stretch far beyond just investors. Equipment manufacturers—think electrolysers, high-pressure storage tanks and compressors—stand to see order books fill up if those large-scale projects get green-lit. Construction contractors could see a steady pipeline of work for plant builds, while logistics operators planning hydrogen fleet rollouts will finally get a clearer timetable for station availability. Regional communities pitched for new green hydrogen hubs might see fresh jobs and infrastructure upgrades. At the end of the day, this raise could unlock economic activity across the entirehydrogen energy market.Technical Snapshot: Fuel Cell VehiclesHydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity through an electrochemical reaction, with pure water vapor as the only byproduct. The real draw? Refuelling takes minutes—comparable to diesel—and the range is hefty, making FCVs a strong fit for heavy-duty workhorses like prime movers. But costs are steep thanks to platinum catalysts, rugged high-pressure tanks and specialized power electronics. Getting production volumes up and securing government incentives will be crucial to push down per-unit prices and accelerate fleet adoption ofhydrogen fuel cells.Parallel Moves in the SectorPure Hydrogen’s trading halt is just one act in a bigger play. Across the ASX, other clean energy players—from biogas developers to battery storage outfits—have pressed pause on trading to shore up funding. It’s a reminder that government pledges alone won’t flip the switch on emerging tech at scale. The real missing piece? Private investment. If Pure Hydrogen nails its placement, it could spark a domino effect of capital raises as rivals and partners hustle to lock in their hydrogen ambitions.Next Steps and OutlookInvestors are on standby for the ASX announcement, expected in the coming days. The market will be watching the total size of the placement, any discount to market price, and which big-name backers are stepping up. A solid institutional line-up could turbocharge Pure Hydrogen’s push into full-scale refuelling networks and fuel cell fleet deployments across Australia. If the raise falls short, they might have to explore joint ventures with energy majors or lean on project finance structures to keep momentum going.In the race to build outhydrogen infrastructure, cash is the real differentiator between pilots and commercial rollouts. Pure Hydrogen’s trading halt isn’t just a box-ticking exercise—it’s a defining chapter in Australia’s quest to dominate the globalhydrogen energy market. The outcome will reveal who’s got the financial firepower to turn the promise of hydrogen into a green reality for heavy transport and industry.Spread the love A Strategic PauseTrading halts aren’t exactly headline-grabbing news, but they’re par for the course when firms are about to drop material updates.

Pure Hydrogen’s trading halt isn’t just a box-ticking exercise—it’s a defining chapter in Australia’s quest to dominate the globalhydrogen energy market. The outcome will reveal who’s got the financial firepower to turn the promise of hydrogen into a green reality for heavy transport and industry.Spread the love Pure Hydrogen’s FootprintSince its ASX debut in 2021,Pure Hydrogenhas been methodically piecing together an end-to-end hydrogen ecosystem. They’ve teamed up with logistics heavyweight TOLL Group to trial hydrogen-powered prime movers, deployed mobile refuellers for regional government fleets, and kicked off feasibility studies for solar-driven hydrogen hubs in Victoria and South Australia. By owning the entire chain—from onsite electrolysis and compression through to storage and distribution—they’re banking on vertical integration to keep costs in check and quality consistent. A recent framework deal with a renewable energy developer further underscores their strategy for locking in both feedstock and long-term offtake.Australia’s Clean Energy DriveAustralia’s pledge to hit net-zero by 2050 puts hydrogen front and centre in its clean energy plans. The country’s abundant solar and wind resources make grid-powered electrolysis an obvious play, and states like Queensland and New South Wales have already laid down multimillion-dollarhydrogen infrastructureroadmaps. Federal grants and guaranteed off-take schemes have kickstarted dozens of pilot plants, but moving from small-scale demos to gigawatt-class electrolysers and export terminals means one thing: private capital. Pure Hydrogen’s upcoming placement could bridge that funding gap and help position Australia as the go-to green hydrogen exporter for Asia-Pacific markets.Market and Investor ImpactA trading halt means shareholders can’t trade, and that lack of liquidity often brings jitters and short-term swings. Once Pure Hydrogen pulls back the curtain on placement details, analysts will tear into pricing, dilution levels and any anchor investors in the mix. A well-supported raise could reignite buying momentum, but if the offer comes at a steep discount, expect downward pressure on the share price. Meanwhile, early backers who get in now might lock down strategic partnerships and construction slots ahead of competitors chasing the same grants and grid connections.Implications for StakeholdersThe ripple effects of this capital call stretch far beyond just investors. Equipment manufacturers—think electrolysers, high-pressure storage tanks and compressors—stand to see order books fill up if those large-scale projects get green-lit. Construction contractors could see a steady pipeline of work for plant builds, while logistics operators planning hydrogen fleet rollouts will finally get a clearer timetable for station availability. Regional communities pitched for new green hydrogen hubs might see fresh jobs and infrastructure upgrades. At the end of the day, this raise could unlock economic activity across the entirehydrogen energy market.Technical Snapshot: Fuel Cell VehiclesHydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity through an electrochemical reaction, with pure water vapor as the only byproduct. The real draw? Refuelling takes minutes—comparable to diesel—and the range is hefty, making FCVs a strong fit for heavy-duty workhorses like prime movers. But costs are steep thanks to platinum catalysts, rugged high-pressure tanks and specialized power electronics. Getting production volumes up and securing government incentives will be crucial to push down per-unit prices and accelerate fleet adoption ofhydrogen fuel cells.Parallel Moves in the SectorPure Hydrogen’s trading halt is just one act in a bigger play.

WithKen Ramirez—the new Executive Vice President and head of the Energy and Hydrogen Business Division—leading the charge, they’re taking things way beyond just fuel cell cars and trucks. Get this: under Ramirez, who arrived from Renault-Nissan, Hyundai isn’t just selling vehicles anymore. They’ve built an all-in-one hydrogen universe—production, storage, transport, distribution, you name it—under theirHTWO platform. They even showed off this fully integrated model at both ACT Expo in California and the World Hydrogen Summit 2025. In a nutshell, Hyundai’s gone from automaker to orchestrator of a full-blown hydrogen economy, weaving together R&D, capital, and partners into a scalable, global play.Historical Context: A Legacy of InnovationSince its founding in 1967,Hyundai Motor Groupbuilt its name on mass-market cars and heavy machinery. Fast forward to the early 2000s, when curious R&D crews dipped their toes into hydrogen. That early work led to passengerfuel cell vehicleslike the NEXO, which quickly set high bars for reliability, and the commercialXCIENTheavy-duty truck. Pilot projects even tested high-pressure refueling, paving the way for government-backed hydrogen incentives—especially in South Korea. Those first steps of making and moving hydrogen laid the groundwork for today’s fully integratedhydrogen value chain, where manufacturing, engineering, and supply logistics all tie together.How Hydrogen Fuel Cells Work: Clean Power on DemandAt the core of this real-world breakthrough is the humble hydrogen fuel cell—a neat little gadget that turns hydrogen and oxygen into electricity, with only water and heat as byproducts. Here’s the skinny: hydrogen molecules split at the anode, freeing up protons and electrons. The protons slip through a membrane while the electrons do the heavy lifting—powering motors or generators—before they all reunite with oxygen at the cathode. What you get is on-demand, zero-emission power. From passenger cars to heavy trucks, marine vessels to remote generators, fuel cells can balance grids, back up critical infrastructure, and kick CO₂ and particulates to the curb.HTWO: Secret Sauce for a Seamless EcosystemTheHTWO platformis Hyundai’s open-door blueprint for hydrogen success. It pulls together internal units likeHyundai E&Cwith energy majors, infrastructure specialists, and tech firms, covering everything from green hydrogen production and high-pressure storage to pipeline logistics, truck transport, and public refueling stations. They’re even exploring Waste-to-Hydrogen (W2H) tech to turn trash into fuel, slashing feedstock costs. By inviting co-investors and sharing roadmaps, HTWO aims to make hydrogen as easy to use as diesel—speeding up global market readiness for robusthydrogen infrastructure.Advanced Driver Assistance Systems: The AI EdgeHyundai’s fuel cell trucks aren’t just clean—they’re smart. Built-inADAStech—radar, LiDAR, cameras, and predictive analytics—offers everything from lane-keeping and adaptive cruise to collision alerts and telematics integration. This AI-driven toolkit cuts downtime, slashes maintenance bills, and boosts driver confidence—key for fleets comparing hydrogen to electric or diesel options.Global Footprint: South Korea, USA & IndonesiaHyundai’s rolling out hydrogen plants and refueling networks across South Korea, home to 52 million people and major industrial hubs like Ulsan and Yeouido, all thanks to government roadmaps. Over in Georgia, USA, their October 2024 facility churns out both electric and hydrogen vehicles, turning the state into a logistics and innovation hot spot. At ACT Expo in Anaheim, California, they spotlight both XCIENT heavy-duty trucks and the HTWO ecosystem in action. Meanwhile, in Indonesia, strategic partnerships are setting the stage for new hydrogen production sites and export routes—tapping into Southeast Asia’s growing thirst for clean fuels.Engineering the Future with Hyundai E&CHyundai Engineering & Constructionis the linchpin of theH-Roadinitiative, linking green hydrogen facilities to nuclear plants and eyeing small modular reactors (SMRs) for co-generation. By feeding large electrolyzers with stable, low-carbon power, they promise steady hydrogen output. Add investments in lithium for battery synergies, and you’ve got cross-division collaboration on full display. H-Road cements Hyundai E&C’s role in next-gen energy infrastructure, including pilot projects with national utilities.Collateral Impacts: Jobs, Standards & TransformationThis hydrogen push isn’t just about cleaner transport—it’s spawning new jobs in engineering, construction, maintenance, and R&D. University partnerships are sprouting catalysts and tech labs, while port authorities, tram networks, and maritime fleets get clear guidelines through evolving ISO frameworks. By swapping out fossil fuels in heavy logistics and industrial power, Hyundai is fueling a wider shift toward net-zero targets and proving that hydrogen can scale across industries.Challenges, Solutions & The Road AheadLet’s be real: scaling up hydrogen isn’t a walk in the park. Electrolyzer costs are still steep, refueling stations need to multiply, and feedstock availability can swing. Energy price swings add extra headaches, and aligning international rules is an ongoing puzzle. Hyundai’s tackling these hurdles head-on—partnering with energy giants, kicking off W2H pilots, and fine-tuning ADAS for peak efficiency. Their openHTWO platformattracts investors and tech collaborators, while the H-Road initiative taps nuclear to steady supply. These proof points and emerging standards are paving the way for wider adoption of the hydrogen value chain.Bottom line:Hyundai Motor Grouphas flipped the script on hydrogen—transforming from a mobility player into a vertically integrated, global hydrogen powerhouse. With theHTWO platformat its core, Hyundai is setting the pace for the energy transition. As demand for clean energy ramps up, their all-in-one approach may well become the blueprint for industry-wide adoption.Spread the love Historical Context: A Legacy of InnovationSince its founding in 1967,Hyundai Motor Groupbuilt its name on mass-market cars and heavy machinery.

Image: Jorrit Lousberg/Light at Work Photography The latest 3,000 kmBridgestone World Solar Challengeacross Australia from Darwin to Adelaide is scheduled run until August 31, 2025. At the end of the fourth day, the top three teams in the Challenger class have been leadingsince early on in the competition,as sister publicationpv magazine Australiahas been reporting. There was less than 10 minutes separating them at the most recent checkpoint, according tothe latest dispatch. The top three teams so far are Brunel Solar Team from the Netherlands, Belgium solar racing team Innoptus, and Solar Team Twente, also from the Netherlands. The event is being held in the winterfor the first time.The Challenger class is a single passenger vehicle with minimum three wheels, and a maximum of 6 m2 solar collector area. The Brunel team has 18 members from Delft University of Technology, participating with the Nuna 13 racer. Its spokesperson confirmed topv magazinethat the solar deck has 350 back contact cells supplied by Chinese module manufacturerAiko. It also has a new removable “swordfin” to be used dependant on wind conditions. The University of Leuven's Innoptus Solar Team, whichwon the previous two editionsof the race, is driving Infinite Apollo. Its solar partner this year is Chinese vertically-integrated solar manufacturerLongi.The spokesperson confirmed that Longi supplied 27%-efficient back contact cells, as well as support for the vehicle-integrated photovoltaic (VIPV) solution. It has used a fin for stability before and this year it took it a step further with a double fin design. The asymmetric fins are meant to handle a wider range of wind angles, according to the team spokesperson. “Solar-powered racing cars are the ultimate test for PV technology,” said Wout Rubbrecht, the Innoptus Solar Team leader in an earlier statement about the collaboration. “Racing cars need to maintain efficient power generation under conditions of high-intensity vibration, extreme temperature differences, and curved body shapes.” Solar Team Twente, with 17 members from University of Twente, Saxion University of Applied Sciences and ROC van Twente, is competing with its latest car, Red Discover. It does not have a fin. It is using high performance back contact solar cells supplied by Aiko, which deliver superior efficiency, capturing more light “with fewer losses,” according to a press release. The fastest qualifying vehicle of the 2025 edition was the Covestro Aethon fromSonnenwagen Aachen, a student team from RWTH Aachen University and and FH Aachen in Germany. It is in fourth place, according to the last check-in. Its spokesperson toldpv magazinethat Netherlands-based PV specialistMito Solarproduced the solar array based on monocrystalline back contact silicon solar cells and tandem perovskite-silicon solar cells. The tandem devices, supplied by UK startupOxford PV,are embedded across the rear of the deck, while the others are fixed at the front.

Image: AgainErick, Wikimedia Commons CC SA 4.0 The US federal trade court has handed an unreserved victory to plaintiffs in a case that argued a two-year Biden-administration moratorium on collections of duties on imports of cells and modules from Southeast Asia was illegal,pv magazine USAhas learned. The US Court of International Trade decision represents a hard blow to developers and importers who brought in huge amounts of low-priced, largely Chinese-made solar imports from Southeast Asia over the two years between June 6, 2022, and June 6, 2024. The decision means that US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) immediately can begin extracting tens of billions of dollars in duties on cells and modules imported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam during the moratorium. The Coalition for a Prosperous America, a nonprofit organization that backs policy to bolster US manufacturing, agriculture and labor, this past spring said it conservatively estimated that the retroactively applied tariffs could capture $54 billion for the US Treasury, according to its report titled “Revenue Impact of Retroactive Duties on U.S. Solar Imports under the 2022-2024 Tariff Moratorium.” The report also found that retroactive assessment of moratorium duties could “level the playing field for American solar producers who have struggled against subsidized and artificially low-priced imports linked directly to China.” “It’s a clear win,” Thomas Beline, attorney for plaintiffs Auxin Solar Inc. and Concept Clean Energy Inc., toldpv magazine USA. The two companies backed the legal challenge of the moratorium’s suspension of duty collections. The case pivoted on the legality of federal Proclamation 10414, a Biden administration order to create a two-year emergency moratorium on collections of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on solar cells and modules from the four Southeast Asian countries. The moratorium’s emergency intent was to keep import channels flowing to support the US solar deployment, though the US government had preliminarily found that Chinese companies were using the Southeast Asian countries to circumvent existing tariffs. A coalition of companies led by Auxin Solar, Qcells and First Solar had brought the Southeast Asian so-called anti-circumvention cases. As a result of the moratorium, the US Department of Commerce directed CBP to stop collecting duties during the two-year pause. Auxin Solar and Concept Clean Energy challenged the moratorium, asserting that Biden’s suspension of duties exceeded his presidential authority and Commerce’s implementation of the duty suspension was unlawful. The plaintiffs contended that the moratorium unfairly permitted imports priced at unfairly low levels to enter the US market and undermine the domestic manufacturing industry. The plaintiffs’ victory means the US government must vacate all duty-suspension measures in the case and collect duties on all imports yet to be cleared of tariffs that were brought into the country during the moratorium. These duties could cause extensive pain and uncertainty for importers, developers and utilities who channeled the low-priced gear into projects that are now completed, as duties totaling up to more than 200% of the imports’ values may be collected. For relevant moratorium importers as a group, duty exposure could be considerable, Beline said. “Even within the current tariff regime, it’s a ton.” Defending participants in the moratorium case now can appeal the decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, ask for a stay on duty collections pending appeal or pursue political avenues for quashing them. They include the American Clean Power Association, BYD Co., Canadian Solar, Invenergy Renewables, NextEra Energy Inc., Risen Solar Technology, the Solar Energy Industries Association and Trina Solar Inc. Beline suggested that the decision stands as an object lesson about the risks of reckless profit-taking amid a time of trade disputation. “People got drunk and disorderly during this period of time,” though, he said, “taking prices that low is not a good idea.” In effect, Beline also said, the court found that the US president has the prerogative to declare an industrial-trade emergency but not to abrogate duty impositions already on the books, he said. “It was a very poor decision at the time, and hopefully this won’t happen again,” Beline said. The court recently released a bare-minimum outline of its decision. A complete decision, excluding information deemed to be confidential, is expected out by week’s end on the court’sweb listing of opinions.

The “State of the Energy Market 2025” report from the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) shows the generation mix is rapidly shifting with rooftop solar capacity increasing by 13% to 23 GW during 2024, equivalent to 25% of all generation capacity in the NEM. During the first six months of 2025, those rooftop solar systems contributed 14.7% of the NEM’s total generation output, more than utility-scale solar (9.3%), wind power (13.7%), hydro (4.9%) and gas (3.5%). While the rollout of rooftop solar continues, the rate of home battery installations is also on the rise with 74,582 units installed last year, up from 46,127 in 2023 and marking a 62% year-on-year increase. Installation rates have continued to surge with 19,592 home batteries installed across Australia last month, with a total nominal capacity of 356.6 MWh. AER Chair Clare Savage said the profile of energy generation in Australia is in the midst of a major transition driven by decarbonization, the decentralization of energy services and new technology. “In 2024, over 5 GW of new solar, wind, battery and gas capacity entered the NEM, the largest annual new entry of capacity since the NEM began in 1998,” she said. “By the end of the year, renewable technologies including rooftop solar, solar farms, wind, hydro and batteries made up 60% of the NEM’s generation capacity and contributed 39% of generation output, representing a significant increase over the past decade.” Savage said technological developments and consumer preferences are steering the market away from a supply-side orientated system to one that needs to support two-way flows of electricity, and away from centralized generation to distributed generation. In the 10 years to December 2024, 18.2 GW of rooftop solar and 18.5 GW of large-scale wind and solar capacity joined the NEM. Over the same decade, more than 6.6 GW of coal- and gas-powered generation exited the market. The increase of renewables, including large amounts of consumer energy resources (CER), does present challenges, including potential network congestion and making grid operation more difficult. “As the system continues to evolve consumer energy resources (CER) must be effectively integrated and coordinated to help achieve a least-cost transition, with networks evolving to support these new energy services and ensuring they are utilizing their full capacity,” Savage said. Electricity consumption in the NEM rose by 3.4% in 2024, about one-third of this increase was met by increased rooftop solar generation rather than being supplied through the grid. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) forecasts that future energy consumption from the grid will grow by about 108% between now and 2050 as the economy moves towards more intensive electrification of industry and transport. Business and industry consumption is forecast to more than double from today’s 145 TWh to almost 345 TWh in 2050. This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

India installed 18 GW of solar projects in the first half of 2025, a 31% increase from the same period in 2024, according to Mercom India Research’s new “Q2 2025 India Solar Market Update” report. Large-scale additions rose 20% year on year, up from 12.6 GW in the first half of 2024. The report attributed the surge in project commissioning to regulatory deadlines. Developers sought partial commissioning before June 2025 to secure a full waiver on interstate transmission charges, supported by rising demand from distribution companies for round-the-clock renewable power. Of the 18 GW added, 11.3 GW was installed in the second quarter – 145.4% higher than the 4.6 GW in the same period of 2024. Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Maharashtra led capacity additions, accounting for 33.7%, 27%, and 17.4% of installations, respectively. “India’s solar installations surged in Q2 with over 11 GW added, making it one of the strongest quarters to date,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. “Developers continue to face shortages of DCR-compliant modules, transmission and substation bottlenecks, and delays in PPA signings. Without stronger domestic manufacturing output and balanced policy interventions, installations will remain under pressure and lag behind the expanding pipeline.” As of June 30, 2025, India’s cumulative installed solar capacity reached 116.4 GW. Large-scale projects made up nearly 86% of the total, while rooftop systems contributed about 14%. Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Karnataka were the top three states for cumulative large-scale capacity, accounting for roughly 29%, 18%, and 13% of installations, respectively. India’s large-scale solar pipeline stood at nearly 191 GW, with more than 131 GW of projects tendered and awaiting auction as of June 2025.

Image: Guardia Civil, Ministerio del Interior A forest fire that burned roughly 800 hectares in Casas de Don Pedro, in Spain’s southern province of Badajoz, in June originated inside a photovoltaic plant, according to SEPRONA. Investigators determined through forensic inspection that the fire began in a box that overheated the solar panel tracking system. It spread rapidly due to high temperatures and gaps in the plant’s implementation of the Extremadura Forest Fire Prevention Plan (PREIFEX). SEPRONA has been investigating the fire since last June near the Casas de Don Pedro plant, in the Las Trescientas and Navalallegua areas. Endesa, a subsidiary of the Italian multinational Enel, built several 127 MW photovoltaic plants there following Spain’s third renewable energy auction in July 2017. In 2022, the company integrated crops into some of these plants. The Civil Guard has opened an investigation into a local resident responsible for the power plant. Weather conditions accelerated the fire, and the proximity of isolated homes and livestock facilities prompted authorities to declare a level 1 hazard. The blaze affected pasture, crops, holm oak forests, and scrubland, with damage reported by about a dozen residents to government offices. Firefighters deployed four helicopters, two small planes, a seaplane, 15 fire trucks and crews, environmentalists, technicians, medical services, local council personnel, and Civil Guard patrols. Authorities brought the fire under control after roughly four hours. This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

JA Solar has la...", "full_text": "JA Solar has launched DesertBlue, a 650 W tunnel-oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) module for desert PV projects, featuring self-cleaning glass, reinforced frames, and heat-tolerant design with desert-specific certification. JA Solar has introduced DesertBlue, a photovoltaic module series designed for large ground-mounted projects in desert, Gobi, and arid regions. The launch in Beijing brought together engineering institutes and developers, including Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey & Design Institute and ACWA Power, along with certification bodies TÜV Rheinland, TÜV SÜD, and CCIC. JA Solar said DesertBlue addresses four key operating risks in sandy environments: fine-particle soiling that reduces transmittance, coarse-grain abrasion that accelerates film aging, high wind loads that stress module structures, and extreme ambient temperatures that lower output and speed material degradation. The modules target up to 650 W nameplate power output with a peak conversion efficiency of 24%. JA Solar highlights four performance pillars. First, a nano-scale self-cleaning coating with dense microstructures and antistatic properties reduces dust adhesion, letting wind assist cleaning; light-transmittance loss is more than 32% lower than conventional module glass. Second, durability and wear resistance are increased, with at least a 32% uplift in reliability metrics, a service-life extension of three to five years, and strengthened film hardness cutting power loss by 14% under heavy sand exposure. Third, mechanical resilience is enhanced via structural reinforcement and a high-strength steel frame, delivering 6,000 Pa front-side and 4,000 Pa back-side load ratings—over 60% higher than standard designs—while the conductive frame reduces grounding material requirements and associated emissions. Fourth, high-temperature performance is improved: a temperature coefficient of –0.28%/°C combined with TOPCon cells’ higher open-circuit voltage is expected to lift energy yield by 0.5–0.6% at 50°C ambient and 75–85°C module operating temperatures. In dusty conditions, module operating temperature is claimed to fall by about 5°C, equivalent to roughly 1.5% additional yield. JA Solar quantified user economics. In construction, the steel frame and grounding scheme can reduce upfront costs by $0.0004/W, with lower cleaning-robot capital needs of $0.006/W in China and $0.004/W in the Middle East. In operations, a 100 MW desert plant using manual dry-brush cleaning could halve cleaning frequency, saving $34,000 per year and $0.84 million over 25 years; robot-cleaning Opex over 25 years could be reduced by $0.98 million in northwest China and $0.76 million in the Middle East. Energy yield was reported 4.49% higher than conventional modules at the Mengneng Ulan Buh project. DesertBlue modules earned TÜV Rheinland’s first “desert module” certification, withstanding extreme UV, thermal, sand, abrasion, and cleaning tests. TÜV SÜD confirmed durability through 11,000 robot-cleaning cycles and harsh dust exposure, showing minimal (<1%) power loss and no structural damage. Industry stakeholders said China’s “15th Five-Year Plan” desert base rollout and sand-terrain projects in the Middle East and Africa raise performance requirements as frequent cleaning and ARC-coating wear increase operating costs. JA Solar positioned DesertBlue as a desert-specific solution combining design and certification for these markets. This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

On the evening of 25 August, Sungrow announced that it had held its 18th meeting of the fifth board of directors, during which relevant proposals regarding the proposed issuance of H-shares and listing on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited were reviewed and approved. According to the announcement, the company plans to issue overseas-listed foreign shares (H-shares) and apply for listing on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. This initiative aims to deepen its global strategic footprint, enhance its international brand image, build diversified financing channels, and thereby strengthen its core competitiveness. H-shares are issued for firms based in mainland China and listed on the Hong Kong exchange, regulated by Chinese law but denominated in Hong Kong Dollars, enabling Chinese firms to tap broader sources of financing. As previously reported byESN Premium, since the second half of last year, a wave of companies inChina’s energy storage industry have been seeking listings on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. These include players across the industry chain, such as CATL, Sunwoda, BYD, CALB, REPT Battero, Hithium, and Sigenergy. At the same time, Sungrow also disclosed its 2025 interim report. According to the report, from January to June 2025, Sungrow recorded operating revenue of RMB43.533 billion (US$6.09 billion), a year-on-year increase of 40.34%. Net profit attributable to shareholders of the listed company stood at RMB7.735 billion, a year-on-year increase of 55.97%. Its profitability was remarkable, with both revenue and net profit hitting record highs since the company’s listing. The report highlighted the explosive growth in Sungrow’s energy storage business in the first half of the year, with revenue amounting to RMB17.803 billion, a surge of 127.78% year-on-year. During this period, the company launched the PowerTitan 3.0 AC Smart Storage Platform, with the Plus version offering a capacity of up to 12.5MWh, cementing its position as one of the largest energy storage systems in the industry. In the inverter segment, Sungrow generated revenue of RMB15.327 billion, a year-on-year increase of 17.06%. In the first half of the year, the company launched the world’s first 400kW+ string inverter, the SG465HX, and the world’s first split modular inverter, the 1+X 2.0. Behind the impressive performance, two notable shifts have taken place in Sungrow’s business. First, in terms of revenue share, the company’s largest business segment has shifted from PV inverters to energy storage systems, accounting for 35.21% and 40.89% of its total revenue respectively. At the end of 2024, these proportions were 37.41% and 32.06% respectively. Second, overseas business has grown rapidly. Revenue from overseas markets now surpasses that from the Chinese mainland, accounting for 58.30% and 41.70% of total revenue respectively. As of the end of 2024, these proportions were 46.64% and 53.38% respectively. Market research and analysis firm Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables found that Sungrow was the leading energy storage system integrator by market share during 2024 in Europe and the Middle East and second in North America, the Asia-Pacific region, and overall global rankings. According to the annual system integrator market landscape report issued by Wood Mackenzie a few weeks ago,Sungrow doubled its market share in Europe year-on-year.

The Chinese manufacturer said this morning that Saudi Electricity Company (SEC), the country’s biggest utility, has awarded it a contract to deploy battery energy storage system (BESS) solutions across two sites in the northern provinces of Tabuk and Hail. Hithium is partnered with Saudi-headquartered engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm Alfanar Projects to deliver the projects. The capacity of individual projects was not disclosed; the two’s total energy storage capacity will be 4GWh. Megawatt output was also undisclosed. Hithium did reveal, however, that the project will use the1175Ah lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells that the company began mass producing earlier this yearat its facility in Chongqing, central China. The cells will be integrated into Hithium’s ∞Power 6.25MWh Desert Eagle, a BESS enclosure specially designed to withstand harsh desert conditions. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia targets 50% of its electricity coming from renewable sources by 2030, necessitating 48GWh of energy storage. The contract for Hithium follows Saudi Electricity Company signing a12.5GWh order with rival Chinese maker BYDin February, afterthe successful delivery of the 2.6GWh Bisha BESS project. Hithium launched its desert-specific BESS solution at an event in October last year. The system is designed to be reliable in operation at temperatures from -30°C to 60°C due to multi-layer insulation, which reduces its internal temperature by up to 10°C. Fully sealed components are designed to protect against sandstorms, while automated dust alerts lessen the need for maintenance and the company claims durable components have been selected that are rated for more than 40,000 hours of continuous operation. The Chinese manufacturer also said in launching the product last year that it will build aBESS factory in Saudi Arabia with 5GWh annual production capacity through Hithium MANAT, a joint venture with Saudi engineering solutions company MANAT. The company claims to have made breakthroughs in design and manufacturing techniques that enabled it to make cells three times bigger than the 314Ah cells commonly integrated into large-scale BESS solutions. That appears to put Hithium ahead of its peers in China. Major manufacturers of batteries for energy storage applications exhibiting at this year’s SNEC industry event in May showcased larger-format battery cells, butwhile 500Ah appeared to be a new standard and 600Ah+ cells an outlier pursued by a handful of players, Hithium has the head start on kiloampere-hour cells, which it said can effectively perform long-duration energy storage (LDES) applications.

Discussing asset management on the ‘M&A and Engaging the Investor’ panel discussion, Sheehy of investment advisory firm Pottinger also noted that mergers and acquisitions (M&A) play an “incredibly important role” in the deployment of BESS. “M&A is really important in shifting the profile from a cost of capital, from a risk profile as you move through the development stages and into operations and through the life of the battery,” Sheehy added. Paul Peters, CEO of the New South Wales Energy Security Corporation (ESC), whichlaunched at the start of July, and Alexander Austin, CEO of Infradebt, also participated in the panel discussion. The ESC was established under the Energy Security Corporation Act 2024. According to itsofficial website, the organisation will invest between AU$25 million (US$16.25 million) and AU$150 million per project. It has been armed with an initial funding allocation of AU$1 billion and an investment mandate that focuses on short – to long-duration energy storage (LDES) projects. Peters emphasised the need for longer-duration energy storage in New South Wales to maintain grid reliability amid growing concerns that the state will likelyexperience grid-reliability issues in 2027-28 without intervention. “Of the 14 battery projects in the state today, 11 of them are two hours. That’s not enough duration, so we’re very focused on longer duration, such as four hours, eight hours, and getting some momentum into the market for those to get close, but to get to operation,” Peters added. The state’s ESC will result in an overall expansion of private sector renewable energy investment in New South Wales, similar to how theCommonwealth’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC)has expanded total renewable energy investment across Australia. In addition to these factors, Austin believes that it is not only possible to go 100% merchant with a BESS without input from initiatives such as the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS), which has a revenue floor and cap, but the organisation is already delivering these. “We have done several pure merchant BESS projects. We created a specialist battery debt fund with the unfortunate acronym of ETF: the Energy Transition Fund,” Austin begins. “ETF was created to provide debt finance to predominantly merchant batteries. We do everything from full merchant to 50/50; it’s here. That’s part of what we see as our niche in the market.” Our publisher, Solar Media, will host theEnergy Storage Summit Asia 2025on 7-8 October 2025 in Manila, the Philippines.

NHOA Energy will supply Neoen with the battery energy storage system (BESS) technology for the 10MW/51MWh ‘Broni Battery’ project, in the province of Pavia, Northern Italy. The project has a 15-year Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (or capacity market) contract awarded by transmission system operator (TSO) Terna in the December 2024 auction, for delivery from Q1 2026. The auction cleared at €56,000 (US$65,000) per MW of ‘probability-weighted’ power per year, NHOA toldEnergy-Storage.news,referring to what is more commonly known as a de-rating factor. Four-hour BESS have a 67% de-rating factor, meaning the de-rated or probability-weighted capacity of the Broni project contract is 7MW. The successive auction for 2027 delivery was held in February 2025 and cleared at €47k/MW/year. The business case for grid-scale energy storage in Italy looks set to be driven by the capacity market in the North of Italy and the MACSE scheme (Meccanismo di Approvvigionamento di Capacità di Stoccaggio Elettrico) in the South/Central regions of the country. Both provide 15 years of contracted revenues. The capacity market, where contract holders are obligated to bid in the day-ahead and ancillary services markets, may make up 30-40% of BESS project revenues, according to some estimates. The first MACSE auctions will run at the end of September. Winning projects’ capacity will effectively be handed over to Terna for use in a time-shifting platform serving renewable asset owners, and projects in MACSE will derive up to 80% of their revenues from it, analysts estimate. Together, the two schemes should enable the commissioning by early 2028 of at least 20GWh of BESS capacity in Italy. Terna is targeting 50GWh of new energy storage by 2030. However, one developer-operator weinterviewed recently forESN Premiumreckoned that target might be overly ambitious. BESS will also play in the country’s ancillary service markets, although its future role providing grid-forming services like voltage control and inertia is uncertain following Terna’s self-procurement of substantial synchronous condenser capacity. Though it’s gone through several changes of ownership and name, NHOA was originally founded in Italy in 2005 as Electro Power Systems (EPS), before being acquired by utility and power firm Engie, which then sold it to Taiwan Cement Corporation (TCC),a deal which completed in late 2024.

Благодаря высокой теплоёмкости расплавленная соль способна аккумулировать большое количество тепла в течение дня и сохранять его даже ночью. Затем накопленное тепло передаётся турбинам, которые вырабатывают электроэнергию, пишетEofruPikabu. Эта система обеспечивает энергией и освещением около 80 000 домов, демонстрируя эффективное использование возобновляемых источников энергии. Такой подход позволяет значительно снизить зависимость от ископаемого топлива и уменьшить выбросы парниковых газов, способствуя борьбе с изменением климата. Кроме того, технология аккумулирования тепла в расплавленной соли обеспечивает стабильное и непрерывное энергоснабжение, что является одним из главных преимуществ по сравнению с традиционными солнечными панелями, зависящими от наличия солнечного света. Проект в Дуньхуане служит примером успешной интеграции современных технологий и экологически чистых решений, открывая новые перспективы для развития устойчивой энергетики в регионах с высоким уровнем солнечной инсоляции.

Особое внимание уделяется обеспечению экологической устойчивости, а также повышению экономической эффективности путем реформирования сферы и внедрения инновационных технологий, пишетУзА. Акционерное общество «Узбекнефтегаз» также реализует ряд важных проектов в этом направлении. Вот что рассказал нам руководитель пресс-службы общества Мумин ИБОДОВ: – Государство поставило перед нами задачи по широкому внедрению возобновляемых источников энергии и повышению энергоэффективности. В результате строительства объектов возобновляемой энергии, внедрения современных технологий и энергосберегающего оборудования достигнуты важные результаты в обеспечении надлежащего использования энергетических ресурсов на наших предприятиях. Так, за 7 месяцев текущего года обществом сэкономлено 72,9 миллиона киловатт-часов электроэнергии и 34,48 миллиона кубометров природного газа. Эти показатели составляют 132 и 101,5 процента от намеченного плана. В целях обеспечения выполнения поручений Президента по энергосбережению и внедрению возобновляемых источников энергии в АО «Узбекнефтегаз» реализован ряд проектов. На предприятиях и в офисах установлены устройства компенсации частоты и реактивной мощности, энергосберегающие насосы, компрессоры и современные технологии. Также работают солнечная фотоэлектрическая установка мощностью 29,3 МВт, солнечные водонагреватели и освещение на основе солнечных панелей. Это позволило значительно сократить потребление электроэнергии. В настоящее время на Шуртанском газохимическом комплексе реализуется проект по производству электроэнергии из 48 тысяч кубометров отбросного газа. После выхода проекта на полную мощность комплекс будет вырабатывать 36,8 миллиона киловатт-часов электроэнергии и предотвратит выбросы 14 297 тонн Со2. В Газлийском нефтегазодобывающем управлении строится газопоршневая электростанция мощностью 7 МВт. За счет этого проекта будет вырабатываться 47 миллионов киловатт-часов электроэнергии. Также на предприятиях и в подразделениях системы внедряются модули накопления энергии BESS (Battery Energy Storage System) мощностью 95 МВт или 190 МВт·ч. Безусловно, в результате таких мер будут достигнуты экономия электроэнергии и топливных ресурсов, а также экологическая устойчивость. До конца текущего года планируется сэкономить 98,2 миллиона киловатт-часов электроэнергии и 72 миллиона кубометра природного газа. В заключение следует сказать, что реформы и инвестиционные проекты АО «Узбекнефтегаз» играют важную роль в экономии энергоресурсов и обеспечении экологической устойчивости. Новые технологии и модернизация производства вносят значительный вклад в развитие экономики Узбекистана и охрану окружающей среды. Это один из приоритетных шагов на пути к устойчивому и экологически безопасному будущему Узбекистана.

Традиционные методы неэффективные или дорогие, поэтому отрасль рассматривает возобновляемые источники энергии (ВИЭ), в частности, гидроэнергетику. Газета «Энергетика и промышленность России» разобрали альтернативные варианты энергоснабжения Арктики, пишетСибирский Новостной. Крайний Север богат водными ресурсами: только в Якутии насчитывается 700 тыс. рек, в Красноярском крае – 127 тыс. Их можно использовать для строительства малых ГЭС, которые выгоднее чем крупные объекты. В СССР таких станций было более 7000, но сегодня в России осталось лишь 102. «Из восьми арктических стран семь развивают малые ГЭС. Россия – единственная, кто этого не делает, ссылаясь на сложные климатические условия. Однако в Канаде, где температура опускается до –69°C, малые ГЭС дают 15 тыс. МВт», – отметил глава Национального агентства по энергосбережению и ВИЭ Николай Сафронов. Средний срок окупаемости таких проектов – около 5 лет. Среди перспективных технологий: · резиновые плотины – легко монтируются и демонтируются; · капсульные ГЭС – работают подо льдом, не мешая судоходству. Однако в Арктике малые ГЭС могут функционировать лишь 5–6 месяцев в году, поэтому для их рентабельности необходима господдержка. Строительство крупных АЭС, ГЭС и ТЭЦ в Арктике нерентабельно из-за сложностей с распределением энергии. Выход – локальная генерация, но она требует системной поддержки государства. По мнению руководителя направления по энергетике и ЖКХ Корпорации развития Дальнего Востока (КРДВ) Максима Губанова – «Необходимы льготное финансирование, долгосрочное планирование и эффективные бизнес-модели». Уже запущены пилотные проекты, которые в случае успеха можно масштабировать на другие удаленные территории. Российские компании создают уникальные решения для Арктики: · ГТД АА-2000 – компактный газотурбинный двигатель, работающий даже на угле. Его можно быстро доставить и установить без фундамента; · малые АЭС – саморегулируемые реакторы мощностью до 1 МВт (электричество) и 14 МВт (тепло). Сегодня многие северные населенные пункты зависят от дизельных электростанций (ДЭС), износ которых достигает 70%. Себестоимость энергии в Якутии иногда превышает 1000 руб./кВт·ч. Альтернативой может стать газомоторная генерация. ГМ ТЭЦ в Анадыре производит энергию по 10 руб./кВт·ч, используя местный газ. Однако без модернизации месторождения станция может закрыться уже через 2–3 года.

Здесь может быть запущено до 100 малотоннажных заводов, в ближайшие 5–7 лет — с продукцией, которую покупает Европа уже сегодня: лиоцелл из конопли и льна, биотопливо из рапса и сорго, устойчивое авиационное топливо (SAF). Каждый такой завод — 200 стабильных рабочих мест для специалистов нового поколения, и возможность удержать до 5000 жителей и привлечь ещё до 1000. Это не гипотеза — это структурный ответ на вызовы Великого возвращения. Это новая модель коммуникации с ЕС, и Карабах — идеальная точка входа в эту модель, пишетИгорь Насиров, независимый эксперт, кандидат технических наук, на порталеFirst News Media. В июле 2025 года в Ханкенди прошёл 17-й саммит Организации экономического сотрудничества (ОЭС) — не просто дипломатическое событие, но поворотный момент: Карабах окончательно вышел за рамки зоны восстановления, превратившись в стратегическую платформу евразийской устойчивой индустриализации. Этот вектор не случаен. Карабах обладает пятью из одиннадцати мировых климатических зон и девяти климатических зон Азербайджана, что делает регион уникальным плацдармом для внедрения новых моделей индустрии, циркулярной экономики и общества. Восстановление это не возвращение к довоенному статус-кво, а возможность формирования новой индустриальной логики — низкоуглеродной, мультиотраслевой и инженерно-ориентированной. Стратегическая цель в год «Конституции и Суверенитета» — стабильный и качественный рост населения, рост ВВП и высококвалифицированного трудового потенциала региона. Фокус сдвигается от инфраструктуры к формированию устойчивого демографического и экономического развития. За гражданским строительством следуют налоговые стимулы, поддержка технопарков, локализация переработки, и продвижение производств, ориентированных на внутренний и экспортный рынок. Современная климатическая повестка уже перешла в разряд глобальной политической доктрины и стратегии. В то время как ЕС внедряет замкнутые модели производства, Азербайджан способен сформировать свою систему — через интеграцию биоресурсов и цепочек глубокой переработки. Центральным инструментом этой стратегии в регионе может выступить Вектор Центр-БИО (биоцентричный промышленный кластер), выстроенный на синергии возобновляемых источников энергии (ВИЭ) (Карабах официально объявлензоной«зелёной» энергии), глубокой переработке биоресурсов, водородных технологиях и локальных инженерных решениях. Среди ключевых направлений: волокно, биодизель и биоглицерин, устойчивое авиационное топливо (SAF), эфирные масла, природные смолы, биоэтанол, уксусная кислота, микроводоросли, биокрасители, витамины, кислоты, вакцины и бактериофаги. Благодаря зелёной электроэнергии продукция не только «био», но и углеродно-нейтральная. Одной из опор зелёной индустрии может стать лиоцелл (Lyocell) — биоразлагаемое целлюлозное волокно нового поколения. Он сочетает прочность синтетики с экологичностью натуральных материалов и уже признан ЕС в рамках Sustainable Product Policy Framework. Рост спроса в ЕС – 15-30 % в год. Lyocell способен заменить полиэстер, вискозу и нетканые материалы во множестве отраслей: от текстиля до медицины и упаковки. Лиоцелл идеален для вторичной переработки. Переход к устойчивому производству лиоцелла требует новой сырьевой стратегии, ориентированной на климатическую адаптацию и замкнутые циклы биомассы. Особую ценность представляет сырьё из хлопкового линтера с содержанием целлюлозы до 95%. Однако его дефицит диктуют необходимость создания альтернативной сырьевой базы. Ключевыми культурами выступают лён, конопля, рапс и сорго — мультифункциональные растения, совмещающие масличную и целлюлозную ценность. К ним примыкает Paulownia elongata, быстрорастущее дерево с высоким содержанием целлюлозы энергетической ценностью, признанное IRENA и UNIDO в числе ключевых ресурсов для биоэнергетики и климатоустойчивого земледелия и отлично подходящая для расширения «Парка наследия COP29» на территорию Карабаха. Paulownia является регулируемым инвазивным видом, контролируемым в странах ЕС и США, что требует использованию передовых технологий и применения лучших практик современных агропарков. Выбранные культуры демонстрируют устойчивость к засухам, высокую урожайность на маргинальных почвах и потенциал для глубокой переработки — от биотоплива и упаковки до фармацевтических ингредиентов и биотекстиля. Хеджируют усталость земель и изменения климата. Лён и конопля обладают наилучшими параметрами для производства лиоцелла. Сорго и рапс оптимальны для производства биодизеля, SAF, а также кормов и БАДов. Конопля, несмотря на регуляторные ограничения, при уровне ТГК ≤0.3 % уже исключена из-под действия Конвенции ООН 1961 года и признана UNODC безопасной для промышленного использования. Её включение в пилотные проекты в Азербайджане возможно в рамках обновлённой нормативной базы и уже существующего опыта агропарков, использующих технологии искусственного интеллекта, спутникового мониторинга и интернета вещей, что не только гарантирует максимальный урожай, но и исключает смешивание сортов и превышение ТГК. Формируется новая промышленная карта региона на основе синергии агропромышленного комплекса с глубокой переработкой агропродукции и легкой промышленностью: Развёртывание биоцентричной промышленной архитектуры на базе возобновляемого сырья, распределённых производств и зелёной энергетики позволяет рассматривать Карабах как ядро формирования новой евразийской модели устойчивого развития. Здесь сходятся три стратегические оси: — демографическая устойчивость. Ключевая особенность данной модели — мультифункциональность: биоэкономика становится одновременно экономической, социальной и демографической платформой.Каждый из 100 заводов создаёт по 200 прямых рабочих мест.При условии запуска10 заводов — минимум 2000 новых квалифицированных инженеров и технологовв течение 5-7 лет. По расчетной демографической модели,это позволит поддержать до 50 000 жителей и дополнительно привлечь около 10 000 в регион— за счёт занятости, образования и доступной инфраструктуры. Биоиндустрия формирует каркас новой социальной географии: появляются рабочие места для агрономов, химиков, операторов, биотехнологов, преподавателей и студентов.Формируются университетские кластеры, научные парки, программы стажировки, колледжи и лаборатории. Критическим элементом становится интеграция системы субсидий — как компенсации логистических и энергетических издержек для удалённых производств.Субсидии позволяют выровнять себестоимость с центральными регионами и запустить устойчивое ценообразование на продукцию глубокой переработки, задействовать транспортную инфраструктуру, включая аэропорты. Карабах превращается в ядро формирования нового класса — инженеров устойчивого будущего, ориентированного на синергию с природной средой, интеграцию в глобальные производственные цепочки и освоение ресурсной базы будущего. Обладая пятью из одиннадцати мировых климатических зон и девяти климатических зон Азербайджана, высокопродуктивной агроэкосистемой и доступом к зелёной энергии. На фундаменте пяти национальных приоритетов социально-экономического развития страны: 1. Стабильно растущая конкурентоспособная экономика; 2. Общество, основанное на динамичной, инклюзивной и социальной справедливости; 3. Конкурентоспособный человеческий капитал и пространство для современных инноваций; 4. Великое возвращение на освобожденные территории; 5. Чистая окружающая среда и страна «зеленого роста». Карабах может предложить евразийскую интеграцию принципов циркулярной экономики.Сценарий, при котором Карабах является катализатором трансформаций — локальных по масштабам, но глобальных по значению.Карабах это важный актив в формировании новой модели коммуникации ЕС и Азербайджана — основанной на совместной работе по продвижению биоэкономики, возобновляемых источников энергии, водорода и углерод-нейтральных производств.

По его словам, модернизация транспортной и энергетической инфраструктуры — основа для повышения качества жизни в горных регионах, пишет порталБугин.Инфо. Кожошев подчеркнул, что Кыргызстан, благодаря уникальному горному ландшафту и богатым природным ресурсам, демонстрирует впечатляющую экономическую динамику. В 2024 году ВВП страны вырос на 9%, что стало рекордным показателем. Однако горные территории сталкиваются с вызовами: изолированность, климатические риски и внутренняя миграция требуют целенаправленной государственной политики. Ключевыми инициативами министр назвал строительство железных дорог Китай — Кыргызстан — Узбекистан и Балыкчи — Кочкор — Макмал, а также развитие авиасообщения с отдаленными регионами. Эти проекты призваны сократить транспортную изоляцию и стимулировать экономический рост. Особое внимание Кожошев уделил энергетической независимости. Развитие возобновляемых источников энергии и использование гидроэнергетического потенциала позволят обеспечить доступ к электроэнергии в труднодоступных горных районах, снизив зависимость от внешних поставок. «Горные регионы стран ЕАЭС обладают огромным потенциалом, но его реализация требует современных решений и международного сотрудничества», — отметил министр. Он призвал к совместным усилиям для создания устойчивой инфраструктуры, которая обеспечит экономический рост и экологическую стабильность. Кожошев также подчеркнул важность глобального диалога для обмена опытом и привлечения инвестиций в горные регионы. Развитие транспортных коридоров и зеленой энергетики не только повысит уровень жизни, но и укрепит позиции ЕАЭС на мировой арене. Конференция в Бишкеке стала площадкой для обсуждения этих идей, объединив экспертов и политиков для поиска решений, которые сделают горные территории Евразии драйверами устойчивого будущего.

Компания заключила долгосрочную сделку с индийской государственной корпорацией Indian Oil (IOC), по которой будет поставлять ей СПГ на протяжении 15 лет. Согласно условиям соглашения, ADNOC будет ежегодно поставлять в Индию 1 млн тонн топлива. Основной объем поставок пойдет со строящегося завода в Рувайсе. Кроме того, стороны заключили отдельную сделку на поставку еще 1,2 млн тонн СПГ в год с терминала на острове Дас. Благодаря этим контрактам к 2029 году Indian Oil станет самым крупным покупателем СПГ у ADNOC. Для самой эмиратской компании это часть стратегии по поиску надежных долгосрочных клиентов для своих новых мощностей. Для Индии же эти поставки — шаг к цели по увеличению доли газа в национальной энергетике. Новый завод в Рувайсе, как ожидается, заработает в 2028 году и более чем вдвое увеличит текущие мощности ADNOC по производству СПГ — до 15 млн т/г. Компания уже обеспечила сбыт для большей части будущего газа, заключив долгосрочные контракты на 8 млн тонн из 9,6 млн тонн планируемого объема. Также стало известно, что дочерняя компания ADNOC Gas Plc планирует во второй половине 2028 года выкупить 60% доли в проекте Ruwais у своей материнской компании. «НиК» напоминает, что вчера официальный Нью-Дели заявил, что дорогой газ странабудет использоватьдля электрогенерации только в пиковые месяцы — май и июнь, а остальное время обойдется углем и, в перспективе, ВИЭ. IOC вообще-то государственная компания, но, видимо, может позволить себе газовую генерацию и использование газа в иных целях не только на пике. © Все права защищены.

Это решение из соображений защиты окружающей среды: нефтедобыча ведет к вырубке тропических лесов и загрязнению Амазонки, главной реки Южной Америки, а также Мирового океана. Оно принято на фоне стремления Эквадора и Перу расширить буровые работы в Амазонии. Эквадор планирует выставить на аукцион более 2 млн гектаров в рамках «Южного нефтяного раунда», включая участки на отдалённых территориях коренных народов — площадь примерно равна площади штата Нью-Джерси. «НиК»: Половина всей нефти, добытой в лесах Амазонии, перерабатывается в Калифорнии.

Все дело в деньгах: такой способ производства энергии в стране считают слишком дорогим. Цены на газ взлетели до $12 за 1 млн БТЕ в 2022 году, в последние два года и вовсе колебались между $8 и $18. Из-за этого доля газа в энергобалансе страны упала вдвое: с 3% в 2020 году до примерно 1,5% сегодня. Гораздо дешевле получать электричество другими способами. Основой энергетики Индии по-прежнему остается уголь, на который приходится целых 75% всего энергобаланса страны. Параллельно Нью-Дели активно развивает возобновляемые источники энергии. Представители Центрального управления электроэнергетики рассказали, что еще в мае правительство Индии разработало специальный стодневный план, чтобы можно было быстро задействовать газовые станции, если спрос на электричество вдруг резко подскочит. Этот план включает контракты, которые покроют стартовые расходы и скачки цен на газ. Кроме того, правительство пересмотрело список доступных газовых электростанций. Их суммарная мощность была снижена с 25 ГВт до 20 ГВт, т. к. некоторые из них простаивали несколько лет из-за высокой стоимости газа и пришли в негодность. Из оставшихся мощностей в прошлом году в пиковые дни использовали только 13-14 ГВт. В этом году аномально сильные дожди и замедление темпов экономики привели к тому, что люди реже пользовались кондиционерами и спрос на электричество был ниже ожидаемого. Пиковое потребление составило 242 ГВт против прогнозируемых 270 ГВт. Поэтому необходимость задействовать дорогой газ пока не возникла. © Все права защищены.

При контакте с водой эти микроканалы запускают гидровольтаический эффект — движение ионов под действием испарения и капиллярных сил, что приводит к генерации электрического тока. Устройство из скорлупы грецкого ореха показало стабильное напряжение более 600 мВ и плотность мощности свыше 5,9 мкВт/см², работающую на протяжении недели. После специальной обработки производительность выросла: напряжение достигло 1,21 В, а максимальная плотность тока — 347,2 μА/см², что превышает показатели большинства органических и неорганических аналогов. Две такие установки, соединенные вместе, смогли питать LCD-калькулятор без дополнительных преобразователей. По словам авторов, технология демонстрирует, как аграрные отходы — обычная ореховая скорлупа — могут стать доступным и экологичным источником энергии для питания небольших электронных устройств. В перспективе такие генераторы смогут использовать влагу, дождевую воду или даже морскую воду, открывая новые возможности для развития устойчивой энергетики.

Инвестиции в новые проекты возобновляемой энергетики достигли рекордных 386 млрд долларов США в первой половине текущего года, что на 10% больше, чем в предыдущем году. Однако авторы отмечают, что инвестиции в крупномасштабные солнечные электростанции и наземную ветроэнергетику сократились. Общий рост был достигнут благодаря офшорной ветроэнергетике, инвестиции в которую существенно возросли. BNEF отмечает, что инвестиции в солнечные фотоэлектрические станции крупного масштаба (utility scale) пострадали особенно сильно, упав на 19% по сравнению с первой половиной 2024 года. На рынках, где наблюдалось наибольшее снижение инвестиций в годовом исчислении, включая материковый Китай, Испанию, Грецию и Бразилию, отмечался рост вынужденных потерь, а также участились случаи отрицательных цен на электроэнергию, что свидетельствует о том, что опасения инвесторов по поводу доходов имеют первостепенное значение. Активность инвесторов в секторе солнечной энергетики была выше на рынках с эффективно структурированными государственными тендерами или высоким корпоративным спросом на электроэнергию. Инвестиции в малые солнечные электростанции компенсировали сокращение финансирования более крупных проектов, поскольку малые объекты можно быстро развернуть и запустить до существенных изменений в политике, влияющих на доходы или окупаемость. Например, в материковом Китае инвестиции в малые солнечные электростанции почти удвоились в годовом исчислении. «Инвесторы и разработчики проектов в области возобновляемой энергетики пересматривают распределение капитала и вкладывают средства в проекты с наибольшей доходностью», — отметила Мередит Аннекс, руководитель отдела чистой энергии в BloombergNEF. Из всех основных регионов в США наблюдалось наибольшее падение новых инвестиций в возобновляемую энергетику в первой половине 2025 года: объём утвержденных финансовых вложений сократился до 20,5 млрд долларов (на 36%) по сравнению со второй половиной 2024 года. Это отражает реакцию отрасли на выборы в США 2024 года: энергетики поспешили начать строительство в конце прошлого года, чтобы получить доступ к налоговым льготам, а затем замедлили темпы роста в первой половине нынешнего года из-за ухудшения политической ситуации, особенно в сфере ветроэнергетики, и растущей неопределённости в отношении тарифов. «Рынки с механизмами, гарантирующими доходы сохранили динамику инвестиций в возобновляемую энергетику», — отмечает Аннекс. «В то время как проекты на рынках, где отмечается неопределенность в части доходов, переживают циклы подъемов и спадов». В странах ЕС-27 инвестиции в первой половине 2025 года выросли почти на 30 млрд долларов США, или на 63%, по сравнению со второй половиной 2024 года. Эти данные подтверждают идею, что компании перераспределяют капитал из США в Европу, особенно в офшорную ветроэнергетику, где некоторые инвесторы переориентировались на объекты в Северном море, выйдя их американских проектов. В Юго-Восточной Азии инвестиции выросли на 7% по сравнению со второй половиной 2024 года. Материковый Китай остался крупнейшим рынком с долей в 44% мировых новых инвестиций в первой половине 2025 года.

Саудовская Аравия строит объекты солнечной и ветровой энергетикив гигантских масштабах. В июне прошлого годасообщалось, что королевство будет ежегодно проводить конкурсные отборы проектов ВИЭ объемом 20 ГВт и намерено увеличить мощности возобновляемой энергетики до 100-130 ГВт к 2030 году. Правительство страны планирует довести долю ВИЭ в выработке электроэнергии до 50% к 2030 году. Для поддержки интеграции переменной генерации на основе солнца и ветра в стране реализуются крупномасштабные проекты по накоплению энергии. В октябре прошлого года Hithium и саудовская MANATобъявилио создании совместного предприятия (СП), целью которого является создание в Саудовской Аравии мощностей по производству аккумуляторных систем накопления энергии с планируемой годовой мощностью 5 ГВт*ч. В феврале текущего года китайская BYDсообщилао подписании «крупнейшего в мире контракта» с саудовской энергетической компанией Saudi Electricity Company на реализацию проекта по хранению энергии ёмкостью 12,5 ГВт*ч. Ранее BYD поставила свои системы накопления энергии (СНЭ) длягигантского объектамощностью 500 МВт / ёмкостью 2000 МВт*ч, который в январе 2025 года введен в эксплуатацию в провинции Асир в Саудовской Аравии. Ваша поддержка очень важна для существования и развития RenEn, ведущего русскоязычного Интернет-сайта в области «новой энергетики». Помогите, чем можете, пожалуйста.
