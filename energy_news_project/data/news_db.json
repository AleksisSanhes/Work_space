      "full_text": "Canada is in the middle of two crises that are converging in uncomfortable ways. On one side, housing supply has failed to keep up with demand for decades. Affordability is slipping out of reach for many households, and the workforce that builds homes is aging and stretched thin. On the other side, buildings and construction remain a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Much of the public discussion has focused on operational energy, but a third of the climate problem in this sector is tied up in embodied carbon from materials like cement and steel. Those emissions are locked in before a single family or tenant ever moves into a unit. What is becoming clear is that there is one lever that can address both issues at once. Cross laminated timber, or CLT, combined with modular manufacturing, can industrialize housing while cutting embodied emissions at scale. The diagnosis — as always, I’m leveraging Rumelt’s kernel of good strategy — is straightforward. Canada’s annual housing completions hover around 240,000 to 270,000 units, while population growth points to the need for about 500,000 per year to stabilize affordability. Traditional site built construction is not delivering those numbers, and throwing more labor at the problem is not realistic given the shortages in skilled trades. At the same time, we continue to pour concrete and erect steel, cementing millions of tons of emissions in the process. These materials have a role in infrastructure, but they are overused in mid rise residential construction where other options are available. Housing delivery is slow, labor is scarce, and embodied carbon is ignored. That combination is unsustainable. The guiding policy is to treat housing like advanced manufacturing. Instead of bespoke site work, we should think of apartments and mid rise condos the way we think of cars or appliances. They can be produced in factories, standardized for safety and efficiency, and shipped as panels or modules to be assembled quickly. CLT is the core material that makes this possible. It is strong, light, renewable, and produced from trees that sequester carbon as they grow. Modular construction methods allow for site preparation and factory production to occur in parallel, compressing schedules by 30 to 50%. Taken together, CLT and modular turn the delivery of housing from a cottage industry into an industrial system. Mark Carney’s Build Canada Homes plan points in exactly this direction. It targets 500,000 homes per year, financed with low cost loans and equity for prefab builders, and supported by pattern book designs that can be stamped out repeatedly across sites. The Transition Accelerator’s mass timber roadmap sets capacity goals through 2030 and 2035 that align with this vision, calling for a million cubic meters of production by 2030 and doubling that five years later. The actions are not complicated, but they require commitment. Government must act as an anchor customer by issuing multi year offtake contracts for modular CLT housing. That gives factories the volume they need to operate efficiently and pay down capital investments. Pattern books of pre approved designs must be created so that every project does not start with a blank sheet of paper. Public and private finance has to flow into the build out of 10 to 12 large regional factories, each capable of producing panels and modules at the scale required. Finally, procurement rules must reward low carbon materials. If federal and provincial governments mandate embodied carbon targets for housing, CLT will be advantaged over concrete and steel, and private developers will follow suit. The data illustrates the point. A cubic meter of CLT stores roughly a ton of CO2 from the atmosphere, while producing it emits around 120 kilograms of CO2 from harvesting, drying, adhesives, and transport. That means net storage rather than net emissions. Replacing concrete and steel with CLT in mid rise apartments can cut embodied carbon by 15 to 40% depending on the design. Build times are compressed as well. A concrete structure often takes weeks per floor as forms are set, poured, and cured. A mass timber floor can be craned into place in days. Brock Commons, the 18 storey student residence at UBC, was built in less than ten weeks for the structural portion, a pace impossible with concrete. My long term forecasts for cement and steel demand through 2100 show both materials peaking much earlier than most mainstream models anticipate and then tapering steadily for the rest of the century. The reason is not a collapse of construction but a shift in what we build with. As infrastructure build outs in China and other emerging economies slow, and as advanced economies move into maintenance rather than expansion, the structural drivers of cement and steel demand weaken. At the same time, substitution pressures grow stronger. Cross laminated timber and other mass timber products are a central lever here. Every mid rise apartment or office built in CLT instead of reinforced concrete avoids both the cement in the slabs and the rebar that would have reinforced them. That substitution compounds over decades. In my projection curves, cement demand flattens and then declines to about half of today’s levels by 2100, while steel demand bends downward as electric arc furnaces dominate a smaller total market. CLT is not the only factor, but it is one of the most powerful and immediate ways to cut into the trajectory of the two most carbon intensive building materials we use. Canada’s opportunity is twofold. Domestically, meeting the 500,000 homes per year target is only possible if housing is industrialized with mass timber and modular methods. Internationally, demand for CLT is rising quickly in the United States, Europe, and Asia, and Canada has the forest resource and technical expertise to capture a large share of that market. The risks are also clear. If we fail to build factories, if insurance and code barriers remain unresolved, or if competitors move faster, Canada could miss the window. This moment in time will not repeat itself. Other countries are already scaling their mass timber industries. The argument for CLT and modular as Canada’s fastest lever is not speculative. It is grounded in the numbers on housing starts, embodied emissions, and build time compression. It is reinforced by policy commitments from the federal government and by industry roadmaps that chart the path to scale. The task now is to align policy, finance, and industry action so that Canada moves from demonstrations and pilot projects to a mainstream manufacturing system for housing. If we succeed, we will ease the housing crisis, cut embodied carbon, and establish a new advanced manufacturing sector that can compete globally. This series of articles will explore in depth how that transformation can be achieved, from Carney’s housing initiative to export strategy, from steel and cement demand shifts to decarbonizing the forestry supply chain, and from Indigenous led stewardship to investor economics.

      "full_text": "The alleged US government is hellbent on destroying renewable energy as a way of expanding the use of fossil fuels. The administration, led by true believers likeChris Wright, the current Energy Secretary, and Doug Burgum, the current Interior Secretary, likes to pooh pooh climate change. Recently, Wright acknowledged that climate change is happening, but claimed it is far from being the most serious challenge facing the United States. There are lots of other challenges — such as relegating Black and Brown people to their proper places and passing new Jim Crow laws to keep them there. Perhaps it is time to flip the script. Instead of yammering on about melting ice caps and starving polar bears — concepts that many people seem to have difficulty wrapping their heads around — maybe it is time to put the spotlight on the harm fossil fuels do to people. Here’s a handy example. Astudy published this weekin the journalScience Advancesclaims that extracting, transporting, refining, distributing, and burning fossil fuels causes at least NINETY THOUSAND premature deaths in the US every year. Why is that figure capitalized? Because if we just say “90,000,” there would be a tendency to skip right over the number and not internalize what it is telling us. [Editor’s note: As soon as I read it in all caps, I thought, “This is so much more impactful reading it like this. How brilliant of Steve!” —Zach] On September 11, 2001, a little over 3,000 people died in the attack on the Twin Towers. America went into a paroxysm of unfocused rage that cost the US some $3 trillion and saw more than 100,000 Iraqis killed — none of whom had the slightest connection to the horror of 9/11. Every year, more than 40,000 Americans die in automobile accidents. Even someone with my limited math skills knows that is more than the number of people who died on 9/11, but Americans seem to be impervious to the carnage taking place on the roads. They just buy bigger and heavier vehicles, plant a religious icon on the dashboard, and hope for the best. Now we know, thanks to this research, that 90,000 Americans — 20 times the number of deaths on September 11, 2001 — go to an early grave because of fossil fuel pollution every year. Perhaps if we seized on that information and publicized it aggressively, it would get people to pay attention to the carnage inflicted by our ongoing love affair with fossil fuels. The current climate change message is not getting through to quite a few people. Perhaps a change in tactics is in order? Here is the abstract to this groundbreaking research: The United States has one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries, yet the health impacts and inequities from pollutants produced along the oil and gas life cycle remain poorly characterized. Here, we model the contribution of major life cycle stages (upstream, midstream, downstream, and end-use) to air pollution and estimate the associated chronic health outcomes and racial-ethnic disparities across the contiguous US in 2017. We estimate life cycle annual burdens of 91,000 premature deaths attributable to fine particles, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. The research finds there are 10,350 pre-term births attributable to fine particulate pollution, 216,000 incidences of childhood-onset asthma cases linked to nitrogen oxide emissions (which have been characterized as subjecting human lungs to sunburn-like conditions), and 1,610 lifetime cancers attributable to hazardous air pollutants. It clearly illustrates that the burden of fossil fuel pollution falls primarily on non-whites. “Racial-ethnic minorities experience the greatest disparities in exposure and health burdens across almost all life cycle stages. The greatest absolute disparities occur for Black and Asian populations from PM2.5 and ozone, and the Asian population from NO2 and HAPs. Relative inequities are most extreme from downstream activities, especially in Louisiana and Texas.” The researchers at University College London and the Stockholm Environment Institute are the first to examine the health impacts and unequal health burdens caused by every stage of the oil and gas supply chain, from exploration to end use. “We’ve long known that these communities are exposed to such levels of inequitable exposure as well as health burden,” Karn Vohra, a postdoctoral research fellow in geography at University College London, toldThe Guardian. “We were able to just put numbers to what that looks like.” Their findings show that Indigenous and Hispanic populations are most affected by pollution from exploration, extraction, transportation, and storage; Black and Asian populations are most affected by emissions from processing, refining, manufacturing, distribution, and usage. The clearest example for that last finding is the people inSouth Memphiswho are breathing the detritus issuing from several portable methane generators powering xAI’s data center located in a former Electrolux factory. That neighborhood is predominantly Black. “What makes the study so valuable is how it dissects health impacts across the whole life cycle of oil and gas – from where it comes out of the ground to where it is combusted,” said Timothy Donaghy. He is the research director for Greenpeace USA and author of previous research on the racially uneven burdens of fossil fuel pollution. “As many studies have found before, these health burdens are not shared equally — a prime example of fossil fuel racism in action.” “What we found was striking. One in five preterm births and adult deaths are linked tofine particulate pollutionfrom oil and gas,” lead author Karn Vohra, formerly of the University College of London, toldThe Hill. “Even more concerning is that nearly 90 percent of new childhood asthma cases tied to nitrogen dioxide pollution were from this sector,” added Vohra, who is now at the University of Birmingham. Downstream effects have brought particularly dire health issues to Black communities in southern Louisiana — an area known as “Cancer Alley” — and in eastern Texas, the researchers found. The current administration gets apoplectic at the mention of diversity, equality, and inclusion policies, but the bald truth is that such areas have traditionally been “no go” zones for banks and other lenders, a practice known as redlining that has been in use since the 1930s. It has denied Black and other disadvantaged communities access to the capital needed to move away from industrial hot spots or high-traffic roadways. In addition, those communities lack the political power to oppose plans to add more oil, gas, and chemical operations in their neighborhoods. “These communities are already aware of this unjust exposure and the disproportionately large health burdens they experience,” senior author Eloise Marais, a geography professor at the University College of London, said in a statement reported byThe Hill. “Our study puts science-backed numbers on just how large these unfair exposures and health outcomes are,” she added. The data used for the study was collected in 2017, the most recent year for which a complete dataset is available. Because of the passage of time, the researchers stressed that their estimates are likely conservative. US oil and gas production has increased by 40 percent and consumption has risen by 8 percent since then. “Although our health burden results are overall conservative, these provide a foundation for future studies that could further refine quantification of disparities to support civil, community, andregulatory action,” they said. Eloise Marais toldThe Guardianshe hoped the study was “picked up by the kinds of community leaders and advocacy groups that are pushing for exposure to cleaner air. If there was a move away from reliance on oil and gas, we would experience the climate change benefits 50, 100, 200 years from today because the greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere so long, but communities would experience the health benefits immediately.” Reason enough to change the conversation. People have a hard time with abstract thinking, but how difficult is it to comprehend that 90 percent of new childhood asthma cases are linked to nitrogen dioxide pollution from oil and gas operations? Regardless of political orientation, most people will be shocked by that statistic, as well they should be. Forget about starving polar bears;let’s stop damaging the lungs of our children. How hard would it be to get that message across? Steve writes about the interface between technology and sustainability from his home in Florida or anywhere else The Force may lead him. He is proud to be \"woke\" and embraces the wisdom of Socrates , who said \"The secret to change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old but on building the new.\" He also believes that weak leaders push everyone else down while strong leaders lift everyone else up.

      "full_text": "Last Updated on:23rd August 2025, 10:54 am Among all the lies and dissimulations vomiting out of the clown car that used to be known as the US government, it’s hard to stand out from the crowd. But, somehow Agriculture Secretary Brooke L. Rollins found a way. Last week she declared that banishing solar panels from two USDA loan programs will help save our vanishing farmlands. Farmland is disappearing faster than you can shake a stick at it, to be sure. Only … well … nope, solar panels are not the problem, not by a long shot. The numbers don’t lie. The US does indeed have a vanishing farmland problem. However, that’s not a solar panel problem. It’s an urban and suburban sprawl issue that has been swallowing up our nation’s agrarian past in a steady march for decade upon decade, far predating the solar industry of today. Anyone traveling the highways and byways of rural America for an extended period of time has witnessed the trend into the 21st century, with rows of crops replaced by rows of tract homes, warehouses, corporate campuses, and shopping malls. Solar panels, not so much. Take Tennessee, for example, where Rollins staged a press event to publicize her new directive. Farm conservationists list the state among those most at risk of losing land. However, the main culprit by far is real estate development, not solar panels. Nevertheless, in a press release explaining the new loan restrictions on wind turbines and solar panels, USDA stated: “Within the last 30 years, Tennessee alone has lost over 1.2 million acres of farmland and is expected to lose 2 million acres by 2027.” Wow, that’s a lot of farmland. And somehow this is connected to the loan restrictions for wind turbines and solar panels, right? Yes, that’s right, according to the USDA. “This problem is not just in Tennessee, since 2012, solar panels on farmland nationwide have increased by nearly 50%. That is why the Department is taking action,” the USDA continued in the next breath. Say what now? A 50% increase sounds pretty alarming, ermigod! Call out the National Guard! Round up the usual suspects! Two if by sea! The solar panels are coming! “Our prime farmland should not be wasted and replaced with green new deal subsidized solar panels. It has been disheartening to see our beautiful farmland displaced by solar projects, especially in rural areas that have strong agricultural heritage,” Rollins emphasized. Oh, Brooke, Brooke, Brooke. Where to begin with this? Let’s start with the numbers. As any school child knows, a 50% increase over practically nothing is still practically nothing. The real question is how much is practically nothing, and researchers at the University of Tennessee have the answers. They crunched the numbers in their state a couple of years ago and found that the total acreage taken up by utility-scale solar arrays, both in operation and under contract as of 2023, would take up only0.137% of farmland in the state, requiring somewhere in the range of just about 8,200–14,700 acres to produce a total of 1.474 gigawatts of solar energy. So much for the situation as of 2023. The researchers also took a look ahead to the coming years. They based their calculations on the rather ambitious goalpost of an additional 10 gigawatts of utility-scale solar energy set by the Tennessee Valley Authority. The TVA supplies electricity across six other states in addition to Tennessee. However, for the sake of argument, the research team based their calculation on all 10 gigawatts being located within Tennessee. The result? Still next to nothing. For an extra 10 gigawatts of clean energy from the sun, the state would have to give up another 0.52% to 0.93% of its farmland, taking into account new, more efficient solar panels that require less space to produce more energy than those installed in previous years. So, what happened to the rest of those 1.2 million acres that Rollins is so concerned about, to say nothing of the additional acres she expects Tennessee to lose over the coming years? Again, the answer is staring anyone in the face who spends any time at all driving around rural America for any amount of time. “From 1997 to 2017, Tennessee’s land in farms decreased from 11.99 million acres to 10.87 million acres, a reduction of 1.11 million acres or about 9% of Tennessee’s farmland,” the University of Tennessee researchers observed. Sure, go ahead and blame the US solar industry for the loss of 1.11 million acres of farmland in just 20 years, because solar developers were so very, very busy papering over the farms of Tennessee with solar panels from 1997 to 2017 — except, not. As of midway through last year, the state barely had600 megawatts of installed solar capacityunder its belt, including rooftop solar panels and other non-farm installations. The conservation organizationAmerican Farmland Trusthas also been tracking the vanishing farmland trend. In 2020, they issued a state-by-state report in which they listed Tennessee as the 4th-most threatened state in the US due to the loss of agricultural land topoorly planned real estate development(emphasis added). The urban sprawl visible from highways is just part of the problem. AFT analyzed 660,000 acres of agricultural land lost in Tennessee between 2001 and 2016. Approximately 78% was replaced or restricted by LDR (low density residential) development. Aside from the direct loss of farmland, AFT noted that the encroachment of both conventional sprawl and low density development drives up nearby land prices. Retiring farmers in those areas are more likely to sell their land to non-farmers who can afford to pay more. “This means that new and beginning farmers have a hard time finding land, threatening the very future of agriculture,” AFT emphasized. The real estate-related bleeding continues to this day, with Rutherford County among the hotspots in Tennessee where local land use planners are facinga torrent of oppositionfrom “home builders, real estate professionals and developers.” If the planners do manage to save some farms, it’s a day late and a dollar short. Rutherford County lost22,044 acres of farmlandbetween 2014 and 2023. Like her boss in the Oval Office, Rollins lives in alternative reality where actual problems don’t exist, and neither do their solutions. How else to explain the misdirection on solar panels? “Subsidized solar farms have made it more difficult for farmers to access farmland by making it more expensive and less available,” Rollins asserted last week, blithely ignoring every fact and figure about real estate sprawl and population growth. As if the misdirection on solar panels and real estate was not enough, Rollins and her coterie of state officials at last week’s event also conflated small-scale solar arrays with the kind ofutility-scale solar developmentthat anti-solar foes love to complain about. At the very tail end of a very long press release, USDA finally cut to the chase and named the two loan programs in question: the Rural Development Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan Program and the Rural Development Rural Energy for America Program Guaranteed Loan Program. Restricting solar panels from these two programs won’t stop farmers from leasing their land to solar developers for utility-scale solar power plants. Government solar loans and private solar leases are two entirely different and separate transactions. Instead, Rollins has only made it more difficult for farmers to afford the up-front cost of small solar arrays for their own use, on a scale consistent with the barns, sheds, silos and heavy machinery that characterize the agricultural operation of today. If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Better yet,find your representativesin Congress and let them know what you think.

      "full_text": "Last Updated on:23rd August 2025, 01:20 am Australia leads the world in household rooftop solar installations. Over 4 million households have solar panels. In the last 20 years, installations have become bigger and cheaper. My solar array was only 1.9 kWh and cost about AU$6000. For much less, you can now get an array 3 times the size. However, at the same time as arrays have gotten bigger and cheaper, the feed-in tariff (FIT) for solar power has become miniscule. Whereas two decades ago the FIT was around 50¢ a kWh, now you are lucky to get 8¢. What to do with all that power in the middle of the day? The answer is a home battery. Prices on these have fallen, and there has been an increasing number of solar panels + batteries installed — but not nearly as fast as necessary to create high demand. The Australian federal government offers itsCheaper Home Batteriessubsidy. 30% off — what a bargain! AU$2.3 billion is on offer to subsidize the installation of small-scale battery systems (5 kWh–100 kWh) for households, businesses, and community organisations. Come and get it! And have they ever. There have been 11,500 applications for the scheme in its first 3 weeks of operation. No wonder Tesla is sending me an email every second day advertising the Powerwall. Sadly, I bought a home battery several years ago and paid twice the price for out-of-date tech. The subsidy will be reviewed at least annually and “will gradually decrease until 2030, in line with reducing battery prices.” As it should. Many households with an existing solar array are putting in batteries. According to theMelbourne Age, small-scale battery systems equivalent to South Australia’s Tesla Big Battery are being added to the grid every 8.7 days. The scheme has been in operation for about 2 months now, with Australians installing 15 MWh worth of batteries a day. A thousand batteries a day! This is five times the average in 2024. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) had predicted that this would not have been achieved even by 2035. Once again, the market is showing up professional crystal ball gazers. Is this a second revolution in home electricity? The government expects that participating households, businesses, and community organisations will be able to “reduce electricity bills by making the most of cheap and clean solar power by storing it for when it is needed.” Not only will Australians be able to use solar to power their homes during peak hours, they may even have some excess to sell back onto the grid when the prices are high. Some are predicting a return on investment in about four years. Does this mean the end of thesolar duck, or at least reduction of the solar duck? It should mean that there will be much less need for expensive gas (methane) turbines in the evening peak. Tristan Edis, director ofGreen Energy Markets,makes this salient point: “You don’t need swarms of lawyers, merchant bankers, accountants, environmental planning, people, community consultation, all the things that go into building large-scale renewables. You don’t need any approvals. You don’t need any engineers; you just need your local sparky.” At the current rate of installation, within five years, Tristan hypotheses’ that there would be 10,000MW of battery capacity installed. “That’s a big deal when you think we have 20,000MW of coal capacity [in Australia],” he adds.“[D]emand for batteries has gone nuts.” The Australian government is reviewing its emission reduction targets out to 2035. The massive uptake of home batteries and the implications it has for the grid mean that these targets could be more “ambitious.” “With existing state and territory action expected to deliver emissions cuts of between 66 per cent and 71 per cent by 2035, these findings show the Albanese government should be striving for a science-aligned target of 80 per cent [reductions] by 2035,” Australian Conservation Foundation CEO Kelly O’Shanassy said. The managing director of solar consultancy SunWiz, Warwick Johnston, said that prior to the Cheaper Home Batteries scheme, four rooftop solar arrays were being installed for each battery. Now it is one for one. The Clean Energy Regulator data show that the majority of installations (40%) are in New South Wales. Queensland has 20%, South Australia 17%, and Victoria 12%. Homeowners in NSW can also claim an extra subsidy if they connect to a virtual power plant (VPP). What about encouraging all applicants for the subsidy to be part of a VPP? That would make sense.Looks like it’s covered…. “To qualify for the battery rebate, an on-grid battery system — including its inverter — must have the technical capability to participate in a VPP, giving the consumer the option to join a VPP either at installation or in the future … consumers who choose to participate will need an ongoing internet connection. Depending on the inverter model and site conditions, additional hardware or software and permissions for site controllers to access multiple battery systems may be required, and battery retailers must inform consumers about any such requirements.” Many of my Facebook friends are installing the maximum numbers of Powerwalls allowable. I hope to bring you their stories in future articles. Like many others, they are hungry for solutions to high energy costs, and maybe they will make a little hay while the sun shines. And you never know when the next flood will come and wash away the power lines, or the next fire will burn the power poles down, orthe next cyclone will blow down the high-tension towers. This is Australia, and we are in the middle of the climate crisis.It never hurts to have a battery backup. Now, hopefully the next penny will drop. If my home battery saves me money (and doesn’t burst into flames), then it is just possible that an electric car will save me more money and will also not be flammable. After all, it is generally the same chemistry. I am hoping that this surge in home battery installations will reduce the FUD around electric vehicles and bring about a surge in the numbers of EVs on the road. Watching this massive uptake, I am wondering if it is only the price point that matters? For many Australians, the future is now more affordable and more electric.

      "full_text": "Engineered mineral hydrogen is an elegant idea. Water reacts with iron rich magnesium and iron rich, silica poor igneous rock — ultramafic — from Earth’s mantle rocks to release hydrogen, and with the right chemistry and temperature you can raise reaction rates and collect a clean product. In the lab and in models this pathway looks promising. In the field it asks for the same muscles that shale, tight gas and enhanced geothermal developed over years. You need reliable drilling, completions, stimulation, reservoir monitoring and production operations. You also need an offtaker next door that wants steady molecules for decades. That is where the real world starts to pinch. Just as withmicrobial hydrogen underground technologyI looked at recently, what works in the lab starts to look like nonsense in the field. The geology is not where the rigs and frac spreads live. The densest service capacity in North America sits over the Permian, Eagle Ford and other shale basins. Ultramafic belts are common on maps but not in those corridors. Serpentinites — hydrated ultramafic rocks made mostly of chrysotile, lizardite, and antigorite — and ophiolites — slices of oceanic crust and upper mantle thrust onto land by tectonics —show up along the California Coast Ranges, parts of the Appalachians, pieces of the Midwest and scattered blocks in the Intermountain West. There are small overlaps in places like Four Corners or parts of Kansas and Michigan, but the center of gravity for people, pumps and suppliers is hundreds to thousands of kilometers away from many of the most prospective rocks. That distance adds cost, schedule risk and learning friction. It also increases the chance that crews cycle in and out rather than staying long enough to build a stable craft for this very specific job. Offtakers are not where the rocks are either. Methanol capacity in the United States clusters on the Gulf Coast because gas is cheap, pipelines are thick and ports are close. Ammonia looks similar, with a big Louisiana footprint and a secondary band in the Plains and Midwest to serve fertilizer demand. A world scale ammonia plant needs on the order of 176,000 tons of hydrogen per year, and a world scale methanol plant needs on the order of 200,000 tons per year. If your hydrogen source sits beside those plants you can move gas a few kilometers to a header, purify it and feed the process. If the source sits a long way from the fence line you have built a second business that must move a low density gas across long distances, or you must convert it to another carrier. That erodes the simple “field to flange” narrative that makes engineered mineral hydrogen look tidy on paper. The physics and chemistry set tight conditions that must be met and kept. Hydrogen generation is strongest when water reacts with ferrous iron to become magnetite, releasing hydrogen, which works best at a few hundred degrees Celsius. If the rock is cooler, reaction rates drop. If rust-like coatings cover the reactive rock surface, the reaction slows down. If fractures short circuit flow so that water bypasses fresh surface, rates drop. Hydrogen purity matters because surface plants become large and power hungry when they must pull hydrogen out of dilute streams. Microbes in the subsurface can consume hydrogen and lower purity. The fluids can be very alkaline, which is rough on cement and some steels. Hydrogen is tiny, diffusive and can embrittle some alloys. Every one of those issues has a mitigation, but none are yet proven at the scale and duration that offtakers and lenders require. Sustained deliverability is a hard gate. Techno economic studies often use a per well target around 175 to 200 kg of hydrogen per hour at the wellhead, with purity at or above about 65%. That is roughly 4.2 to 4.8 tons per day. Held for 20 years, one well would deliver on the order of mid tens of thousands of tons. That is a lot of rock to contact. Back of the envelope calculations using literature yields of a few kilograms of hydrogen per cubic meter of fully reacted peridotite — olivine with some pyroxene — imply that a single successful well must sweep many millions of cubic meters of reactive volume over its life. That is feasible if fracture networks stay open and if stimulation accesses new surface over time. It is not feasible if the system gets covered by a thin, stable film—like iron-oxide or carbonate — early, if the fractures close or if operations short circuit flow. The analogy to shale is not perfect, but it is instructive. Shale wells show high initial rates and then steep declines because the accessible pressure and surface area close to the well get used up. Operators hold field level output by constantly drilling new laterals and adding stages, not by expecting single wells to sit on plateau for decades. An engineered hydrogen field would need its own version of that playbook, with planned step outs, staged access to new rock and periodic maintenance interventions, all while keeping chemistry and purity in bounds. Getting to that level of operational maturity takes many at bats in a short time. Shale scaled because thousands of wells across a few big basins let teams learn fast. Fluids, proppants, stage spacing, diverters and diagnostics improved because service companies worked every week in the same places and swapped ideas at the coffee truck. Engineered mineral hydrogen does not have that runway. The United States likely has only dozens of Tier 1 prospects when you demand the full system of source rock, reservoir and seal at accessible depth. The world likely has hundreds. Many sit in regions with limited oilfield services or with policies that constrain hydraulic stimulation. You can import spreads for a hub, and one hub with 80 to 120 wells is large enough to keep a crew busy for months, but a sparse map of projects slows the learning loop. That keeps costs high, cycle times long and confidence low for longer than offtakers can tolerate. The location of demand and the structure of incentives also tilt the field. Blue hydrogen is not new chemistry. It is reforming or partial oxidation of natural gas paired with capture and storage of carbon dioxide. It lives where gas lives, which is often the same place methanol and ammonia plants already sit. It connects to existing hydrogen pipelines and to salt cavern storage in some regions. It uses standard compressors and purification blocks. Policy in many countries supports carbon capture with long lived credits or contracts for difference. Policy for clean hydrogen sometimes supports any low carbon source, sometimes adds strict lifecycle accounting rules and sometimes narrows the window for project starts. In gas rich regions the mix of plant locations, pipeline access and policy support tends to make blue hydrogen easier to bank. The spread between modeled engineered mineral hydrogen costs and blue hydrogen costs is not large. Small misses on flow rate or purity can erase it. Lenders look at that spread and see risk. Regulation matters as much as geology and cost. Some states have broad restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, and many jurisdictions in Europe do as well. That does not stop all forms of stimulation, but it adds time and uncertainty. Electrical reservoir stimulation is promising and avoids some of the issues that drive water based fracturing opposition, but it still requires deep wells, high voltage equipment, rigorous monitoring and a receptive regulator. Developers can thread those needles in a few places, but it is not a recipe for fast replication across many basins. A development model that depends on new offtake plants standing up beside first of a kind subsurface systems in jurisdictions that are learning on the job is a hard sell. It is fair to ask what would have to be true for engineered mineral hydrogen to deserve plant scale offtake. The list is short and clear. A field trial would need to hold per well rates at or above the target with stable purity for a year, not a month. It would need to show that chemical or thermal maintenance restores performance when passivation or microbes drag it down. It would need to show that restimulation can reach new rock from the same pad without losing containment or purity. It would need to run a small hub of several dozen wells into a plant header and prove that the gathering, compression and purification work at scale without surprise outages. It would need to do all of that in a place where policy is steady and where service depth is real, and it would need to line up an offtaker that is willing to sign for 15 to 20 years. That is a tall stack. It is not impossible, but it is rare in extraction history for new subsurface systems to jump straight to bankable on the first or second try. There are glimmers of hope for some of this. Utah Forge and Fervo are experimenting with fracturing hard crystalline rock for enhanced geothermal, whichmy assessmentsuggests is a field rife with black swans. There might be some transferability from that to engineered mineral hydrogen. But it doesn’t move the skilled resources or the methanol and shale plants to the good ultramafic zones. Firms pursuing engineered mineral hydrogen include Vema Hydrogen, Halliburton, EXLOG, and Eden GeoPower, each working to stimulate water–rock reactions in ultramafic formations to produce hydrogen at scale, and a couple are big established oilfield services companies, presumably trying to find something to do with their kit and people with the decline of shale oil and gas looming, and in factalready pinching this year. None of this writes off the underlying chemistry. Water rock reactions make hydrogen naturally. Ultramafics are common worldwide. Small pilots are worth doing well, with careful measurement and open publication of results. There is a possible path where engineered mineral hydrogen fills niche markets, proves out a handful of rock types and develops a small but capable service craft. The claim that it will anchor world scale ammonia and methanol offtake in the next investment cycles needs more than promise. It needs long, clean data and a simple story for crews, plants and regulators in the places we actually build things. And, of course, the premise that dozens of good sites in the US and hundreds globally might turn into a new energy source should be treated as ludicrous hyperbole. In a world arranged differently this could look better. If ultramafic belts sat under the Gulf Coast and if ammonia and methanol plants were scattered across those belts, the learning curve might be short and the offtake risk small. In the world we have, the rigs and crews are in shale regions. The big chemical plants are near gas hubs and ports. Many of the ultramafic targets are somewhere else. Fracking ultramafic rock economically will take many cycles of trial and error, and there are not enough project sites in friendly places to climb that curve fast. The economics between engineered mineral hydrogen and blue hydrogen are close, and the policy and regulatory picture pushes capital toward blue in the same corridors. That combination makes first of a kind engineered mineral hydrogen hubs with long term offtake unlikely to reach bankability soon, if ever. If a developer proves otherwise with sustained rates, steady purity and a contract next door, that would be a welcome result. Until then, the prudent read is that engineered mineral hydrogen might be technically and economically viable in another world, and that in this one it faces a map and a market that point to a different outcome. is a climate futurist, strategist and author.

      "full_text": "Plug-in hybrids are now getting batteries bigger than some full battery-electric vehicles. I used to drive a first generation Nissan Leaf that had a 24kWh battery, so I am always fascinated to see plug-in hybrids (PHEV) with larger batteries. An example of this is the new Chery Tiggo 9 Super Hybrid PHEV that Chery says is a “masterful synthesis of plug-in hybrid innovation and exquisite design artistry.” This model, known as the Tiggo 9 CSH Vanguard, has a 34.4kWh battery pack, but Chery also has the 18.3kWh Tiggo 9 CSH Pinnacle. The Vanguard has a stated range of 160km in EV mode and 1,400km combined with the 1.5L turbo engine. The Pinnacle has a stated range of 90km in electric mode. The Pinnacle starts from R839,900, and the Vanguard starts from R989,900. The Chery Group, and its brands that include Omoda, Jaecoo, and Jetour, is doing extremely well in the overall South African market and is up to fourth place in July 2025, only behind Toyota, Suzuki, and Volkswagen. Legacy automakers with a presence in South Africa have been very slow to introduce plug-ins. Chery, on the other hand, has taken the initiative among the newer brands in the country to introduce plug-in hybrids. There are a growing number of plug-in hybrids with electric ranges above 100km that are now being offered in South Africa by these Chinese manufacturers, and these seem to be winning over some consumers. Among the Chinese brands, Chery appears to be leading this transition, offering plug-in hybrids at reasonable prices, and the South African market seems to be responding well to this. These offer consumers more value than the older generation PHEVs from some other markets that had electric ranges of less than 40km in real driving conditions. A lot of people commute between Pretoria, Centurion, Midrand, and Johannesburg, and PHEVs with a real range of over 90km will offer great value. A lot of people now also have solar at home, and charging these PHEVs with solar makes the value proposition financially stronger. Thanks to Chery & Co, there are more PHEV options with decent all-electric range available now in South Africa, and this could be one of the main reasons driving the growth in sales, whereas a few years ago, the few PHEV models available mostly had real electric ranges of around 50km and below. So with a claimed range of 160km in electric mode, this Tiggo 9 Vanguard should do well. Its more premium cousin, the Omoda C9, has a similar sized battery pack (34.46kWh) and a range of 150km, which is close to the Chery Tiggo 9. The Omoda C9 is priced from R999,000 and has been well received in South Africa. This should give an indication of how well the Tiggo 9 could do in South Africa. The Vanguard has motors giving a combined output of 455 kW. The torque is listed as 920 Nm. As more PHEVs enter the South African market, let’s take a look at the overall market and see the current state of the market. Vehicle Sales In South Africa From January to June 2025 As shown in the table above, vehicle sales in the overall market were up 14% YoY in the first 6 months of 2025. 278,890 vehicles were sold in South Africa in the first 6 months of the year. 97.4% of those were full ICE vehicles followed by plug-less HEVs with 2%. PHEVs had a market share of just 0.28% and BEVs had a market share of only 0.2%. Looking at the YoY performance, HEVs were down 6%, BEVs also took a heavy knock, down 24% YoY. PHEV sales experienced explosive growth, albeit from a very small base. PHEVs were up a whopping 162%. With more companies, especially the Chinese automakers, launching longer range PHEVs, sales of PHEVs look set to grow even further in the second half of the year. Legacy automakers should look at this trend carefully. Let’s look at Toyota, for example. Toyota South Africa appears to be favoring plug-less hybrids (HEV) over PHEVs. A look at the sales for H1 2025 supports this. From January 2025 to June 2025, Toyota South Africa sold a whopping 4,257 HEVs and only 4 plug-in hybrids. Yes, just 4 plug-in hybrids. The 4 were all Toyota Rav 4 PHEVs. Which is a real shame, as the PHEV Rav 4 is doing quite well in other markets around the world and it has decent electric range from its 18.1kWh battery. On the flipside, Toyota sold 521 Rav 4 HEVs. That’s a lot of HEVs compared with the PHEVs sold. The other popular HEV during this period was the Toyota Corolla Cross and it sold 3,374 units in the first 6 months of 2025. Toyota could singlehandedly boost the plug-in market in South Africa if it actually tries to promote them more. Toyota is the number one brand in South Africa by a significant margin. Also the PHEV Rav 4 has an 18.1kWh battery, similar to the Chery Tiggo 9 Pinnacle, however, Chery also offers a longer range Vanguard with a 34kWh battery pack. Something for Toyota to learn from Chery. HEV sales (dominated by Toyota South Africa) fell 6% in the first 6 months of 2025 in an overall vehicle market that is up 14% and PHEVs up 162%. Perhaps it’s time for Toyota to relook at its strategy for plug-ins in this market. Driving around South Africa you see prominent billboards of PHEVs like Chery Group’s Omoda C9. There are automakers going all out to promote PHEVs over HEVs and I think this messaging will grow and have a huge impact on adoption. These kinds of longer range PHEVs could just be what could help win over a huge percentage of the population that may still not be too sure about going all-electric. They could do most of their daily drive in electric mode and use the ICE component on longer trips. Chances are they will see that going all-electric is a better option and switch to BEV on their next purchase. This new generation of PHEVs could be the transition vehicles PHEVs were thought to be in the beginning. Remeredzai Joseph Kuhudzai has been fascinated with batteries since he was in primary school.

      "full_text": "Last Updated on:22nd August 2025, 05:15 pm We first sawEco-dynamic’ssolar awnings at RE+ and were excited to dig in deeper to showcase their roll-up awnings for RVs. Their awnings are much like a traditional roll-up shade awning for RVs, but with integrated, flexible solar panels that are designed to withstand the rigors of RV life and the wide range of weather conditions that come with it. The awnings can be sized widthwise by adding more of the roll up flexible panels to the awning to extend it further. They showcased a typical awning at RE+ with three of their roll-up solar panels integrated into it for a rated output of 800-900 watts of solar in ideal conditions. As an awning, Eco-dynamic’s offering delivers, with motorized action and integrated LED lighting which makes setting up camp that much easier. In addition, it provides invaluable shade while putting in some extra work to produce electricity for your auxiliary battery system at the same time. Because the awnings are built with Eco-dynamic’s flexible roll-up solar panels, they can be custom sized to suit the physical dimensions desired for the awning. Functionally, the solar awning would replace the awning typically found on the side of larger RVs, but with the added benefit of putting out power while it sits in the sun. It’s a great combination that makes it easy for RV owners or others looking to add a motorized awning to their build. Looking farther ahead into the future, it’s not hard to imagine a solar awning pushing power directly into the traction battery of a fully electric RV. 1,000 watts of additional solar production isn’t going to replace a DC fast charger anytime soon, but it’s clearly a meaningful amount of output for any electric vehicle. As of today, these solar panels are primarily designed to be used to charge the house battery and would not be well suited to directly charge an electric vehicle. This is primarily due to the lack of a DC to DC mppt charger that would make good use of the solar. Eco-dynamic’s core technology is the flexible roll-up solar panels that are used in the awnings, but they also make them in a wide range of sizes. They offer panels starting with a portable roll-up 40 watt solar panel that could be used on a backpacking or camping trip to keep your device charged up. Ramping up, they have a 220 watt roll-up panel that can be used in an awning configuration, as well as a larger 300 watt roll-up solar panel which was being used in their awning on display. These can be purchased as standalone solar panels or in a fully built awning. Eco-dynamic primarily sells systems directly to RV manufacturers, trailer builders, and the like. They are currently selling their 800 watt “Artpiece for RV” motorized awningon their websitefor $3,799. For more information about Eco-dynamic’s solar awnings head over totheir official website.

      "full_text": "The emerging field of space solar should have a spot on the federal energy policy to-do list, considering its potential for 24/7 baseload power generation. NASA also has two technologies in the works that researchers have identified as keys to unlocking the riches of space-based solar power. Still, the odds are against the US playing a significant role in the global space solar race, considering the topsy-turvy state of affairs over at the White House, where US President Donald Trump lives rent-free in a grass-covered, gold-plated world of his own invention. Grass has been much in the news this week, after the President touched upon the subject during a live television appearance in Washington, DC. However, let’s get to the latest space solar news first. Space-based solar power refers to technology that enables solar energy to be beamed down from the Sun to Earth on a 24/7 basis, regardless of the weather or time of day. Thetechnology piecesare at hand and the field is attractinginvestor interestas well as government support, with Europe, China, and Japan among the hotspots (see more space solarbackground here). Here in the US, the Department of Energy continues to providelip serviceto space solar on its website, but the action steps are spread among multiple federal agencies, all of which are subject to the whims of a Commander-in-Chief who appears to be increasingly out of touch with his surroundings. Returning to the topic of space solar, though, let’s be fair. If the President or anyone else in a position of authority suddenly began talking about space solar just a few years ago, they may have easily sparked a dementia alert on social media. The renowned US author Isaac Asimov popularized the idea of sending concentrated beams of solar energy down to Earth from outer space back in the 1940s, but even well into this century the goal of freeing the Earth from the on the on-again, off-again vagaries of ambient sunlight seemed far out of reach. Much water has passed under the bridge since 2011, when the philanthropists Donald and Brigitte Bren kickstarted action in the US space solar field with a donation to CalTech totalingmore than $100 million. “Northrup Grumman chipped in$12.5 million for several years, and thethe US Air Forceandthe US Navyhave also been exploring the space solar field,”CleanTechnicanoted last year. Leading up to this year, US Department of Energy has also played a key role through its support for perovskite solar cell research, among other fields. Last year NASA took stock of the situation and noted that their currentportfolio of activitiesincluded wireless power beaming among other supportive technologies, though direct funding for specific space-to-Earth activity was not in the cards. With NASA and DOE joining other federal agencies under the Trump chopping block, the odds are against further action on the part of the US government, at least for the time being. That leaves the field wide open for other nations to pile on, and a newly published study from a research team at King’s College London has just added fuel to the fire. “Space-based solar panelscould enable solar power to be harvested continuously instead of only when sunlight reaches Earth, reducing Europe’s need for Earth-based wind and solar by 80%,” Kings College explains. The study was published in the peer-reviewed journalJouleunder the title, “Assessspace-based solar powerfor European-scale power system decarbonization.” Of course there’s a catch, and that’s where NASA comes back into the picture. Kings College notes that if space solar is to play a significant role in Europe’s 2050 decarbonization goal, two of NASA’s supportive technologies must be called into action, the Innovative Heliostat Swarm and the Mature Planar Array. Neither one is in a ready state at this time. “The heliostat design is in the early stages of development but has higher potential to continuously capture solar energy, whereas the simpler planar array is closer to being technologically ready but can only capture solar energy around 60% of the time,” Kings College observes. Even 60% of the time sounds a lot better than the limited availability of sunlight on Earth, but the numbers don’t work out economically, which leaves the Innovative Heliostat Swarm to hold the torch. Based on costs projected by NASA, the Kings College team assessed that the heliostat design would outperform both wind and terrestrial solar by 2050. “Overall, the model estimated that the heliostat design would reduce total system costs by 7%–15%, offset up to 80% of wind and solar, and reduce battery usage by over 70%, though hydrogen storage would still be vital in the winter months for some regions,” the school summarized. Still, Mature Planar Array fans need not lose hope. The research team supports the idea of deploying near-term technological readiness as a stepping stone to longer-term solutions. Whether or not any of NASA’s space solar technology is available to anyone, anywhere, is up to the Commander-in-Chief. However, the current priority of the day appears to be grass, grass, and more grass. The urgent need for grass was on full display on Thursday, when the President went on live television to speak about the crisis in Washington, DC. Or not, as the case may be. Whether it was a simple failure to read the room, additional evidence of a slide into dementia, or something else entirely, the President — who recently ordered the Rose Gardengrass to be replaced with stone— used the occasion to pledge a soup-to-nuts makeover of all the parks in Washington, DC with brand new grass, and not just any old new grass. In widely reported remarks, he promised a leveling up to the standard of a Trump National Golf Club, such as it is (for the record, there is more than one Trump National Golf Club in the US). Thursday’s rumination upon grass was more than a little off-topic considering the chaotic state of affairs in the nation’s capitol, where a Soviet-style takeover of the local police department is well underway complete with military occupiers helicoptered in from at least four states —Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina — that tried and failed to take DC by force all the way back in 1860. Whelp, second time’s a charm. Nevertheless, the President insisted on drawing attention to, of all things, grass. “We’re going to bere-grassing all your parks, all brand new sprinkler systems, the best that you can buy,” the President said. “I know more about grass than any human being I think anywhere in the world,” he continued, adding that grass “has a life. You know that? Grass has a life. We have a life, and grass has a life.” Image: Space solar technology could provide the Earth with24/7 power, regardless of the weather or the season (via CalTech).

      "full_text": "In the midst of this year’s abrupt shift in federal energy policy, a glimmer of hope is shining on the rooftop solar field. The latest sign of fresh activity involves a new collaboration between the leading online solar marketplace EnergySage, the software-enabled buyer’s guide WattBuy, and the EV charging firm Qmerit. All three are now joined in the building decarbonization movement under the umbrella of the sprawling legacy firm Schneider Electric. The all-electric building of the future began to emerge in the early 20th century, but the journey to mass adoption has been long and slow. Most US households continue to burn gas, oil, propane, or wood for heat and hot water, with electricity pulling duty for other appliances. As of 2020, only 26% of US households usedelectricity as their one and only energy source, and most of them are concentrated in warm-climate states to the south. There’s a good reason for that. Electricity is a pricey way to run a heating system compared to natural gas and other fuels. Still, the building electrification movement has been growing in recent years with an assist from 21st century technologies including heat pumps as well as solar panels, energy storage, and electric vehicles. Innovation on the developer side also support the building electrification movement, with newmodular construction systemsamong the examples. Advocates also like to point out thatall-electric buildingsspare developers from the additional expense of arranging for gas connections. For that matter, some jurisdictions have forced the issue by placing outright bans on new gas hookups. Schneider Electric has been working on the three-way collaboration for several years, having previously formed a partnership with Qmerit and acquiring EnergySage. The acquisition of WattBuy, announced earlier this week, rounds out the decarbonization mission. “The acquisition will strengthen Schneider Electric’s ability to simplify and accelerate the energy transition for U.S. homeowners,” Schneider explained in a press statement. You can say that again.WattBuybrings a potential reach of more than 100 million households to the collaboration through its relationships with the home ownership stakeholders Redfin, Veterans United Home Loans, and Opendoor among others. Redfin, for example, has partnered with WattBuy to provide potential home buyers with an estimate of a home’s monthly electricity bills. WattBuy recommends electrification strategies for individual buildings through a free portal on their website. All they need is a street address (or zip code, if preferred), and they will provide company-specific recommendations for rooftop solar and storage systems among other electrical appliances. They also identify any available demand-response plans and community solar systems opportunities. Try ithere. EnergySage is a transparency-focused online marketplace that enables ratepayers to compare products and vendors without reinventing the wheel, and Qmerit brings its top-rated EV charger installation services to the mix. “Combined with EnergySage’s trusted marketplace and Qmerit’s national service network, Schneider Electric now offers an unmatched digital and physical pathway for electrifying the home,” Schneider explains. “This acquisition underscores Schneider Electric’s commitment to decarbonization at the grid edge and to delivering simple, scalable tools that accelerate the energy transition for consumers across the country,” The company emphasizes. If you caught that thing about decarbonization at the grid edge, that’s one way of letting everyone know that building decarbonization is its own thing. The electricity that comes into the building is another thing entirely. Ideally, it would come from one, or a combination of, the renewable resources that the US is favored with in abundance, with wind and solar coming out on top due to their affordability, accessibility and rapid construction timelines, followed bynew geothermal systemsover the longer term, withhydropowereventually chipping in through existing dam upgrades and new pumped storage projects. The US also has biomass in abundance, but the industry has faced some tough challenges in recent years. All in all, the renewable energy picture still looked bright as of March, when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a near-term forecast through the end of 2027. The agency anticipated thatthe US gridwould add more than 89 gigawatts of utility-scale solar and more than 22 gigawatts of wind by January of 2028. Although the new “American Energy Dominance” policy does support three other forms of utility-scale renewable energy — hydropower, geothermal, and biomass — FERC did not anticipate much activity in those sectors by 2028. Hydropower came in at just 1.3 gigawatts, reflecting the industry’s limited opportunities for expansion as well as its long construction timelines. The similarly constrained geothermal industry registered 89 megawatts. As for generating electricity from biomass, FERC anticipated that the industry will continue to shrink, not grow. With the data center construction boom in full swing, one would think that wind and solar would gain even more support from federal policy makers, particularly solar. After all, last year solar accounted for more than 90% ofnew capacity additions. However, every day is opposite day in the federal energy policy environment of today. The wind industry is now all but banished from federal property, including the all-importantoffshore lease areas. The solar industry has been likewise 86’d from federal lands. Opportunities remain among non-federal jurisdictions and private properties, but local opponents have gained fresh fuel from the White House. Wind and solar developers will have to tread more carefully than ever. On the bright side, the building decarbonization movement provides an opening for the rooftop solar industry to stay afloat until January 20, 2029, when the reins of federal energy policy will pass to another pair of hands — peacefully this time, one hopes. After all, US presidents come and go, but buildings can last for decades or even centuries. The US is already populated with millions of buildings, and millions of rooftops, that will stick around long after the current federal energy policy slides into the dustbin of history. The firmWood Mackenzie is among those crunching the numbers to see green gold in the rooftop solar movement over the long term. Earlier this month they calculated that the market potential market for the residential rooftop solar sector alone could reachapproximately 1,494 gigawattsby 2050. For other signs of a more energy-positive future, keep an eye on heat pumps,bidirectional EV charging, and other technologies at work in the building decarbonization movement. Policies change, but the technology is not going anywhere.

      "full_text": "During the recent opening of the newBYD Zhengzhou All-Terrain Race Track, Li Yunfei, General Manager of BYD Group’s Brand and Public Relations Department, shared several lists from the global automotive big data platformwww.autopat.cnshowing BYD well ahead in the global patent count for HEVs (conventional hybrid vehicles), BEVs (full battery electric vehicles), and overall NEVs (a term for plugin hybrids, BEVs, and hydrogen vehicles). This should not be a surprise to anyone who has been following BYD closely. Its 120,000+ R&D engineers currently submit an average of 45 patent applications and have 20 patents awarded per day. R&D spend is consistently higher than net profits. If you see BYD patent announcements in your news feed, there is clearly a lot going on. Even though many of the company’s patents are for other parts of its diverse business and do not appear on these lists, BYD has built a significant lead in EV intellectual property (IP). At this rate, the gap is poised to widen. Looking at the different lists, far more attention is being paid to BEV IP, with over 9 times as many patents compared to hybrids. While BYD overtaking Toyota’s previous lead in hybrid patents has historical significance, the BEV numbers are far more impactful. BYD clearly wanted you to pay attention to their position at the top, and the organization compiling the list wanted you to pay attention to national origin (we’ll get back to that). However, there are other interesting aspects to the ranking, especially when focusing on just BEVs. Toyota comes in at second with less than half as many BEV patents compared to BYD. However, it is interesting to see Toyota, as well as Honda at fourth, so prominently placed. We have tended to see them as a bit behind in the BEV market. In addition, Toyota has technology partnerships with BYD and FAW at fifth. As such, Toyota has access to significant BEV IP if it decides to put it to use. Beijing New Energy Vehicle Company, a division of BAIC Group, takes third position. While BAIC hasn’t seen as much attention lately, it partners with big names like Huawei, Canadian supplier Magna, Hyundai (#10), and Daimler. And it also makes its own brands, like Arcfox. BAIC was also recently found to have had the highest level of NEV subsidies to automakers in China from 2016 to 2022,over ⅓ of the total, which likely helped to fund its R&D (BYD, for comparison, received less than 1%). Following state-owned FAW, private sector Great Wall comes in at #6, while Geely comes in at #8. While these are two of BYD’s fiercest competitors in the market, they trail significantly in patents. Also, toward the bottom of the top 10 are Ford and GM. While their BEV commitment can sometimes come into question, similar to Toyota, they have clearly invested in developing the technology, and we can hope to see new innovations on the road in the coming years. At this stage, I think it is important to temper the emphasis on patent count a bit. Not all patents are created equal. Some seem to be a significant breakthrough, while others seem to be a relatively minor tweak to existing technology. However, especially when looking at abstracts out of context, what can seem to be relatively minor could be a significant breakthrough, and vice versa. Companies also apply for patents for different reasons. Sometimes it is to protect the technology of a product that they are introducing to the market. For BYD’s U7 technology showcase, for example, I seemed to be seeing many of the technologies in the car appearing as patent announcements while the vehicle was being displayed to the public. However, there are a wide range of patent strategies. Some offensive strategies focus on patenting an idea as early as possible to try to prevent competitors from developing those ideas. Some of those ideas never make it to market, like many of the fascinating inventions in thePopular Sciencemagazines that I read growing up. Sometimes, the intention of the patent is to license technology, rather than to produce it. Sometimes, companies will file for patents to prevent other companies with similar ideas from suing them for patent infringement. However, regardless of the strategy, patent count indicates an effort to develop and secure intellectual property. There are ways to build a viable company without controlling the patents. Companies can license technology, form partnerships, or access the technology through supplier relationships (like the above-mentioned Magna). Newer automakersHuawei and Xiaomi, for example, have focused patents on intelligent driving and connectivity, while also benefitting from EV technology developed with partners.But having IPisan advantage. Turning that advantage into a marketable, reliable, and profitable product is another challenge. As Edison is credited with saying, “Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.” Simply developing the idea enough to obtain a patent does not guarantee success. The organization publishing the lists was clearly emphasizing China’s lead in EV patent count, with BYD as the top company. Beyond sheer patent count, theNew York Timesalso examined China’s expanding lead in high-quality global patents and published research. Going from “copycat” to “innovator.” The effort put into legally securing intellectual property is in stark contrast to the persistent accusations that China is just stealing US IP. And the shift in patents indicates that the old model of Chinese companies relying on technology from JV partners is no longer the case. They should feel proud of that progress, but it is just part of the bigger picture. While it is easy to think about this in terms of competition, the proliferation of new patents also means that a lot of effort is being put into innovation around electric vehicles. That innovation is also an opportunity. Through licensing, partnerships, and supplier relationships, more advanced technology can be accessed. New inventions can also be built upon the innovations of others, even if a licensing agreement is needed for the foundational technology that underlies them. Companies are not just claiming a piece of the technology pie, but also making the pie much bigger. While those who are trying to close themselves off from the world might feel threatened, the potential for global collaboration based on the increasing flow of innovation is a reason to be optimistic.

It’s a bold step towards transforming a region once chained to coal into a shining example ofhydrogen infrastructureandindustrial decarbonization.Coal Byproducts Fuel a New EraOn August 18, 2025, the two inked a strategic cooperation agreement to supercharge R&D and roll outfuel cell technologyacross Lüliang in Shanxi Province. They’re not just talking – the program kicks off with 100 heavy-dutyhydrogen fuel cell trucksand 250 logistics vehicles, hauling raw materials for coking plants and serving urban cold-chain routes.Lüliang’s history is pretty straightforward: coal mining and coke ovens have ruled the roost, churning out a staggering 4.4 billion cubic meters of coke oven gas each year. Lucky for them, that byproduct is a goldmine: operators can tease out around 200,000 tonnes ofhydrogen productionannually—enough juice to keep a whole fleet of zero-emission trucks buzzing.

By pairing SinoHytec’s core fuel cell stacks with Pengfei’s refueling network and digital logistics know-how, they’re basically offering a one-stop shop for fleet operators.Why This Partnership MattersWith China gunning for carbon neutrality by 2060, greening its traditional energy hubs is top of the agenda. This team-up ticks every box: speeding up the commercialization ofhydrogen fuel cells, giving a leg-up to the coal region’s economy, and laying down a blueprint for reproduciblehydrogen infrastructurenetworks across the country. Policymakers are already eyeing it as a go-to model for large-scale rollouts.Opportunities and HurdlesOn the upside, they’re creating a full-circle supply chain—from turning coke oven gas into clean fuel to hitting the road with hydrogen-powered rigs. It’s a big win for opening new markets, slashing tailpipe emissions, and generating local jobs in tech, construction, and operations.But let’s be real: switching tohydrogen fuel cellsisn’t simply buying new trucks and calling it a day.

      "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Picture this: yoursmartphonediagnosing early-stage cancer by simply analyzing your breath. It sounds like sci-fi, right? Well, that moment is inching closer. On August 21, 2025,Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc.—the trailblazer inhigh-temperature proton exchange membrane (HT-PEM)innovation—teamed up with a leading U.S.-based global semiconductor and wireless technology player. Their goal? Co-develop and test next-genelectrochemical gas sensorsbuilt around Advent’s exclusiveIon Pair membrane.Why This Partnership mattersThis collaboration isn’t just about beefing upfuel cell technologyfor big power stations. Instead, it’s about shrinking that tech down into pocket-sized sensors for air quality checks, food-safety scans, and even non-invasive medical diagnostics—imagine bedside screening for biomarkers or breath-based early cancer detection. And we’re not talking bulky lab gear. These sensors could slot right intoportable electronicslike smartphones, wearables, or smart-home gadgets.Getting to Know the Ion Pair MembraneAt the heart of this project is Advent’s HT-PEMIon Pair membrane, originally cooked up atLos Alamos National Laboratory. Here’s what makes it tick:High-Temperature Stability:Keeps its cool (or heat) at elevated temperatures, boosting sensitivity and warding off contamination.Mechanical Robustness:Handles the stresses of microfabrication like a champ, paving the way for wafer-scale integration.Proton Conductivity:Powers precise electrochemical reactions, turning gas concentrations into clear electrical signals.In practice, trace gases—whether from air, breath, or food aromas—interact with tiny catalyst sites in the membrane. Protons zip through the structure, generating a current that directly corresponds to gas levels. It’s essentially the same principle behindhydrogen fuel cells, just miniaturized to detect parts-per-billion of target molecules.The Market Is Ripe for Tiny PowerhousesWe’re living in an era where remote monitoring, telemedicine, and the Internet of Things are converging. Demand for compact, low-power sensors is skyrocketing across industries. In an industrial setting, they’ll be vital for leak detection inhydrogen infrastructure—critical as pipelines and refueling stations lean on real-time safety monitoring. Meanwhile, restaurants, breweries, and food distributors need on-site gas analysis to keep products fresh. And consumers? They’re craving smarter air-quality tracking, whether they’re at home or on the move.How This Stacks Up Against Other SensorsSure, metal oxide semiconductor and MEMS-based sensors have made strides, but they often demand high operating temperatures or struggle with specificity. Advent’s Ion Pair HT-PEM approach offers a sweet spot: pinpoint selectivity at moderate power levels, plus a direct electronic readout that jives perfectly with digital electronics.Impact on Society and the EnvironmentEmbedding accurate gas sensors into everyday devices democratizes environmental monitoring. Imagine crowdsourced air-quality maps updated in real time by the phones in people’s pockets—no more wondering if that smog alert really applies to your street. Restaurants could scan spoilage gases at the pallet before it even reaches the shelves, slashing waste. Hospitals could breeze through breath-marker screenings for early disease detection, easing the load on lab facilities and cutting costs.Business and Strategy MovesWhat’s in it for the two partners? For Advent, it’s about broadening its patent fortress—around 150 issued or pending patents—and tapping into global semiconductor know-how. For the unnamed tech giant, it’s a chance to weave advancedsensor miniaturizationinto its chip roadmap, fast-tracking its entry into healthtech and environmental-monitoring markets.Both parties stand to gain from:Market Expansion:From city-wide air-monitoring networks to food-processing plants hungry for precise gas profiling.Healthtech Innovation:Telemedicine and point-of-care diagnostics are crying out for non-invasive, cost-effective screening tools.Consumer Electronics:Smartwatches, earbuds, and phones could boast a brand-new feature—molecular sensing on the go.Plus, this partnership could open licensing doors, as other device makers prefer adopting proven membrane materials rather than building them from scratch.Sizing Up the CompetitionBig names likeBoschandSonyhave rolled out MEMS-based gas sensors, but they often juggle power consumption and specificity. Advent’s Ion Pair platform could hit a unique sweet spot with robust performance at moderate temperatures, stellar selectivity, and seamless integration with the partner’s advanced wireless modules. Nail the cost curve, and these tiny sensors could shake up a market long dominated by bulky, less flexible modules.Livermore: Where Science Meets Startup VibeAdvent’s HQ inLivermore, California, sits smack in the innovation corridor that gave us Lawrence Livermore National Lab. With about 87,000 residents and a per-capita rent of $2,324, Livermore has transformed from a science outpost into a buzzing hub where material science collides with microelectronics and startup energy.Overcoming the Hurdles AheadMiniaturizing cutting-edge tech is never a cakewalk. The teams will need to:Prove long-term durability under repeated cyclingStamp out cross-sensitivity between different gasesMerge the membranes with existing chip-fabrication workflowsPerfect device packaging and power management to hit consumer-price targets in the cutthroat smartphone marketLooking Out to the HorizonIn the coming months, lab tests will put the Ion Pair sensors through their paces—checking sensitivity, selectivity, and endurance. If all goes well, prototype devices could pop up by late 2026, with small-batch production kicking off in 2027 and a full-blown commercial rollout by 2028. Beyond smartphones, these membranes might find homes in industrial automation systems, drone-based environmental mapping services, or futuristic fitness wearables that track metabolic biomarkers during workouts.It’s a clear sign that decades of R&D inhydrogen fuel cellsaren’t just confined to vehicles. Membranes, catalysts, and stack designs fine-tuned for heavy-duty transport are now getting a second wind in sensor tech. That kind of cross-pollination is exactly what sparks major leaps in innovation.Ultimately, this pact underscores a broader shift: as we build outsustainable energysystems and push forindustrial decarbonization, supporting technologies like gas sensors become indispensable. They ensure safety inhydrogen infrastructure, boost public health through better air-quality monitoring, and open doors to new consumer experiences that weave zero-emission tech into everyday life.The Catalystwill be keeping a close eye on how these micro-sensors evolve—from Livermore lab benches to the devices in your pocket—and what breakthroughs lie around the corner.About Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc.Headquartered in the U.S. with major operations in Greece, Advent sits at the cutting edge ofHT-PEM fuel cell technology, backed by about 150 patents.

The teams will need to:Prove long-term durability under repeated cyclingStamp out cross-sensitivity between different gasesMerge the membranes with existing chip-fabrication workflowsPerfect device packaging and power management to hit consumer-price targets in the cutthroat smartphone marketLooking Out to the HorizonIn the coming months, lab tests will put the Ion Pair sensors through their paces—checking sensitivity, selectivity, and endurance. If all goes well, prototype devices could pop up by late 2026, with small-batch production kicking off in 2027 and a full-blown commercial rollout by 2028. Beyond smartphones, these membranes might find homes in industrial automation systems, drone-based environmental mapping services, or futuristic fitness wearables that track metabolic biomarkers during workouts.It’s a clear sign that decades of R&D inhydrogen fuel cellsaren’t just confined to vehicles. Membranes, catalysts, and stack designs fine-tuned for heavy-duty transport are now getting a second wind in sensor tech. That kind of cross-pollination is exactly what sparks major leaps in innovation.Ultimately, this pact underscores a broader shift: as we build outsustainable energysystems and push forindustrial decarbonization, supporting technologies like gas sensors become indispensable. They ensure safety inhydrogen infrastructure, boost public health through better air-quality monitoring, and open doors to new consumer experiences that weave zero-emission tech into everyday life.The Catalystwill be keeping a close eye on how these micro-sensors evolve—from Livermore lab benches to the devices in your pocket—and what breakthroughs lie around the corner.About Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc.Headquartered in the U.S. with major operations in Greece, Advent sits at the cutting edge ofHT-PEM fuel cell technology, backed by about 150 patents. Born out of Los Alamos National Laboratory, the company trades on NASDAQ under the ticker ADN.Spread the love This collaboration isn’t just about beefing upfuel cell technologyfor big power stations. Instead, it’s about shrinking that tech down into pocket-sized sensors for air quality checks, food-safety scans, and even non-invasive medical diagnostics—imagine bedside screening for biomarkers or breath-based early cancer detection. And we’re not talking bulky lab gear. These sensors could slot right intoportable electronicslike smartphones, wearables, or smart-home gadgets. Getting to Know the Ion Pair MembraneAt the heart of this project is Advent’s HT-PEMIon Pair membrane, originally cooked up atLos Alamos National Laboratory. Here’s what makes it tick:High-Temperature Stability:Keeps its cool (or heat) at elevated temperatures, boosting sensitivity and warding off contamination.Mechanical Robustness:Handles the stresses of microfabrication like a champ, paving the way for wafer-scale integration.Proton Conductivity:Powers precise electrochemical reactions, turning gas concentrations into clear electrical signals.In practice, trace gases—whether from air, breath, or food aromas—interact with tiny catalyst sites in the membrane. Protons zip through the structure, generating a current that directly corresponds to gas levels. It’s essentially the same principle behindhydrogen fuel cells, just miniaturized to detect parts-per-billion of target molecules.The Market Is Ripe for Tiny PowerhousesWe’re living in an era where remote monitoring, telemedicine, and the Internet of Things are converging. Demand for compact, low-power sensors is skyrocketing across industries. In an industrial setting, they’ll be vital for leak detection inhydrogen infrastructure—critical as pipelines and refueling stations lean on real-time safety monitoring. Meanwhile, restaurants, breweries, and food distributors need on-site gas analysis to keep products fresh. And consumers? They’re craving smarter air-quality tracking, whether they’re at home or on the move.How This Stacks Up Against Other SensorsSure, metal oxide semiconductor and MEMS-based sensors have made strides, but they often demand high operating temperatures or struggle with specificity. Advent’s Ion Pair HT-PEM approach offers a sweet spot: pinpoint selectivity at moderate power levels, plus a direct electronic readout that jives perfectly with digital electronics.Impact on Society and the EnvironmentEmbedding accurate gas sensors into everyday devices democratizes environmental monitoring. Imagine crowdsourced air-quality maps updated in real time by the phones in people’s pockets—no more wondering if that smog alert really applies to your street. Restaurants could scan spoilage gases at the pallet before it even reaches the shelves, slashing waste. Hospitals could breeze through breath-marker screenings for early disease detection, easing the load on lab facilities and cutting costs.Business and Strategy MovesWhat’s in it for the two partners? For Advent, it’s about broadening its patent fortress—around 150 issued or pending patents—and tapping into global semiconductor know-how. For the unnamed tech giant, it’s a chance to weave advancedsensor miniaturizationinto its chip roadmap, fast-tracking its entry into healthtech and environmental-monitoring markets.Both parties stand to gain from:Market Expansion:From city-wide air-monitoring networks to food-processing plants hungry for precise gas profiling.Healthtech Innovation:Telemedicine and point-of-care diagnostics are crying out for non-invasive, cost-effective screening tools.Consumer Electronics:Smartwatches, earbuds, and phones could boast a brand-new feature—molecular sensing on the go.Plus, this partnership could open licensing doors, as other device makers prefer adopting proven membrane materials rather than building them from scratch.Sizing Up the CompetitionBig names likeBoschandSonyhave rolled out MEMS-based gas sensors, but they often juggle power consumption and specificity. Advent’s Ion Pair platform could hit a unique sweet spot with robust performance at moderate temperatures, stellar selectivity, and seamless integration with the partner’s advanced wireless modules.

With about 87,000 residents and a per-capita rent of $2,324, Livermore has transformed from a science outpost into a buzzing hub where material science collides with microelectronics and startup energy.Overcoming the Hurdles AheadMiniaturizing cutting-edge tech is never a cakewalk. The teams will need to:Prove long-term durability under repeated cyclingStamp out cross-sensitivity between different gasesMerge the membranes with existing chip-fabrication workflowsPerfect device packaging and power management to hit consumer-price targets in the cutthroat smartphone marketLooking Out to the HorizonIn the coming months, lab tests will put the Ion Pair sensors through their paces—checking sensitivity, selectivity, and endurance. If all goes well, prototype devices could pop up by late 2026, with small-batch production kicking off in 2027 and a full-blown commercial rollout by 2028. Beyond smartphones, these membranes might find homes in industrial automation systems, drone-based environmental mapping services, or futuristic fitness wearables that track metabolic biomarkers during workouts.It’s a clear sign that decades of R&D inhydrogen fuel cellsaren’t just confined to vehicles. Membranes, catalysts, and stack designs fine-tuned for heavy-duty transport are now getting a second wind in sensor tech. That kind of cross-pollination is exactly what sparks major leaps in innovation.Ultimately, this pact underscores a broader shift: as we build outsustainable energysystems and push forindustrial decarbonization, supporting technologies like gas sensors become indispensable. They ensure safety inhydrogen infrastructure, boost public health through better air-quality monitoring, and open doors to new consumer experiences that weave zero-emission tech into everyday life.The Catalystwill be keeping a close eye on how these micro-sensors evolve—from Livermore lab benches to the devices in your pocket—and what breakthroughs lie around the corner.About Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc.Headquartered in the U.S. with major operations in Greece, Advent sits at the cutting edge ofHT-PEM fuel cell technology, backed by about 150 patents. Born out of Los Alamos National Laboratory, the company trades on NASDAQ under the ticker ADN.Spread the love Sure, metal oxide semiconductor and MEMS-based sensors have made strides, but they often demand high operating temperatures or struggle with specificity. Advent’s Ion Pair HT-PEM approach offers a sweet spot: pinpoint selectivity at moderate power levels, plus a direct electronic readout that jives perfectly with digital electronics. Impact on Society and the EnvironmentEmbedding accurate gas sensors into everyday devices democratizes environmental monitoring. Imagine crowdsourced air-quality maps updated in real time by the phones in people’s pockets—no more wondering if that smog alert really applies to your street. Restaurants could scan spoilage gases at the pallet before it even reaches the shelves, slashing waste. Hospitals could breeze through breath-marker screenings for early disease detection, easing the load on lab facilities and cutting costs.Business and Strategy MovesWhat’s in it for the two partners? For Advent, it’s about broadening its patent fortress—around 150 issued or pending patents—and tapping into global semiconductor know-how. For the unnamed tech giant, it’s a chance to weave advancedsensor miniaturizationinto its chip roadmap, fast-tracking its entry into healthtech and environmental-monitoring markets.Both parties stand to gain from:Market Expansion:From city-wide air-monitoring networks to food-processing plants hungry for precise gas profiling.Healthtech Innovation:Telemedicine and point-of-care diagnostics are crying out for non-invasive, cost-effective screening tools.Consumer Electronics:Smartwatches, earbuds, and phones could boast a brand-new feature—molecular sensing on the go.Plus, this partnership could open licensing doors, as other device makers prefer adopting proven membrane materials rather than building them from scratch.Sizing Up the CompetitionBig names likeBoschandSonyhave rolled out MEMS-based gas sensors, but they often juggle power consumption and specificity.

      "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Picture this: Europe’s refineries aren’t just grinding out fuels—they’re buzzing with renewable vibes, aiming to crank out half a million tonnes ofgreen hydrogenby 2030. Sounds like a stretch? Well, over$5 billionis already on the table, so it’s more reality than sci-fi. Thanks to the EU’sRED IIIpush and next year’sDelegated Acts, the race forindustrial decarbonizationis in full swing. So, how are these energy giants pivoting, why themaritime sectoris a game-changer, and what speed bumps are lurking ahead? Let’s break it down.Context: EU’s Regulatory PushTheEuropean Unionjust turned up the heat on climate goals, demanding industries slash emissions big time. UnderRED III, refiners have to swap out fossil hydrogen for renewable or low-carbon blends. On top of that, the 2025Delegated Actslay down the law on lifecycle greenhouse-gas cuts—so any hydrogen made via electrolysis or SMR with CCUS better meet those strict targets. Problem is, some member states are dragging their feet on national rulebooks, putting projects in limbo.The Refinery ShiftFor decades, oil hubs leaned on gray hydrogen straight from fossil fuels. Now, they’re plowing money intohydrogen productionthrough water electrolysis powered by sun and wind, or steam methane reforming paired with carbon capture, utilization, and storage. The payoff? Emissions could tumble by over 70%. Industry insiders say parts of the sector can green up fast and without breaking the bank. With capital commitments north of$5 billionand auction bids forgreen hydrogendropping—about 18% across the EU and a whopping 55% dive in German tenders—costs are finally heading south.Maritime OpportunityWe all know you can’t just slap a plug into a cargo ship—electrification at sea has limits. That’s why themaritime sectoris setting its sights on hydrogen derivatives like ammonia and methanol. Under theFuelEU Maritimerules and the IMO’s Net Zero Framework, shipping lines need greener fuel options. Picture bunkering ammonia made fromgreen hydrogenalongside regular marine diesel—it’s a solid bridge to zero-emission voyages on those long-haul routes.Challenges and OutlookIt isn’t all smooth sailing, though. Policy whiplash and price premiums for clean hydrogen still bite, and until every country nuts-and-bolts theRED IIIrules, progress will stay patchy. On the bright side, theEU Hydrogen Bankis doling out support, and plans for guarantee of origin standards should crank up market clarity forhydrogen infrastructure.Come 2030, refiners will be eyeing roughly0.5 million tonnesofgreen hydrogeneach year just to stay compliant, which shows the scale of this shift. While renewable fuels of non-biological origin in transport are pegged at a modest1%, knock-on effects in aviation, chemicals, and beyond could be huge as supply stabilizes and costs fall.At the end of the day, Europe’s refinery heavyweights stand at a crossroads. If costs keep sliding and regulations lock in, these plants could morph into hubs forsustainable energy—fueling industry, shipping, and possibly more. It’s a bold bet onindustrial decarbonizationand the future ofsustainable energy, one that could redraw the continent’s energy map for decades to come.Spread the love TheEuropean Unionjust turned up the heat on climate goals, demanding industries slash emissions big time.

      "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Picture a floating fueling station—no docks or concrete pads, just a sleek steel barge bobbing along the Mississippi. That’s exactly whatPort of South Louisianahas in the works: a cutting-edgehydrogen fueling bargeready to pumpe-methanoland other green fuels straight into ships, totally changing the game for marine refueling.Project Overview and ScopeThe port has put out a call for bids on a custom-built vessel designed to carryGrade C flammable liquids. At its heart ise-methanol—a synthetic marine fuel crafted by combininggreen hydrogenfrom renewable electrolysis with captured CO₂. In plain terms, this barge turns the river into a refueling superhighway. It’s powered by a Build Back Better Regional Challenge grant from theU.S. Economic Development Administration, matched by funding and technical support fromLouisiana Economic Development. As part of theH2theFutureinitiative, the barge complements an array of projects—electrolyzers, hydrogen pipelines, workforce training programs—all aimed at acceleratingindustrial decarbonizationin South Louisiana.Comprehensive engineering and fabrication plans covering steel sourcing, internal coatings, and system integration.Performance guarantees for transfer rates and leak-prevention systems.Optional add-ons: long-term maintenance, crew training, and remote monitoring services.Proven safety expertise with hydrogen-based fuels and marine fueling systems.Technical Design HighlightsThis non-self-propelled, double-hulled steel barge packs:Five pairs of insulated cargo tanks with corrosion-resistant linings, perfect for storinge-methanol.A pump house capable of 6,000 barrels per hour loading and 1,000 gallons per minute offloading.Advanced safety gear: automatic leak detectors, remote shutoff valves, foam suppression, and secondary containment.Interchangeable hose connections compatible with existing shore-side bunker equipment.Future-ready pipework prepped for pure hydrogen transfer, making upgrades seamless as markets evolve.Designed to meet or exceedU.S. Coast GuardandEPAregulations, the barge features a SCADA system for real-time operations oversight—fueling everything from tugboats to small ferries.Strategic and Business BenefitsWhy float your fueling station? First off, vessels save hours by skipping back-and-forth trips, cutting congestion at busy docks and slashing operating costs. For the port, it unlocks new revenue streams—fuel sales margins, handling fees, service contracts, you name it. Withhydrogen infrastructureinvestment on the rise, South Louisiana scores a first-mover advantage. Early entry into thegreen hydrogenbunkering market positions the port as a hub forzero-emissiontech, attracting operators eager to meet stricter emissions standards. Plus, it boosts the port’s ESG profile, potentially lowering the cost of capital as financiers reward real decarbonization efforts.Advancing Industrial DecarbonizationThe Mississippi corridor already handles massive volumes of industrial hydrogen used in refining and chemical processes. Switching marine bunkering from diesel toe-methanolcan cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 100%, provided renewable feedstocks are used. That shift not only helps Louisiana hit its net-zero-by-2050 targets but also reduces nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions that affect nearby communities.

For the port, it unlocks new revenue streams—fuel sales margins, handling fees, service contracts, you name it. Withhydrogen infrastructureinvestment on the rise, South Louisiana scores a first-mover advantage. Early entry into thegreen hydrogenbunkering market positions the port as a hub forzero-emissiontech, attracting operators eager to meet stricter emissions standards. Plus, it boosts the port’s ESG profile, potentially lowering the cost of capital as financiers reward real decarbonization efforts.Advancing Industrial DecarbonizationThe Mississippi corridor already handles massive volumes of industrial hydrogen used in refining and chemical processes. Switching marine bunkering from diesel toe-methanolcan cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 100%, provided renewable feedstocks are used. That shift not only helps Louisiana hit its net-zero-by-2050 targets but also reduces nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions that affect nearby communities.

      "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report The once-sleepy industrial town ofIracemápolisin São Paulo State woke with a roar.Great Wall Motorheld the grand opening of its shiny new Brazilian plant and rolled out the country’s first heavy-dutyhydrogen fuel cellstruck, powered by theGWM HYDROGEN FTXTsystem. It’s a milestone forhydrogen fuel cells, proving they’re more than a lab novelty—they’re ready for Brazil’s demanding roads. The plant is a key link in GWM’s global network bridging China and Latin America, a real frontline in the drive forindustrial decarbonizationunder Brazil’s blazing sun and humid skies.After sealing a 2023 MoU with the São Paulo State Government to explore hydrogen applications,GWMdidn’t waste a moment: by 2024, five refueling stations had popped up across the state. On day one in Iracemápolis, the factory rolled out a rig packing a 105 kWh battery and a 40 kg hydrogen tank. Starting this September, these trucks will hit the highways of São Paulo and Minas Gerais for road tests in partnership with theUniversity of São PauloandUNIFEI. The mission? Prove that thiszero-emission technologycan haul heavy loads, top up in minutes, and run on bothgreen hydrogenand ethanol-sourced hydrogen. Over 1,000 km of real-world trials will reveal the true range under full load.Here’s the scoop: on August 16, the Iracemápolis plant flung open its doors, unveiling Brazil’s first operational fuel cell electric truck. The state governments of São Paulo and Minas Gerais are backing the project, following a November 2024 agreement withUNIFEIto build outgreen hydrogensupply andhydrogen infrastructure. So far, five hydrogen stations are up and running, aligning with Brazil’s MOVER program to clean up freight transport. FTXT even ran initial trials with prototype units in 2024.The upcoming tests will tackle loading cycles, range demos across tropical lowlands and plateau regions, and refueling drills. Data fromUSPandUNIFEI—think vehicle telemetry, fuel economy, and system durability—will feed back into product tweaks and an export playbook for Chinese hydrogen solutions eyeing global markets hungry for sustainable energy options.Dive into the tech, and you’ll see FTXT’s customhydrogen fuel celltechnology at the core. It pairs a 105 kWh lithium-ion battery with a high-pressure fuel cell stack fueled by 40 kg of compressed hydrogen, emitting nothing but water vapor. They’re touting a 60% peak efficiency, though real-world numbers might flex a bit. Hydrogen tanks store the gas at 350 bar, and early dry runs have already logged cold-start performance and thermal management under Brazil’s summertime heatwaves.Fuel comes from two sources: renewable-powered electrolysis and ethanol reforming—leveraging Brazil’s biofuel infrastructure to diversifyhydrogen production. Mixing these methods in the pilot will highlight cost and performance trade-offs, guiding decisions on scaling, logistics, and local feedstock availability.This launch is China’s clean-energy exporters making a calculated play.GWMand its unit,FTXT Energy Tech, are cementing their footprint in Latin America, while Brazil secures tech transfer and workforce upskilling. The 2023 MoU with São Paulo set the stage; the 2024 pact with Minas Gerais strengthened a network spanning R&D, refueling, and policy alignment.Officials tout this as a blueprint for regional adoption ofhydrogen infrastructure. For GWM, it’s about credibility and market share in the globalhydrogen fuel cellsrace. For Brazil, it underscores its strategic pivot away from diesel and a commitment to carbon-neutral targets without compromising heavy freight capabilities—riding the wave of China’s Belt and Road green-energy projects.Brazil’s biofuel journey began in the 1970s, but heavy-duty trucks have lagged behind. Electric trucks have hit range and charging constraints that hydrogen can sidestep with rapid refuels and longer hauls. Still, the hydrogen roadmap has steep hurdles: high electrolyzer costs, swinging ethanol feedstock prices, and capital-intensivehydrogen infrastructurerollouts. Regulators also face the task of crafting safety codes for handling high-pressure hydrogen—a non-trivial undertaking.Even with five stations in São Paulo, nationwide coverage is years away. Market forces—fuel price volatility, maintenance demands, competition from battery trucks—will test whether hydrogen shifts from pilot stage to mainstream solution. Logistics in remote areas could also trip up supply consistency.This program isn’t just about semis; it’s about building talent and ecosystems. Researchers atUSPandUNIFEIwill get hands-on experience, and local technicians will learn to service fuel cell stacks and refueling hubs. We’re talking dozens of high-skill jobs in engineering, maintenance, and logistics—laying a foundation forindustrial decarbonizationin the region.Beyond new employment, this initiative sparks knowledge transfer that could turbocharge Brazil’s own R&D ingreen hydrogen, setting the stage for cross-sector rollouts in shipping, industry, and power generation—essential for genuineindustrial decarbonization. Word is local spare-part supply chains are already forming around Iracemápolis.Seeing a hydrogen-fueled 18-wheeler roar to life in Brazil is downright thrilling. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves—hype can outpace economics. Unless green hydrogen costs plummet and supply chains prove bulletproof, this may stay a flashy pilot rather than a freight revolution. I’ll be watching the price-per-kilometer and downtime stats before popping any celebratory corks. And remember: a few breakdowns could dash political goodwill faster than you think.Trials kick off in September 2025, and monthly updates fromUSPandUNIFEIwill drop performance metrics. If the data checks out, GWM will press for broader rollouts across Latin America. If not, this project might become a textbook case on the limits of early-stage hydrogen tech. Stakeholders will also be eyeing public acceptance and regulatory tweaks needed for widerhydrogen infrastructuredeployment.Spread the love After sealing a 2023 MoU with the São Paulo State Government to explore hydrogen applications,GWMdidn’t waste a moment: by 2024, five refueling stations had popped up across the state.

If the data checks out, GWM will press for broader rollouts across Latin America. If not, this project might become a textbook case on the limits of early-stage hydrogen tech. Stakeholders will also be eyeing public acceptance and regulatory tweaks needed for widerhydrogen infrastructuredeployment.Spread the love Officials tout this as a blueprint for regional adoption ofhydrogen infrastructure. For GWM, it’s about credibility and market share in the globalhydrogen fuel cellsrace. For Brazil, it underscores its strategic pivot away from diesel and a commitment to carbon-neutral targets without compromising heavy freight capabilities—riding the wave of China’s Belt and Road green-energy projects.Brazil’s biofuel journey began in the 1970s, but heavy-duty trucks have lagged behind. Electric trucks have hit range and charging constraints that hydrogen can sidestep with rapid refuels and longer hauls. Still, the hydrogen roadmap has steep hurdles: high electrolyzer costs, swinging ethanol feedstock prices, and capital-intensivehydrogen infrastructurerollouts. Regulators also face the task of crafting safety codes for handling high-pressure hydrogen—a non-trivial undertaking.Even with five stations in São Paulo, nationwide coverage is years away. Market forces—fuel price volatility, maintenance demands, competition from battery trucks—will test whether hydrogen shifts from pilot stage to mainstream solution. Logistics in remote areas could also trip up supply consistency.This program isn’t just about semis; it’s about building talent and ecosystems.

      "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Ever thought a hydrogen fuel cell and a landfill would make an odd couple? Well, meet the match you didn’t see coming.H2 Power ’n’ Heat GmbHhas dropped its modularH2 Power Boxunits right next to the waste site run byH2 Core Systems GmbHin Germany’s Gifhorn district. Nestled in Ausbüttel’s rolling meadows, thisRenewable energy pilotis quietly cranking out zero-emission power and heat exactly where it’s needed. Buckle up—off-grid power just got a major upgrade.Since 2016, Berlin-basedH2 Power ’n’ Heathas been tinkering with mobile and stationary systems that turnGreen hydrogeninto clean electricity and warmth. Meanwhile,H2 Core Systems GmbH, headquartered near Heide, has been perfecting full-cycle hydrogen solutions—fromelectrolyzersto fuel cells—for factories, infrastructure, and everything in between. After countless lab tests, field trials, and those “eureka” moments, these two agile SMEs teamed up to show the world howDecentralized energycan roll out at startup speed, not on a decade-long government schedule.This pilot sits next to a waste site cradled by woodlands and farmland—proof that you don’t need giga-projects or fancy pipelines to makeHydrogen fuel cellswork. Just drop a few modules, hook up the plumbing, and watch them hum away, cutting noise, smells, and carbon footprints all at once.And here’s the kicker: you don’t have to slog through years of planning. These micro-pilots spin up in weeks, not years. That’s the magic ofDecentralized energy: instant deployment, instant impact.Local councils and environmental agencies jumped on board early, seeing gold in regional decarbonization and circular economy innovation. Whether you run a farm, a festival, or a B&B, you can plug in this setup without calling in a battalion of engineers—just good old off-grid power you can brag about over coffee and have live by lunchtime.What This MeansPure zero-emission output: Wave goodbye to soot, smog, and local pollutants.Grid-friendly microgrid: Replaces diesel generators, eases peak-load stress, and keeps lights on when the main grid stumbles.Circular economy win: Turns landfill byproducts into a clean energy loop—waste meetsGreen hydrogen.Budget-stable fueling: Hydrogen refills tame the wild swings of diesel prices.Modular scaling: Snap in as manyH2 Power Boxunits as you need—no oversized generators draining cash.Smoother logistics: Shipping hydrogen beats hauling oil for safety and simplicity.Municipalities, rural communities, and industrial parks can finally lock in predictable energy costs without sweating surprise bills or emissions fines. This isn’t sci-fi—it’s a real-worldRenewable energy pilotthat provesOff-grid powercan be robust, reliable, and eco-friendly.Imagine remote telecom towers, island clinics, or mountain lodges ditching diesel for whisper-quiet hydrogen fuel cells. Cleaner air, fewer particulates, and healthier wildlife—now that’s a win-win.The Technology: The Magic IngredientH2 Power Box fuel cell modules: Plug-and-play units that convert stored hydrogen into electricity and heat through electrochemical magic—no combustion, no exhaust.Electrolyzers: Powered by renewable juice, these split water into hydrogen and oxygen, then stash that hydrogen in slick composite tanks until you call on it.At the heart of it all areproton exchange membrane (PEM)stacks—quick to fire up and unfazed by frosty mornings in Lower Saxony. The electrolyzers can throttle their power draw to match wind or solar availability, making this duo the dream team for pairing with on-site turbines or PV arrays.Safety nerds rejoice: every module ticks EU compliance boxes, from double containment to seamless SCADA or IoT integration for remote monitoring. And don’t overlook the waste heat—it can warm offices, greenhouses, or industrial processes, nudging overall efficiency above 80%.Real-World TestRight beside Ausbüttel’s landfill near Gifhorn, the team hauled in crates ofH2 Power Boxmodules and bid farewell to cranky diesel gensets. Since flicking the switch, thisRenewable energy pilothas been quietly powering key operations:Illuminating maintenance sheds and perimeter lights.Delivering cozy heat to admin buildings and workshops.Operating silently—no smoke stacks or on-site emissions.Numbers are still rolling in, but early chatter praises the uptime and steady performance. Thanks to the modular design, from delivery to go-live took mere weeks. Operators keep tabs via a slick mobile dashboard, getting instant alerts if hydrogen pressure dips or upkeep is due. When locals popped by for open days, they left with jaws on the floor—a landfill never felt so futuristic.Strategic AngleZoom out, and you’ll see this project is a perfect fit for Germany’sEnergiewendeand the EU’s bigger push forGreen hydrogen. While the giants chase mega-hubs, nimble SMEs likeH2 Power ’n’ Heat GmbHandH2 Core Systems GmbHare swooping in to fill the gaps, proving real impact can happen on a regional timetable, not three parliaments down the road.Public funds and incentives have poured billions into hydrogen R&D, and this pilot shows how fast that cash can spark circular economy gold. Partnering with Fraunhofer and other research outfits meant rigorous testing and quicker certifications. Plus, all that data streaming out of Ausbüttel is a regulator’s dream—fueling smarter safety rules, permitting processes, and grid-connection guidelines.Don’t overlook the ripple effects through local supply chains either: tank fabricators, service workshops, and engineering firms are all scoring new business, creating fresh green-tech jobs. And when clouds roll in or winds drop, these hydrogen backup systems stand ready to fill the gap—perfect for smoothing out intermittent renewables.Zooming OutRollout at dozens of landfills, factories, and logistics hubs craving resilience.New training programs and green jobs sprouting up in regional towns.On-siteGreen hydrogenhubs paired with solar farms or biogas units, creating self-contained energy ecosystems.EU-wide pilot networks standardizingDecentralized energymicrogrids and boosting cross-border collaboration.Analysts predict microgrids could be as widespread as rooftop solar by 2035, shifting the market toward software, integration, and service.This isn’t a lab gimmick—it’s a ready-to-roll blueprint. That once-quiet landfill in Gifhorn is now a beacon of zero-emission power and heat. If you’re overseeing a municipality, an industrial park, or a waste facility and you want to kick diesel to the curb while supercharging resilience,Hydrogen fuel cellsare your ticket—today, not someday.Dream big: replicate at multiple sites, weave in demand-side management, or tap into surplus wind, solar, or biogas for yourGreen hydrogenfeedstock.

This isn’t sci-fi—it’s a real-worldRenewable energy pilotthat provesOff-grid powercan be robust, reliable, and eco-friendly.Imagine remote telecom towers, island clinics, or mountain lodges ditching diesel for whisper-quiet hydrogen fuel cells. Cleaner air, fewer particulates, and healthier wildlife—now that’s a win-win.The Technology: The Magic IngredientH2 Power Box fuel cell modules: Plug-and-play units that convert stored hydrogen into electricity and heat through electrochemical magic—no combustion, no exhaust.Electrolyzers: Powered by renewable juice, these split water into hydrogen and oxygen, then stash that hydrogen in slick composite tanks until you call on it.At the heart of it all areproton exchange membrane (PEM)stacks—quick to fire up and unfazed by frosty mornings in Lower Saxony. The electrolyzers can throttle their power draw to match wind or solar availability, making this duo the dream team for pairing with on-site turbines or PV arrays.Safety nerds rejoice: every module ticks EU compliance boxes, from double containment to seamless SCADA or IoT integration for remote monitoring.

      "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report If you’ve been keeping an eye on thegreen hydrogenmarket,M-Spinjust gave you a reason to pay extra attention. This UK start-up, spun out ofImperial College Londonin 2024, just closed a £1.2 million seed round and scored a £25,000 grant from theHenry Royce Institute. Their secret sauce? A novelmetallic nanofiber mesh electrodethat promises to superchargeelectrolyser performance—and could sliceproduction costsby 20–30%.Born from seven years of tinkering at Imperial’sEnergy Futures Lab, the founding crew—four PhD chemists and two electrochemical engineers—has already locked down two patent families coveringmetal electrospinning recipesandbinderless mesh architectures. In short, they’ve built a fortress around their IP as they gear up to scale. And with industry veterans on their advisory board for electrolyser manufacturing and scale-up, they’re hardly flying blind.Strategic UpsideEarly institutional backing isn’t just a gold star; it’s a green light for more investors and strategic partnerships. Even better, M-Spin’s retrofit-friendly design lets operators drop these mats into existing electrolyser stacks—no rip-and-replace required. That kind of simplicity sings to:Electrolyser OEMshunting for a quick product boost without reinventing the wheel.Project developerschasing lower capex and faster commissioning.Energy retailerskeen to lock in bulkgreen hydrogensupplies and tighten margins.Europe’s push for 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen by 2030 means massive upside for low-cost electrolysers. M-Spin’s already in talks with anchor customers in the UK and Germany, where procurement pipelines are heating up. Their mesh could fast-track profitability for gigawatt-scale facilities by trimming upfront spend and boosting runtime efficiency.Technical SnapshotAt the core is a fresh spin onelectrospinning. Instead of polymer or carbon fibers, M-Spin’s R&D team—shout-out to Professor Nigel Brandon’s lab—has dialed in metal-based recipes. Here’s the nutshell version:Fiber diameter:500 nm to 1 µm, balancing toughness with high surface exposure.Porosity:Up to 90%, which smoothed out mass transport of reactants and gas release.Surface area:As much as 1,000× that of metallic foams, multiplying active sites for water splitting—the core ofhydrogen production.Material versatility:Nickel, iron, copper and ceramics—each tuned to specific electrolyser chemistries.In lab-scale trials (50 cm² electrodes), they’ve hit current densities north of industry benchmarks, running stably at 1 A/cm² for more than 100 hours. Next up: scaling to 1 m² modules, with demo units planned for Q1 2026. And roll-to-roll tests at the Henry Royce Institute show the concept can stretch to industrial volumes.Historical MomentumFor too long, electrode tech was the choke point inelectrolysis. Early alkaline and PEM systems leaned on clunky metal foams with limited active area. Nanostructured fixes have popped up in journals over the past decade, but few ever made the leap from lab to factory. M-Spin’s mesh fuses nanoscale engineering with manufacturing pragmatism—just as Europe’s Hydrogen Strategy and the UK’s Ten Point Plan unlock over £1 billion forsustainable energyandindustrial decarbonizationprojects.Competitive LandscapeIt’s a crowded arena: legacy electrolyser makers still rely on sintered foams and mesh from big suppliers like Linde, while a handful of start-ups in Germany and the US chase nano-coated or laser-etched electrodes. M-Spin’s edge? A native nanofiber network that skips costly coatings and extra post-processing steps. In plain English, that means a lower cost per square meter of electrode—critical when you’re rolling out multi-gigawatt installations.Market OutlookGlobal electrolysis capacity is poised to leap from under 2 GW today to over 100 GW by 2030, driven by net-zero pledges and booming renewables. Annual hydrogen market revenues could top $300 billion by mid-decade. In that landscape, a 20–30% capex cut in electrolysers translates into tens of billions saved. For early movers like M-Spin, that’s a shot at serious market share—provided the performance and durability live up to expectations.Technical HurdlesThe real test lies in long-haul durability: corrosion resistance, mechanical fatigue under cyclical loads, and survival in harsh alkaline or acidic environments. M-Spin’s 100-hour runs are a promising start, but 10,000-hour data will make or break their levelized cost-of-hydrogen models. And building roll-to-roll modules means nailing thermal management and seal integrity to prevent membrane damage and gas crossover.Collateral ImpactsIf this nanomesh delivers, the ripple effects could reshape multiple sectors:Heavy industry:Green hydrogenat $1.50–2.00/kg could finally decarbonize steel, refining and ammonia.Ammonia production:Lower energy inputs might cut fertilizer costs—a boon for global food security.Mobility:Fuel cell fleets become more cost-effective as fuel expenses drop.Energy storage:More efficient electrolyser-capacitor hybrids smooth out renewable intermittency.Supply chains:Demand for nickel, copper and ceramics spikes, fueling upstream investment.Fuel cell tech:These mesh designs could boost electrode performance in fuel cell mode too.Beyond just cutting costs, these shifts fuel broadersustainable energyadoption and underscorehydrogen’s role in industrial decarbonization.Main InsightsPrototypes show up to5× higher hydrogen outputand20–30% cost reduction, according to M-Spin—results that look great but still need independent verification.Roll-to-roll processing combined with retrofit compatibility slashes deployment times compared to greenfield redesigns.Backing from Imperial’s spin-out ecosystem and the Henry Royce Institute accelerates iteration cycles and rigorous testing.Next StepsM-Spin is gearing up pilot-scale trials at Imperial’s hydrogen labs to prove multi-thousand-hour durability. They’re negotiating licensing deals with OEMs across Europe and Asia to fast-track market entry, and exploring dual-use mesh designs that work in bothelectrolysisand fuel cell modes—streamlining supply chains for end users.Expert ViewpointFrom where I’m sitting, M-Spin nails a critical balance: a high-performance nanostructure that’s genuinely scalable. The long-duration data will be the ultimate decider, but if they hit their cost and durability targets, expect faster project approvals, bolder offtake deals and a reconfigured investment picture forsustainable energyinfrastructure. Whether you’re an investor hunting for the next big thing inelectrolysisor an operator chasing a lower TCO, M-Spin’s nanomesh deserves a hard look—it just might be the materials breakthrough that pushesgreen hydrogeninto the mainstream.Spread the love Born from seven years of tinkering at Imperial’sEnergy Futures Lab, the founding crew—four PhD chemists and two electrochemical engineers—has already locked down two patent families coveringmetal electrospinning recipesandbinderless mesh architectures.

Whether you’re an investor hunting for the next big thing inelectrolysisor an operator chasing a lower TCO, M-Spin’s nanomesh deserves a hard look—it just might be the materials breakthrough that pushesgreen hydrogeninto the mainstream.Spread the love In lab-scale trials (50 cm² electrodes), they’ve hit current densities north of industry benchmarks, running stably at 1 A/cm² for more than 100 hours. Next up: scaling to 1 m² modules, with demo units planned for Q1 2026. And roll-to-roll tests at the Henry Royce Institute show the concept can stretch to industrial volumes. For too long, electrode tech was the choke point inelectrolysis. Early alkaline and PEM systems leaned on clunky metal foams with limited active area. Nanostructured fixes have popped up in journals over the past decade, but few ever made the leap from lab to factory. M-Spin’s mesh fuses nanoscale engineering with manufacturing pragmatism—just as Europe’s Hydrogen Strategy and the UK’s Ten Point Plan unlock over £1 billion forsustainable energyandindustrial decarbonizationprojects.Competitive LandscapeIt’s a crowded arena: legacy electrolyser makers still rely on sintered foams and mesh from big suppliers like Linde, while a handful of start-ups in Germany and the US chase nano-coated or laser-etched electrodes. M-Spin’s edge? A native nanofiber network that skips costly coatings and extra post-processing steps. In plain English, that means a lower cost per square meter of electrode—critical when you’re rolling out multi-gigawatt installations.Market OutlookGlobal electrolysis capacity is poised to leap from under 2 GW today to over 100 GW by 2030, driven by net-zero pledges and booming renewables. Annual hydrogen market revenues could top $300 billion by mid-decade. In that landscape, a 20–30% capex cut in electrolysers translates into tens of billions saved. For early movers like M-Spin, that’s a shot at serious market share—provided the performance and durability live up to expectations.Technical HurdlesThe real test lies in long-haul durability: corrosion resistance, mechanical fatigue under cyclical loads, and survival in harsh alkaline or acidic environments.

      "full_text": "The German state of Bavaria has commissioned a €4.2 million ($4.9 million) photovoltaic system along a 35-meter stretch of airport access road near Munich. Bavarian officials inaugurated a new photovoltaic system on State Road 2584 west of Munich Airport near the Hallbergmoos junction this week. Bavarian Minister-President Markus Söder, Transport Minister Christian Bernreiter, and State Chancellery Minister Florian Herrmann attended the opening. The four-lane airport access road has been equipped with 35 meters of solar modules. Installed on the roof, the modules cover about 1,100 square meters, with an additional 135 square meters on the south side. The Bavarian Ministry of Transport estimates the system’s total output at just under 210 kW and the investment at approximately €4.2 million. Construction of the project is scheduled to begin in September 2024. The solar power generated will feed the Freising municipal utility grid and directly power emergency call boxes, traffic counters, and the road’s control technology. The Ministry of Transport said the project will provide insights into the practical feasibility of PV roofing on roads. The goal is to make solar use of infrastructure areas economically viable and support the Bavarian Climate Protection Program. The ministry noted that the PV system generates enough electricity to cover the annual consumption of 70 households. Officials added that roads offer untapped potential for renewable energy generation, combining mobility with energy production while minimizing land use and advancing the energy transition.

      "full_text": "Jakson Engineers Ltd. will invest more than INR 80 billion ($912.7 million) to build a 6 GW solar wafer-to-module plant in Madhya Pradesh, with modules expected by May 2026 and cells by September 2026. Jakson Engineers, part of the energy and infrastructure conglomerate Jakson Group, will invest more than INR 80 billion to build a 6 GW integrated solar module, cell, and wafer manufacturing plant at Maksi Phase II in Madhya Pradesh. The project will be developed in two phases on a 110-acre site recently allocated to the company. Site work will begin within 15 days. In Phase I, Jakson will commission 3 GW of solar modules and 3 GW of solar cells with an investment of about INR 20 billion. Phase II will add a 6 GW solar wafer plant and another 3 GW each of modules and cells, with an investment of more than INR 60 billion. The first solar modules from the plant are expected in May 2026, followed by cells in September 2026. “This is a momentous occasion for our company and a major leap forward for India’s renewable energy sector,” said Sundeep Gupta, vice chairman of Jakson Group. “Our investment in Maksi is testament to our unwavering commitment to ‘Make in India’ and directly supports the nation’s ambitious clean energy targets. We are confident that with the support of the Madhya Pradesh government, this plant will become a beacon of technological excellence and a catalyst for creating green jobs.” Gagan Chanana, joint managing director and CEO of Jakson Solar Modules and Cells, noted that global demand for solar energy is rising. Chanana claimed that the company’s integrated “four-in-one” model will help meet India’s energy needs, lower costs, speed technology deployment, and strengthen energy security. Madhya Pradesh was selected for the project because of its central location, infrastructure, investor-friendly environment, and renewable energy policies. The plant is expected to create more than 1,000 jobs during construction and about 1,400 permanent positions once operational. This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

      "full_text": "Germany has logged 453 hours of negative day-ahead power prices this year, already above the total in 2024, while hours above €100 ($116.,54)/MWh have also surpassed last year. These figures are likely to draw the attention of operators of large battery storage systems. On the first day of this week, sunny and windy conditions combined with low grid load produced additional hours of negative exchange electricity prices, surpassing last year’s record of 453 hours. As of Aug. 24, Germany had recorded 457 hours of negative day-ahead exchange prices. This trend was evident earlier in the year, with 389 hours logged in the first half. July added another 12 hours, while August has so far contributed 56 hours of negative exchange prices. The number of hours above €100/MWh has also already exceeded last year’s level. Blackout and crisis preparedness expert Herbert Saurugg analyzed the data for his platform, estimating 2,476 hours above €100/MWh so far this year, compared with 2,310 in 2023. During the energy crisis following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, there were far more peak price phases. Saurugg calculated 7,379 such hours in 2022 and 4,116 in 2023. For operators of large-scale battery storage, whose margins depend on electricity price spreads, these are favorable conditions. Even as several large storage systems are under construction and being connected to the grid in Germany, the market outlook remains unchanged. Expansion of solar and wind power continues, supported by Federal Minister of Economics Katherina Reiche (CDU). RWTH Aachen University’s “Battery Charts” show that about 800 MWh of capacity have been added to large-scale battery storage this year. Researchers now place total large-scale battery storage capacity at 3.0 gigawatt hours. By comparison, the Market Data Register shows almost 8.65 GW of new solar installed in the first seven months of 2024, lifting cumulative photovoltaic capacity above 109 GW in July.

      "full_text": "Energy storage in Brazil is entering a period of accelerated growth. Despite the absence of a legal framework, companies are expanding battery production, diversifying models, and preparing storage to play a central role in the energy transition. Solar deployment has been a success story in Brazil, but the need for more battery energy storage capacity is increasingly urgent. The Brazilian energy storage market is at a turning point. Driven by rising energy bills, the instability of the electricity grid and a search for greater autonomy, the sector is expected to grow exponentially between now and 2030, even in the absence of definitive regulation. The Brazilian Association of Storage Solutions (ABSAE) estimates that the country could reach 25 GW of installed capacity and attract BRL 44 billion ($8 billion) in investments during this period. The combination of distributed generation, electromobility, extreme weather events, and pressure for energy reliability is shaping a new demand profile that requires scalable, flexible and economically viable solutions. Against this backdrop,pv magazine Brasilreached out to executives from companies operating in the country to understand their plans regarding technology and industrial development, as well as the challenges they face.

They catalogued a sampling of twenty-five commercially available 4 mm connectors. Examples of 4 mm single-pole DC PV connectors representative of those currently commercially available Image: NREL, Solar Energy, CC BY 4.0 A group of researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy'sNational Renewable Energy Laboratory(NREL) andSandia National Laboratorieshas created a standardized terminology for PV connectors in an effort to reduce confusion and offer best practices for their deployment. In the study “Standardized nomenclature for photovoltaic connectors,” which was recently published inSolar Energy, the scientists explained that terms like “MC4-compatible” and “cross-mating,” for example, are often a source of potential installation faults. “Given the critical role of PV connectors and the consequences of their failure, the authors of this paper believe a common understanding of connector components and their functions is essential,” the scientists stated, noting that no common language currently exists to define either the components or their functions. “The present lack of standardization can cause confusion and potentially lead to improper installations, diagnoses, or maintenance practices.” Their work consisted initially of quantifying the existing nomenclature and then suggesting terms for components without misleading implications. Then they created a catalog of twenty-five 4 mm PV connectors that are available in the market. For their survey, which included 33 respondents from the PV industry and the scientific community, they used publicly available product documents from 20 manufacturers and data from the International Photovoltaic Quality Assurance Task Force (PVQAT). The manufacturer documents comprised schematics, datasheets, installation manuals, catalogs, and relevant patents. The proposed terms were chosen based on their functionality, avoidance of confusion, prevalence of use, and effectiveness. “Feedback from installers and O&M personnel was strongly considered in discussions regarding the effectiveness of the terminology,” the research team specified, adding that their focus was on key components such as housings, locking tab, locking slot, O-ring, gland nut, cable grip, cable seal, socket, pin, contact spring, contact retainer, contact barbs, and cable crimp. Their work also included identifying those terms that could potentially cause confusion and suggesting not to use them. “Our hope is that the solar industry will adopt this recommended nomenclature to improve communication and reduce misunderstandings that could lead to unintended adverse consequences,” the academics concluded.

      "full_text": "Фото: Ilya Moskovets / Globallookpress.com Уже в сентябре в России будет обеспечен профицит бензина благодаря завершению ремонтов на нефтеперерабатывающих заводах (НПЗ). Об этом со ссылкой на информацию, озвученную на совещании у вице-премьера Александра Новака с участиями глав крупнейших нефтяных компаний, состоявшемся 25 августа,пишут«Известия». По словам источника, в следующем месяце производство увеличится до 3,4 миллиона тонн, в то время как в среднем ежемесячное потребление в стране, указала управляющий партнер компании «ВМТ Консалт» Екатерина Косарева, составляет 3,18 миллиона. Другой собеседник издания отметил, что «Газпром» сообщил о завершении ремонта на газоперерабатывающем заводе в Астрахани, что позволит с 30 августа запустить выпуск дизтоплива, а с 7 сентября — бензина. По итогамсовещанияНовак поручил регионам усилить разъяснительную работу с населением для снятия ажиотажа, а Федеральной антимонопольной службе (ФАС) — проверить обоснованность резкого роста розничной стоимости топлива на отдельных АЗС на Дальнем Востоке. Предыдущее совещание у Новака, состоявшееся 14 августа, закончилось рекомендацией нарастить импорт бензина из Белоруссии и продлить полный запрет экспорта на сентябрь. В материале указывается, что соответствующее постановление опубликуют в ближайшие дни. Также по информации издания правительство приняло решение об изменении параметров демпфера в пользу нефтяников. Механизм работает таким образом, что компенсирует производителям потери в случае, если те продают топливо в России по ценам ниже экспортных, и забирает сверхприбыль в обратном случае. Однако если биржевые цены отклоняются от индикативных слишком сильно, компании лишаются компенсации. В настоящее время допустимым считается отклонение на 10 процентов для бензина и на 20 процентов для дизельного топлива. Его предлагается довести до 15 и 25 процентов соответственно, что позволит нефтяникам получать выплаты даже при значительном росте. Ранее сообщалось, что проблемы с доступностью бензина для населения возникли в пяти регионах — это Крым, Запорожская и Сахалинская области, Забайкальский и Приморский край. Главной причинойназываетсяснижение производства, связанное как с плановыми ремонтами, так с возобновлениематакбеспилотников на НПЗ. На этом фоне к середине августа стоимость бензина на Петербургской бирже обновила рекорд.",

      "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Marine shipping is still hooked on heavy fuel oil, churning out around 940 million tonnes of CO₂ every year. With the International Maritime Organization eyeing a 50% emissions cut by 2050, we’re going to need legit zero-emission technology to hit those targets.VINSSENandMarinteknikshook hands on an MOU in Singapore that could upend the status quo. They’re rolling out ahydrogen-ready battery-based hybrid propulsion system—a plug-and-play solution you start out running as a diesel-hybrid and then seamlessly flip to fullhydrogen fuel cellsor battery-electric power when the ports are set up for green hydrogen bunkering. Of course, building it is one thing; proving it commercially at sea is a whole other ballgame.Turning the Tide in Maritime DecarbonizationThe MOU brings togetherVINSSEN—the South Korean crew behind Korea’s first AIP-certified hydrogen vessel and a type-approved 60 kW PEM fuel cell stack—andMarinteknik, Singapore’s trusted partner for vessel design and turnkey projects for over four decades. They’re pitching a super-modular setup: interchangeable fuel cell and battery pods, smart digital control units and a diesel genset as a backup. Captains can dip their toes in with diesel-hybrid mode, nail down performance on shorter routes, then plug in zero-emission modules as the hydrogen infrastructure evolves—no major engine-room remodel required.Inside the Hybrid PowertrainAt its heart, the system blends three power sources: diesel gensets, battery banks andhydrogen fuel cells. VINSSEN’s cloud-based vessel management platform keeps an eye on power demands, route data and safety stats in real time. It juggles load between diesel and batteries to optimize cost and emissions, then flips to hydrogen cells for silent, zero-emission cruising when ports are ready to refuel with clean energy. Those AIP-certified 60 kW PEM modules hit peak efficiencies of up to 55% and pass all the marine vibration tests. Batteries handle peak loads, slashing genset time by about 40% in trials. And because everything comes in ISO container-sized skids, swapping modules during port calls is literally a plug-and-play job. Safety’s covered too: double-walled hydrogen tanks, fail-safe valves and next-gen leak detection wired into the digital brain—just what regulators want to see.Playing the Long GameThis partnership isn’t just about hardware—it’s a strategic chess move.VINSSENlocks into Southeast Asia’s booming shipping scene, riding on Marinteknik’s deep ties with shipowners and regulators. Marinteknik, meanwhile, fast-tracks its foray into hydrogen propulsion without investing a fortune in R&D. Their rollout plan is smart: kick off with tugs and ferries, then scale up to offshore support vessels and smaller cargo ships. Each successful pilot builds confidence, nudging leasing companies and insurers to warm up to hydrogen’s risks. And with a regional push onsustainable energy, they’re betting that a 20% cut in fuel costs versus diesel-hybrids will seal early deals and set the bar for competitors.Singapore: From Bunker Fuel to Hydrogen Hub?Singapore handles more cargo than almost anywhere else—over 37 million TEUs a year—and it’s desperate to shake off heavy fuel oil’s nasty emissions. LNG bunkering’s already live, methanol trials are wrapping up, and electric ferries are on the water. Under the Maritime Green Plan 2030, the city-state wants green corridors linking it to Australia and Japan, aiming to slice up to 10 million tonnes of CO₂ in the next decade. The Maritime and Port Authority is dangling grants covering up to 30% of green tech capex, and the Economic Development Board is lining up anchor tenants for hydrogen bunkers. Hosting VINSSEN-Marinteknik pilots cements Singapore as a test-bed: ports fine-tune bunkering protocols, crews get honed on hydrogen-handling, and regulators draft real-world safety rules. Nail a 30% emissions cut with solid uptime, and this local MOU could become the blueprint for Jakarta, Shanghai or even Dubai.The Real-World HurdlesDon’t kid yourself—it’s not going to be smooth sailing. Green hydrogen production in Asia is still in its infancy, with electrolysis capacity clustered in a handful of mega-projects, so supply remains patchy. Building a pan-Asian network of high-pressure hydrogen bunkering stations will demand billions inhydrogen infrastructureinvestments and policy stability that outlasts election cycles. Onboard, those beefy tanks and safety systems eat into cargo space, and crews need rock-solid training; a leak demands split-second action. Regulators must sync up standards on bunkering, storage and emergency response across multiple jurisdictions—a legal and logistical maze. Cost is another pinch point: retrofitting hybrids with hydrogen gear runs 20–30% higher than diesel-hybrids. Operators will only take the plunge if carbon levies, subsidies or long-term fuel savings tip the scales. Untilhydrogen fuel cellsstack up on price, we could see adoption stall after a few flashy demos. Insurers are still guessing on hydrogen conversions too—steep premiums could push financing costs sky-high unless governments step in with guarantees.Looking Over the HorizonLet’s be real: this MOU isn’t going to sink fossil-fuel shipping overnight, but it’s a crucial pilot for unlockingzero-emission technologyat sea. IfVINSSENandMarinteknikcan prove they can deliver reliable, cost-effective service on Singapore’s busiest lanes, hydrogen might finally move from lab bench to mainstream shipping fuel. The trick? Ports, policies and purse strings all have to line up.

Marinteknik, meanwhile, fast-tracks its foray into hydrogen propulsion without investing a fortune in R&D. Their rollout plan is smart: kick off with tugs and ferries, then scale up to offshore support vessels and smaller cargo ships. Each successful pilot builds confidence, nudging leasing companies and insurers to warm up to hydrogen’s risks. And with a regional push onsustainable energy, they’re betting that a 20% cut in fuel costs versus diesel-hybrids will seal early deals and set the bar for competitors.Singapore: From Bunker Fuel to Hydrogen Hub?Singapore handles more cargo than almost anywhere else—over 37 million TEUs a year—and it’s desperate to shake off heavy fuel oil’s nasty emissions. LNG bunkering’s already live, methanol trials are wrapping up, and electric ferries are on the water.

      "full_text": "Мы продолжаем отслеживать итоги индийских конкурсных отборов на поставки зеленого аммиака производителям удобрений. Уже состоялось девять аукционов, проведенных индийской государственной корпорацией солнечной энергии (SECI). Ранееотмечалось, что их результаты свидетельствуют о конкурентоспособности зеленого аммиака – цены лишь немного выше нынешних цен на «серый» аммиак. По итогам девятого конкурсного отбора победителем стала индийская компания ACME, предложившая рекордно низкую цену49,75 рупий (0,568 доллара США) за килограмм аммиака. Это уже четвертая победа ACME. В июле компаниявыигралапервый из серии аукционов, предложив у 55,75 индийских рупий (0,64 доллара США) /кг для поставки 75 тысяч метрических тонн зеленого аммиака в год индийскому производителю удобрений Paradeep Phosphates Limited в течение 10 лет. В этот раз по условиям тендера ACME будет поставлять 100 тысяч тонн NH3 в год на объект Индийского фермерского кооператива удобрений (IFFCO) в Парадипе, штат Одиша. Установленная цена составляет примерно 568 долларов США за тонну, при этом цена на серый аммиак в Индии — около 515 долларов США за тонну. Разница небольшая, и с учетом того, что цена на зеленый аммиак фиксирована на длительный срок, условия договора выглядят конкурентоспособными. SECI заявила, что проведенные тендеры «укрепили доверие, обострили конкуренцию и обеспечили конкурентоспособные по мировым меркам цены». В августе 2021 года премьер-министр Индии Нарендра Модиобъявило запуске «Национальной водородной миссии» (National Green Hydrogen Mission) с целью сделать Индию «глобальным центром производства, потребления и экспорта зеленого водорода и его производных». Миссия нацелена на производство 5 миллионов тонн зеленого водорода к 2030 году и связанное с этим развитие мощностей возобновляемой энергетики. В феврале 2022 года Индия опубликовалаполитикув области зеленого водорода / зеленого аммиака (Green Hydrogen/ Green Ammonia Policy). В рамках Миссии правительство Индии сформировало набор стимулов для «перехода на зеленый водород» — Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT). Набор включает в себя предоставление субсидий на производство электролизеров и зеленого водорода внутри страны. В 2023 году ACMEанонсировалаинвестиции в размере 270 миллиардов рупий (3,3 миллиарда долларов США) в проект завода по производству зеленого водорода и аммиака в штате Одиша на востоке Индии. Полная мощность предприятия составит 1,3 миллиона тонн зеленого аммиака в год. В 2024 году ACMEподписаласоглашение с японской промышленной группой IHI на предмет продажи 400000 тонн «зеленого» аммиака в год, начиная с 2028 года. Использование зеленого аммиака для производства удобрений — актуальная тема. В 2024 году норвежская Yaraоткрылазавод по производству зелёного водорода (крупнейший в Европе на то время), который будет использоваться для производства аммиака.

Сегодня Gentari сообщила о заключении соглашения со строительной и инжиниринговой фирмой Gamuda на предмет реализации проектов солнечной энергетики общей мощностью 1,5 гигаватт (ГВт) для снабжения электроэнергией крупномасштабных центров обработки данных (ЦОД) в рамках малазийской национальной Программы поставок возобновляемой электроэнергии предприятиям (CRESS). Солнечные электростанции будут также оснащаться системами накопления энергии (батареи), размеры которых не указываются. Программа CRESS позволяет компаниям закупать ВИЭ-электроэнергию непосредственно у генераторов с поставкой через национальную сеть. В совместном заявлении компаний отмечается, что они будут способствовать удовлетворению «неотложной необходимости» расширения мощностей ВИЭ для удовлетворения растущего спроса на электроэнергию крупномасштабных центров обработки данных в Малайзии, который, как ожидается, достигнет 5 ГВт к 2035 году. Национальная дорожная карта энергетического перехода Малайзии (NETR) предусматривает увеличение доли возобновляемой энергетики в установленной мощности энергосистемы до 40% к 2035 году и до 70% к 2050 году. В маесообщалось, что Саудовская Аравия планирует инвестировать $10 млрд в возобновляемую энергетику Малайзии. Бум строительства центров обработки данных (ЦОД) ведет к росту потребления электроэнергии. В апреле Международное энергетическое агентство (МЭА) выпустило специальныйдоклад, посвященный влиянию ЦОД на энергетический сектор. В нём прогнозируется, что к 2030 году потребление электроэнергии центрами обработки данных в мире увеличится более чем в два раза и составит около 945 ТВт*ч. Во многих странах эти растущие потребности будут покрываться с помощью возобновляемых источников энергии. Например, по китайскимнормам, дата-центры в КНР должны получать 80% электроэнергии из возобновляемых источников. В июле в Китаереализованпервый проект прямого зеленого электроснабжения ЦОД.

При этом выбросы CO2 в энергетическом секторе страны, который является основным эмитентом выбросов,сократились более чем на 3%в первой половине года, поскольку рост только солнечной генерации «перекрыл» весь прирост потребления электроэнергии, который составил 3,7%. Использование угля в электроэнергетике Китая сократилось на 3,4% по сравнению с аналогичным периодом годом ранее, тогда как использование газа увеличилось на 6%, что привело к снижению выбросов в секторе в целомна 3,2%. Анализ Carbon Brief показывает, чторекордное увеличениемощностей солнечной энергетики позволит Китаю сократить выбросы CO2 за 2025 год в целом. Единственным крупным сектором, где наблюдался рост выбросов в первой половине года, стала химическая промышленность, а вот выбросы в секторе производства строительных материалов сократились на 3%. Однако даже если выбросы Китая сократятся в 2025 году, ему, скорее всего, не удастся достичь ряда важных климатических целей, включая цели по снижению интенсивности выбросов углерода (выбросов на единицу ВВП), контроль за ростом потребления угля и новыми мощностями угольных электростанций, а также увеличение доли стали, производимой в электродуговых печах, в общем объеме производства стали. Доля электродуговой стали в общем объеме производства снизилась с 10,2% в 2024 году до 9,8% в первой половине 2025 года, несмотря на целевой показатель правительства в 15% на этот год. Ожидается, что в текущем году мощности угольных электростанций резко возрастут, несмотря на сокращение спроса на электроэнергию, вырабатываемую за счёт угля. Государственная электросетевая компания прогнозирует прирост тепловой мощности в 127 ГВт. В том числе мощности угольных ТЭС могут вырасти на 80-100 ГВт. Напомню Китай официально стремитсядостичь пика выбросов углекислого газа до 2030 года иуглеродной нейтральности до 2060 года. В апреле исследовательская компания BloombergNEFпредположила, что пик энергетических выбросов углерода в мире был пройден в 2024 году. Согласен сПолитикой конфиденциальности",

      "full_text": "Uganda is widely known for being the land of hundreds of thousands of motorcycle taxis (boda bodas) — buzzing around transporting millions of passengers. Uganda also has a special place in the history of boda bodas. That’s because, over 50 years ago,Ali Mayende’s innovation in the border town of Busia sparked a revolution that has become the lifeblood of East African public transport. As detailed in that article from African Arguments, Ali Mayende began ferrying passengers from Busia, a small town on the edges of Eastern Uganda, to the border with Kenya in the 1960s. Others followed, giving birth to the boda boda industry. Now a big phenomenon on the African continent, the motorcycle taxi industry is attracting huge attention and investment. These motorcycle taxis are the heartbeat of the passenger and small goods transport system in a lot of countries in Africa. Close to 30 million motorcycles on the continent are used in this motorcycle taxi industry. With almost 99% of them still being internal combustion engine motorcycles, there is a huge opportunity and a large addressable market for electrification. The move towards electric vehicles in Africa, especially in this electric motorcycle sector, has mainly been driven by the private sector by small startup companies. Most of the developments in Africa’s electric motorcycle sector have been concentrated along what is now known as the “boda belt.” The boda belt, a term coined by Tom Courtright, is a stretch of countries on the African map where motorcycle taxis have been prominent over the years. This belt stretches from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to the outskirts of Dakar, Senegal. There is also significant activity in North African countries such as Morocco, where smaller scooters are used mainly for personal transportation, unlike in East Africa and West Africa, where most of the activity is for commercial transport purposes. One of the pioneers in Africa’s electric motorcycle sector, fittingly, started in Uganda! I have been following developments in the African electric mobility sector for about a decade now and every time I get an update on what’s going on somewhere on the continent, I get so excited, as it gives us an insight into how much progress has been made over the past couple of decades. Having been on the ground and speaking with founders of hundreds of electric mobility startups and other firms all over the African continent, I always feel confident to say that the transition to electric mobility in Africa will happen a whole lot faster than most people realize. That’s because it has been developed by locally-based companies tackling real pain points and everyday problems faced by public operators and other stakeholders that make up their key target market — all developed from the ground up without much in terms of government subsidies like we’ve seen in other developed markets around the world. Uganda-basedZembowas one of the startups that kickstarted the electric motorcycle taxi revolution on the African continent. Zembo started with an initial pilot phase from 2017 to around 2020. Zembo then launched version 2.0 of its motorcycle and batteries from 2021, adding 30 swap stations. It is now working on expanding to over 2,000 active riders and over 80 battery charging and swap stations in 2025. We have a great update from Uganda on Zembo’s impact, a lovely example to show how far along the transition to electric is in Uganda.According to news coming from Uganda, Zembo’s electric motorcycles are contributing to record electrification numbers in the last-mile delivery sector for partners such as Glovo. Glovo recently celebrated a milestone of 5 years operating in Uganda. As part of the celebrations, Glovo opened a new headquarters in Kampala and highlighted that about 40% of Glovo’s couriers now ride electric and there are plans to raise this to even higher levels soon, which will have a big impact on their mission to reduce emissions. Already, Zembo’s fleet in general (including riders outside the partnership with Glovo) is contributing to lower carbon emissions. Zembo’s website says each Zembo bike avoids 1.5 MT of carbon emissions annually — 7.5 MT over the bike’s lifetime. To date, Zembo’s fleet has resulted in 2,195,945 kg CO₂ reduced, over 1,000 drivers powered, and these drivers have covered 37.9 million km. There is also a great financial incentive for the riders to switch to electric motorcycles, as riders can save up to $500 annually on operational and fuel costs. According to Zembo’s website, “Zembo’s lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries offer a range of up to 80 km on a single charge, providing the performance riders need for their daily work. Built with safe and stable LFP technology, these batteries are designed for years of reliable service. They are also among the most affordable options on the market, costing just UGX 6,000 (USD 1.65) per swap. Zembo’s network in Uganda currently features 30 stations strategically located across the country, with plans to double this number by next year. These stations are conveniently situated at popular fuel stations, ensuring easy accessibility for all riders.”Zembo adds that its motorcycles are designed to withstand diverse terrains, rough roads, and heavy usage associated with boda boda utilisation requirements. So, the birthplace of the boda boda electrification pioneered by players such as Zembo. Uganda is actually a great place for electrification of motorcycles, and vehicles in general. According to Uganda’s electricity regulatorERA, the country’s installed electricity generation capacity has been on an upward trend for over a decade. This has been driven by the commissioning of various renewable energy projects, mostly hydro generation projects. Notable ones over the past 5 years include the commissioning of Isimba (183 MW) and Karuma (600 MW) hydropower plants. By the end of Q2 2024, Uganda’s installed capacity had reached 2,048.1 MW, a 63.7% increase from 1,251 MW in 2019. This is pretty impressive. Uganda’s generation mix itself is quite clean. ERA says as of the second quarter 2024, renewable energy projects contributed 95% of all generation capacity of the total installed capacity (2,048.1 MW). Hydroelectricity had the largest share, accounting for 84%. That means a growing number of electric motorcycles in Uganda charge on a grid dominated by renewables. With maximum demand in Uganda hovering at about 1,000 MW, there is a lot of room to grow demand from the electric mobility sector to boost uptake of this excess capacity, ultimately boosting revenues for electricity generation firms. Energy purchases in Uganda by the various consumers were just over 6,000 GWh at the end of 2023, driven mostly by large industries and residential consumers. Zembo is playing a key role in Uganda’s clean mobility sector. “Powered by renewable energy: Wherever Zembo operates, we rely on renewable energy sources to power our bikes. In Uganda — where 96% of electricity comes from renewables — Zembo utilizes the abundant waters of the River Nile to drive sustainable mobility solutions.” Remeredzai Joseph Kuhudzai has been fascinated with batteries since he was in primary school. As part of his High School Physics class he had to choose an elective course. He picked the renewable energy course and he has been hooked ever since.

      "full_text": "Last Updated on:26th August 2025, 04:23 am Washington, D.C. —On Friday, the Trump Administration issued a stop work order to the Revolution Wind project in Rhode Island. The project is already 80 percent completed—with 45 of its 65 wind turbines already installed—and once completed, Revolution Wind would harness enough offshore wind to power350,000 homesin Rhode Island and Connecticut. The project has created1,200 stable, well-paying jobsin the region, and would continue to support more job opportunities as the project develops. In April, the administrationissueda similar stop work order, demanding the Empire Wind project in New York to halt construction. The order was quicklyreversedafter advocacy from Sierra Club and other environmental organizations, New York Governor Kathy Hochul, and residents who demanded the project to resume so the state can access cheaper and more reliable energy. In response, Sierra Club Climate Policy Director Patrick Drupp issued the following statement: “We have a hot tip for Donald Trump: if you’re worried about the rising costs Americans are facing, stop cutting off the cheapest form of energy. Offshore wind has the potential to reliably and affordably power millions of homes across our country, but Donald Trump would rather take this option away from Americans to bolster business for fossil fuels. We will fight back against this attempt to raise costs for our communities.” The Sierra Club is America’s largest and most influential grassroots environmental organization, with millions of members and supporters. In addition to protecting every person’s right to get outdoors and access the healing power of nature, the Sierra Club works to promote clean energy, safeguard the health of our communities, protect wildlife, and preserve our remaining wild places through grassroots activism, public education, lobbying, and legal action.

      "full_text": "Application Period Opens for Annual Marine Energy and Hydropower Competitions, Which Challenge College Students To Find Real-World Solutions and Explore Career Pathways Calling all student innovators looking to make waves in the water power sector! The application windows for theHydropower Collegiate Competition(HCC) andMarine Energy Collegiate Competitionare now open. Submissions will be accepted through Sept. 19, 2025. Managed by NREL and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’sWater Power Technologies Office(WPTO), the competitions empower collegiate teams to solve complex marine energy and hydropower challenges for a chance to win cash prizes. “These competitions are designed to find solutions for real energy challenges,” said Elise DeGeorge, NREL’s lead project manager for HCC. “By offering hands-on experience and industry connections, the competitions can open doors and help students gain insight into the expansive career opportunities in water power.” Roughly one quarter of the U.S. hydropower workforce is nearing retirement, and HCC helps pave the way for a new generation of innovators and entrepreneurs who want to advance hydropower technologies, make connections, learn from mentors, and discover a career path in hydropower. The HCC 2026 competition, administered by NREL, aims to address hydropower challenges and explore opportunities using real-world concept development experiences. Teams must select from three development themes: in-conduit, non-powered dam, and pumped storage hydropower systems. The competition, which culminates in the spring of 2026 with a presentation of hydropower concepts to a panel of industry experts, consists of five required challenges and one optional challenge. Up to 15 teams will be selected to compete for cash prizes. Teams that participate in all required challenges will be eligible for up to $15,000 each in cash awards and will compete for part of the $20,000 grand prize cash pool. Teams that compete in the optional challenge will each be eligible for an additional $5,000 cash prize. With technology advancements, marine energy can power applications like autonomous vehicles for ocean exploration, battery and fuel cell technology for marine transportation, and water treatment for coastal and island communities. MECC empowers student teams to help shape the future of marine energy by developing solutions for coastal and maritime markets. MECC teams will compete to solve challenges and gain experience in the emerging marine energy industry. The 2026 MECC has two distinct participation leagues: The competition offers six challenges, including four scored challenges and two optional unscored challenges. The Megawatt League must compete in all four scored challenges, and the Kilowatt League can select from a combination of scored challenges. “Today’s college students will shape tomorrow’s marine energy technologies,” said Arielle Cardinal, NREL lead project manager for MECC. “We’re excited to help them kick off their plans for the future by providing a platform for designing, developing, and testing actual marine energy technology.” Up to 30 teams will be selected to compete for cash prizes. Each league, Kilowatt and Megawatt, offers a separate award pool. Teams that complete all required challenges will each be eligible to receive up to $5,000 in cash awards per submission package. Teams that successfully participate in all required challenges will also be eligible to compete for the grand prize award of up to $20,000. Undergraduate and graduate students from postsecondary institutions—including colleges, universities, community colleges, and trade schools—are invited to apply for both competitions.Applications do not require initial research or engineering.

      "full_text": "In this summary, I wanted to dive into one of the most exciting Tesla events that I’ve attended — the world’s highest Tesla light show, held on August 23, 2025, atop Pikes Peak in Colorado. As someone who’s followed Tesla’s community-driven spectacles for years, this one stood out not just for its altitude but for the sheer coordination and enthusiasm involved. Organized by the Denver Tesla Owners Club, it brought together over 200 Tesla vehicles to set a new Guinness World Record at an elevation of 14,115 feet. It was well organized and I was pleasantly surprised there was no hint of a protest or any negative vibes, making it a testament to electric vehicle resilience in extreme conditions. As night fell on the summit, the Teslas lined up along the winding roads, their headlights, taillights, and even some custom LED setups syncing in a mesmerizing display. The thin air and biting cold posed challenges, yet the batteries held strong, with no reports of significant range loss despite the high altitude. Videos circulating on social media show the lights pulsing to music, creating patterns that lit up the mountain like a futuristic aurora borealis. I took pictures and videos. I’ve included the best photos below. The videos didn’t hold a candle to the video above, so I recommend you watch that to get an idea of the overall show. At first, the club was worried they wouldn’t get enough people to sign up, but in the end, the event was sold out and people were clamoring for tickets. I forgot to secure my ticket in time, but luckily, Jon from Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley had an extra ticket for me. I rode to the event in a black Cybertruck withDanfrom Fort Collins. He picked me up on his trip to Pikes Peak after assisting three vehicles that ran out of electricity (intentionally) while on a range test. One participant posted on X, “Time to set the world record,” capturing the buildup. Another exclaimed, “Highest Tesla Light Show in the world baby!” as the event unfolded. Local news outlets — seehereandhere— covered it from below, describing the glowing spectacle visible for miles. It’s events like these that highlight Tesla’s appeal beyond just transportation — they’re about community and pushing boundaries. For EV enthusiasts, it’s a reminder of how these vehicles perform in real-world extremes, from sub-zero temps to low oxygen levels that could strain traditional engines. Looking ahead, this record might inspire more high-altitude adventures, perhaps even integrating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving tech for automated light patterns. If you’re in Colorado or planning a Tesla road trip, events like this show why the EV community thrives. All in all, the Pikes Peak light show wasn’t just a flash in the pan; it’s a shining example of innovation meeting adventure. I don’t know if this event did much to get more people in electric vehicles, but anything that gets the media to mention the amazing capabilities of the “computers on wheels” in a positive manner could plant the seed in some people’s minds and encourage them to think of them next time they need a new vehicle.

      "full_text": "Last Updated on:25th August 2025, 04:21 pm Recently, DJI (the company already well-known for its drones) sent us a new product to test out: theDJI Power 2000, a power station with 2048 Wh of energy storage. While we’ve tested a number of power stations with this much storage and far more, there are a few things that really set DJI’s new offering apart from the competition. In this article, I’ll share what makes it special and how it worked for me on a 4,500-mile camping trip across the United States. The first thing I noticed after unboxing the power station was just how compact it is. Despite having the storage it does, it’s not much bigger than a deep cycle RV battery. Even more important than size is shape, and with the simple rectangular arrangement DJI came up with, it’s easy to pack other things around it and on top of it. The handles are arranged not only for easy carry, but also to keep things from covering up the air vents, which prevents overheating when it’s packed away with other gear in a car or a closet. A power station could be the most awesome thing since sliced bread, but if it doesn’t have the right plug for the things YOU want to power, what good is it? So, let’s talk about what you can plug into this one. On the AC side, the Power 2000 has three 20-amp 120-volt plugs and one 30-amp TT-30 plug (like many RVs plug into). Maximum output, per DJI, is 3000 watts, so you can run a number of appliances at a time with no problem. More on that in a bit. The power station also has a number of USB-C and USB-A plugs for directly charging a number of small appliances, laptops, tablets, phones, and anything else that’s USB-powered. It also has two proprietary input-output SDC ports that you can plug a variety of things into, provided you get the right adapter or harness from DJI. Extra batteries to expand storage, solar inputs, rapid charging input, car charging, and fast charging for some recent DJI drones can all be accomplished. It also has an input port to charge the device directly from a wall socket, with two speed settings to adjust power levels on non-dedicated circuits. An app is available for iOS and Android devices to manage the power station, but as with other DJI Android apps, the APK must be directly downloaded. I already have a much larger bank of batteries mounted inside my travel trailer, so the Power 2000 served in a backup and auxiliary role on this trip. But, it came in very handy when I realized that I had forgotten my extension cord for my impact driver. Despite the bursts of energy an impact can suddenly draw, the Power 2000 coped just fine when I used it extend the stabilizers a lot further down than usual to accommodate a strange campsite configuration at Great Smoky Mountains’ Elkmont Campground. Next, I pulled out my travel trailer’s 30-amp connection to see if the 3 kW rating DJI promised was legitimate. I ran an air conditioner, house-sized refrigerator, and lighting for 2 hours, along with short bursts of the microwave and other appliances. Even as the full pull approached 2900 watts, the power station gave no errors and revealed no hidden “gotchas.” DJI delivers on its promise. My next bit of testing for the unit was entirely unplanned. While I was using it to cool off the camper and cook dinner, a pretty strong thunderstorm drifted into the area. I’m a big believer in “When thunder roars, go indoors.” I know I’m picky, but I’m just not a big fan of helping the sky and the earth balance our their electrical imbalances, at least not if my body’s going to serve as the conductor. So, the unit got to sit outside for about an hour of fairly heavy rain, wind, and splashing mud. But, it still took about another hour before the power station shut off, and only then because we had depleted the battery. The total runtime with the AC, fridge, lights, and limited microwave use was about 2 hours. If you’re looking for a power station that can handle heavy loads, is easy to pack/store, and can survive things you’re likely to encounter on camping trips, the DJI Power 2000 is a good choice. Even around the house, it should serve well to cope with power outages. Heck, if you add some extra batteries (up to 22528 Wh), you could use it to run air conditioning and heat at least part-time. The pricing isn’t bad, either. According to theDJI website, the normal price is $1899, but as of this writing, it’s available for $1299. Purchase the Power 2000 fromdji.comorAmazon.

      "full_text": "CleanTechnicahas published hundreds of articles on renewable energy and battery storage, but we have not always thoroughly explored how those advances will alter societies that take advantage of them. Predicting the future accurately is impossible. If we could do so, there would be no need for sporting contests, as the result of games would be known in advance. But by paying close attention to small developments, we sometimes can get a glimpse of what the future might be. One of our regular readers — Bryan FW — recently posted a comment on aCleanTechnicaarticle that seemed particularly insightful. He wrote: “The evolution here, once battery packs became cheap enough and ubiquitous enough, is that those consumers with the most resources will exit the grid first. Those remaining will become increasingly riskier as paying customers, creating either lower utility profits or government intervention where government increasingly subsidizes utilities until it becomes effectively the single payer for those remaining (except in libertarian states, of course, where people who can’t pay have to go back to the nineteenth century). “Either utility profits go away, or grid improvements halt. I think we can all guess which….The concept of moving electrons over great distance becomes obsolete. No more efficiencies of scale, no more fungible electricity markets, no more grand vision of harvesting the sun as it moves across the continent. “And that’s not necessarily a bad thing. With that decrease in efficiency comes a corresponding increase in redundancy. Ransomware or enemy action or natural disaster may take down microgrids here and there, but we just won’t be seeing these widespread failures that are so difficult and costly to deal with anymore. Globalization is the past; islanding is the future.” His words may be prescient. There have been lots of headlines this week about how cheap solar panels imported from China have transformed life for many in Pakistan. Where previously the electricity provided by traditional power generators and distributed via a creaky energy grid was expensive and unreliable, now many Pakistanis are simply exiting the electricity market and taking responsibility for their own energy needs. A report byEnergy Monitordated August 20, 2025, says that Pakistan imported 17 GW of solar PV and an estimated 1.25 GWh of lithium-ion battery packs in 2024. The expectations are that by 2030, battery imports could increase to 8.75 GWh, which would be enough to meet over a quarter of peak demand. Solar by day, storage by night would become the new norm for the country. “The surge in solar and batteries is not only driving down energy costs for Pakistani users but also enhancing reliability and contributing to the country’s energy sovereignty by reducing dependence on imported fuels,”Energy Monitorsays. There are bumps in the road, however. The transformation “poses new challenges for grid resilience and system integration. The rapid growth of distributed energy is creating a divide between grid-dependent users and those who can afford off-grid solutions such as rooftop solar and batteries.” That is pretty much what Bryan FW predicted in his comment. Energy Monitoradds, “Pakistan’s energy transition underscores the need for utility-scale solar projects to complement rooftop and distributed systems, essential for meeting growing demand and facilitating the transition. Financing solutions must cater to all segments of the population to ensure that the rapid shift to solar and storage benefits the entire power system.” “Other emerging economies can draw valuable insights from Pakistan’s experience. Recommendations include making the energy transition inclusive, integrating distributed energy into the system, including legacy assets, incorporating the mobility sector, and planning ahead for scale.” A careful reader might fairly conclude that the energy transition could be messy — something common to most technology revolutions. It is worth noting that theWashington Postran a story with a headline that focused on the impact this solar revolution will have on Pakistanis who cannot afford solar and storage systems and are burdened by higher energy costs. The headline — “How Pakistan’s solar energy boom led to higher power bills for the poor” — may be accurate, but its emphasis seems designed to appeal to the MAGAverse first and foremost, something the Jeff Bezos-owned newspaper has made its primary editorial policy since January 20. AsCleanTechnicareported last year, in November, 2024, theWorld Economic Forumsaid that Pakistan’s rapid adoption of solar power, which is being driven primarily by market forces and with only minimal political support, provides valuable lessons for other emerging markets. “Declining solar panel prices, coupled with skyrocketing grid electricity tariffs that have increased by 155% over three years, are fueling a rush in renewable energy adoption in Pakistan, with solar power leading the way. The country is now the world’s sixth-largest solar market,” it said. The driving force behind the surge in solar power in Pakistan is economics, not policies. Many countries feel threatened by China’s overproduction of solar panels, which has driven down their cost to the point where they are ridiculously cheap. As a result, Pakistan is now the third largest importer of Chinese-made solar panels. If Pakistan had its own solar panel industry, it would impose significant import duties on those panels from China, but it does not. Therefore, the influx of cheap panels is welcomed by most Pakistanis, but not all. Industrial, agricultural, and residential sectors have embraced solar, with imported Chinese modules totaling 13 GW added in the first half of 2024. Forecasters predicted that figure wouldrise to 22 GWby end of 2024. Kaiser Bengali, an economist who worked as an adviser to the chief minister of Pakistan’s southeastern Sindh province, saysthe influx of Chinese panelshas sparked an episode of “circular debt” where those still reliant on the expensive state power grid need to choose between saving money to switch to solar or refusing to pay their bills. If they choose the latter, it could spark a cascade of unpaid debts. Consumption of electricity from the national grid fell by 10% in 2023 compared to the previous year amid rising electricity prices, and this decrease could deepen as Islamabad faces pressure to increase electricity prices in order to repay a loan from the International Monetary Fund. Part of the problem is the inability of the national grid to deliver a stable supply of electricity. The International Energy Agency reports that Pakistan’sper capitaelectricity consumption grew by 87% between 2000 and 2022, yet more than 40 million people remain without access to electricity and half the population still lacks clean cooking facilities. Many more live in off-grid or under-served areas, without access to electricity for more than 4 hours a day. Meanwhile, record-breaking heat waves are boosting demand for basic cooling from fans and air conditioners. Here we see the importance of Bryan FW’s comments. Upsetting the status quo will have important economic and policy considerations for Pakistan and not everyone will be a winner. But the path ahead seems clear. There are many countries that do not have stable electrical grids and who must import oil, coal, or LNG to power their generating stations. Now there is a way to leapfrog over all those issues, just as cell phones leapfrogged over issues associated with telephone networks that depended on wires. The world is on the cusp of a clean energy revolution that will undo much of what is considered normal in electricity generation and distribution. You can spot the changes if you look carefully. The new watchwords will be resiliency and self sufficiency — concepts that strike fear into the hearts of traditional utility companies. But the result will be more people who have direct control over their own personal energy supply either through self-generation or through reliance onlocal microgrids. We once thought New York City would be powered by clean energy imported from California, but now we see that in reality, it will be powered by locally produced electricity that is created during the day and distributed at night, thanks to energy storage technologies that are just now making their presence felt on a meaningful level. We don’t know for sure that Bryan FW’s crystal ball is completely accurate, but there are signs that his vision iswell on its way to fruition. The traditional model for how electricity is created and distributed was created in the 19th century. That model is rapidly become obsolete, thanks to renewables. There’s a bright new day coming and we can’t wait for it to arrive!

      "full_text": "Last weekend, the future was on display in Bogota. From August 21stto 24th, a small EV exposition was hosted in Bogotá’sCarrera Mall,calledExpoferia of EVs and HEVs(not very creative, I know).On Sunday, lacking anything better to do, I decided to stop by to check what was new on the block. And what I saw convinced me Colombia is now past the tipping point in its path towards electrification. First of all, it waspacked(if the pictures don’t look like it, it’s because I tried to get as few people in them as possible). I had issues getting the attention of every single representative I tried to speak with, every one of them being busy and with a couple more people waiting. And I couldn’t get into a single car. This is relevant insofar as the event was organized by a small vehicle/taxi company in their small mall, located in an otherwise not commonly visited area of Bogota. Second, the event included “EVs and hybrids,” but the event was some 85% BEVs and 10% PHEVs, with HEVs accounting for just a handful of models (the Ford Escape and Maverick HEV were there). This is despite HEV sales accounting for more than double EV sales in the country. And third, the event cemented the arrival of an array of affordable EVs that have landed in the country since June, including the Chery ICar 03, the Dongfeng Friday, the JAC E30X, the Deepal S05, and the GAC Aion V. More segments are getting wider availability, and the EV ecosystem now caters to a far larger array of tastes. Besides these models, the event presented the newly arrived Geely Riddara (Radar) pickup, a couple of electric taxis which are now at price parity with their ICEV counterparts, and a wide array of micromobility alternatives, some of which are capable and quite affordable. Oh, and the Xiaomi SU7 was also on display. Legacy automakers were also present in the event, with Chevrolet’s Blazer and Equinox EV, the aforementioned Ford Maverick and Escape HEV, the Kia EV5, and the Hyundai Kona. Honestly, the Equinox EV is quite a beautiful car, and it’s a shame it now costs $7,500 more than the EV5, as otherwise it would probably be leading its segment. But what I found more relevant from the event was the pre-sale of the GAC Aion UT, a capable hatchback with a 44kWh battery which will arrive at Seagull pricing — that is, COP$81,000,000 (USD$20,100). Thisfinallyopens the B hatchback segment to price parity, putting pressure both on similar cars that are currently more expensive (JAC E30X) and on city-cars that offer less for a similar cost (BYD Seagull, Renault Kwid E-Tech, JAC E10X). GAC is not as important a brand as BYD is, so we’ll have to wait to see if there’s a cascade of discounts (as happened when the Seagull first arrived), or if the impact will be felt more slowly. But regardless, the winds of change are here. The explosive growth in 2024 made many of us impatient as market share stopped rising and kept hovering around 8% throughout the last 8 months. But with the interest EVs are harnessing, and with the arrival of so many options in varied segments, I expect it will not take long for Colombia to start another rapid trend of growth and surpass 10% in the next few months, and perhaps 15% by the first half of next year. What do you guys think? Am I being too optimistic here? EDIT: Hopefully, this makes it to the final version. Just in: according to local media, the event was such a success thatExpoferiawill now become an annual exposition. Passionate for all things Latin American, I’ve been closely following the energy and mobility transitions since they started to become present south of the equator.

      "full_text": "I’ve been seeing more and more electric bikes on the roads and sidewalks near my home. I’ve been a fan of electric bikes for years, because they help more people get outside and exercise. They’re also fun to use and extend the range of places people feel comfortable biking. However, the gold standard, the biggest aim of electric bikes, has to be replacing car trips with more bike trips. And that’s been my question — how much are ebike trips replacing car trips, versus how much are they replacing normal fully human-powered bike trips? I have seen some people ebiking recently who were clearly doing so for utilitarian purposes — with a backpack of tennis rackets on their back, with groceries in the basket, or on other transportation trips. This brought that question above back to mind. With the electric bike market growing and growing, are people starting to use these ebikes for normal transportation more and more? Another thing that got me thinking about this is that Lectric eBikes has pointed out that theLectric XP 3.0 ebikeis the 3rd best selling EV in the US, only trailing the Tesla Model Y and Tesla Model 3. Lectric also just launched theXP 4.0, its most advanced model yet, designed to build on that momentum. It’s actually a pet peeve of mine when people assume EV only stands for “electric car,” because it’s much broader than that and covers all kinds of electric vehicles. However, it was still a bit of an eye opener to see Lectric frame it like that — and rightly so! If the Lectric XP 3.0 ebike is the 3rd best selling EV model in the USA, it is. And many of those riders will be biking for transportation rather than taking a car. Searching around, I can’t find great statistics definitively showing how much more people are using ebikes for transportation rather than using cars (or normal bikes, for that matter). Most of the research I’m finding is from several years ago, but much of the general narrative from the past few years is that people started biking, especially ebiking, much more during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the point is that ebikes do enable more, further biking for a lot of people, which makes it more feasible for them to ditch the car and bike instead. “Recent research from Portland State University found that e-bikes encourage new people to ride, gets those who already ride to ride more often, and people feel safer when riding e-bikes than standard bikes. E-bikes are replacing car trips as well. Results indicated that e-bike rides replaced 1,778 motor vehicle miles (average of 9.3 miles per trip) just within the last three trips reported by respondents,”PeopleForBikeswrites. Laka, a UK-based bike insurance company, writes that, “Among the major reasons for riding e-bikes are replacing car trips, improving fitness, and riding with less effort.“ The fact that the top reason for riding an ebike according to the data above is to replace car trips does tell us that ebikes are making a big difference. Here’s more on from eBicycles.com: So, yes, ebikes are actually replacing car trips. How much so depends on the data source, but it’s clear people are ebiking instead of driving thanks to the corebenefits of an ebike. All those Lectric ebike sales aren’t in place of Tesla Model 3 sales or Toyota Corolla sales, but some of them are! Zach is tryin' to help society help itself one word at a time.

      "full_text": "Москва. 3 сентября. INTERFAX.RU - Молдавские компании, летом победившие в тендере на строительство ВИЭ, ввели в эксплуатацию парк солнечных электростанций на 60 МВт, сообщило Минэнерго Молдавии. \"Все фотоэлектрические станции, разработанные инвесторами, победившими на первом аукционе на получение статуса крупного квалифицированного производителя, официально введены в эксплуатацию\", - говорится в сообщении ведомства. В июне этого года Минэнерго определило ряд молдавских компаний (названия не уточняются), которые построят объекты ВИЭ-генерации на 165 МВт, в том числе солнечные электростанции на 60 МВт, ветровые - на 105 МВт. Минэнерго также сообщило, что в августе правительство официально предоставило инвесторам статус квалифицированного крупного производителя, что позволило им заключить с госкомпанией Energocom гарантированные договоры купли-продажи электроэнергии сроком на 15 лет. Цены на электроэнергию от ВИЭ, определенные по итогам аукциона, являются одними из самых конкурентных в портфеле Energocom: 59,1 евро за 1 МВт.ч за солнечную энергию, 67,2 евро за 1 МВт.ч - за ветроэнергетику. По оценке Минэнерго, после ввода в эксплуатацию солнечных установок их доля в годовом потреблении электроэнергии в Молдавии составит около 8,4%. Ожидается, что после первого года эксплуатации доля электроэнергии из возобновляемых источников в конечном потреблении достигнет 30%. Частные инвестиции в создание ВИЭ на 165 МВт составляют около 190 млн евро. По данным Минэнерго, на конец июля общая установленная мощность ВИЭ-генерации достигла 784,09 МВт, что на 204,7 МВт больше, чем на конец 2024 года. В 2024 году ВИЭ-генерация Молдавии выработала 691 тыс. МВт.ч электроэнергии, что составило 16,7% годового потребления.",

      "full_text": "В мире продолжается гонка эффективности тандемных солнечных элементов, изготовленных с использованием перовскитов. Правда, пока эти изделия не применяются в солнечной энергетике, однако лабораторные результаты, демонстрируемые десятком известных производителей, дают надежду на коммерциализацию технологии. Тандемные ячейки, состоящие из монокристаллического кремния и перовскитных материалов, имеют теоретический предел эффективности около 43 процентов, что намного превышает возможности обычных однопереходных кремниевых солнечных элементов, составляющих основу современной солнечной энергетики. Компания Huasun Energy, крупный китайский производитель гетероструктурных (HJT) модулей, сообщила о «двух прорывах» в области тандемных солнечных элементов на основе кристаллического кремния с гетеропереходом (HJT) и перовскита. Эффективность крошечного (1 см²) «лабораторного» солнечного элемента достигла 34,02%, а крупногабаритного (210 мм) элемента в стандартных производственных условиях – 29,01%. Второй результат почти на 4% выше, чем у современных стандартных однопереходных кристаллических кремниевых солнечных элементов. Huasun утверждает, что «этот прорыв стал возможным благодаря собственной технологии нанесения крупнотекстурных тонких пленок, которая обеспечивает равномерное покрытие на сложных поверхностях и решает ключевые проблемы масштабирования перовскитных материалов. Внедрив органические стабилизаторы, Huasun улучшила равномерность осаждения и устойчивость к воздействию окружающей среды, а новые материалы для межфазного транспорта повысили надежность и совместимость технологических процессов. В совокупности эти достижения значительно приближают тандемные элементы к массовому производству». Производитель говорит, что «как только эффективность тандема превысит 30%, стоимость солнечной энергии может упастьниже одного цента США за ватт, открывая путь к конкурентоспособным по стоимости зеленому водороду и накоплению энергии» [вероятно, Huasun имеет ввиду эффективность серийных тандемных продуктов, а что касается стоимости солнечной энергии, непонятно, о чем речь; стоимость обычных ячеек составляет сегодня в Китае более четырех центов США за ватт]. В июне текущего года Trina Solarпредставилатандемный солнечный модуль мощностью 841 ватт с эффективностью 27,1%. Также в июне LONGiобъявилаоб эффективности преобразования тандемного солнечного элемента из кристаллического кремния и перовскита «большой площади» (260,9 см2) в 33%, что явилось «мировым рекордом» (для тандемных ячеек большой площади). В апреле LONGiобъявилао новом мировом рекорде эффективности преобразования энергии тандемного солнечного элемента из перовскита и кремния — 34,85% (речь идёт о малом лабораторном образце). Это только некоторые последние результаты — в этой области идёт постоянное движение. Не исключаю, что тандемная технология найдет коммерческое применение. Ваша поддержка очень важна для существования и развития RenEn, ведущего русскоязычного Интернет-сайта в области «новой энергетики». Помогите, чем можете, пожалуйста.

      "full_text": "Philippine telecommunications giant Globe is set to transition over 3,000 of its cell sites and other low-energy facilities in Metro Manila and the CALABARZON region to 100% renewable energy by 2028. This significant expansion of its clean energy portfolio is being enabled by the country’s Retail Aggregation Program (RAP), a policy framework that allows companies to bundle the power demands of multiple small sites to procure electricity from a single retail supplier. This initiative marks the first time a telecommunications company in the Philippines has utilized the RAP framework at this scale. It represents a strategic step beyond previous clean energy sourcing methods and provides a model for how large enterprises with geographically distributed infrastructure can effectively access the renewable energy market. The transition is projected to source 80 million kilowatt-hours of clean electricity annually. Initiated by the Philippine Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), the Retail Aggregation Program is a key enabler for this large-scale transition. For a company like Globe, whose network consists of thousands of sites with individual energy needs too small to qualify for other programs, RAP is a game-changer. “We are grateful to the ERC for listening to our challenges. With RAP, we are able to address the urgent need to reduce emissions at scale,” said Yoly Crisanto, Globe’s Chief Sustainability and Corporate Communications Officer. “By expanding our sourcing of renewable energy to thousands of additional sites, we are taking deliberate steps toward our Net Zero goals and proving that clean energy is not only viable but necessary across all operational levels.” The shift of these 3,000+ sites is expected to reduce Globe’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by an estimated 5.5 million kilograms of CO₂ equivalent (5,500 metric tons) each year. This directly supports the company’s commitments under the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which include a target to achieve a 42% reduction in absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2030 and a long-term goal to reduce absolute emissions across all scopes by 90% by 2050, using 2021 as a baseline. The collaboration with energy supplier ACEN RES highlights a broader corporate strategy within their parent company, the Ayala Group. “This collaboration with Globe reflects the strength of synergies across the Ayala group in driving meaningful climate action,” commented Irene Maranan, ACEN SVP and Head for Communications & Sustainability. “By enabling the shift of over 3,000 sites to renewable energy, we are not only accelerating Globe’s Scope 2 emissions reduction, but also advancing our collective net zero ambition as a group.” The move also aligns with the Philippine Department of Energy’s national target of increasing the share of renewables in the country’s energy mix to 35% by 2030 and 50% by 2040.

      "full_text": "Last Updated on:3rd September 2025, 12:05 am With the untimely death of the EV tax credit looming just a few weeks away on September 30, General Motors is among the US automakers celebrating a last-minute EV sales bonanza. The celebrating will most likely dissolve into tears come October. Nevertheless, GM has made it clear that EVs are here to stay, and the company’s head of North America operations has just explained how they expect to weather the coming storm. GM has hadgreat funwith its status asthe #2 EV sellerin the US over the past couple of years, topped only by longtime industry leader Tesla. The fun continued into August, when GM added up the numbers to total sales of21,000 EVsfrom its Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC branches combined. “August was our best month everfor EV sales — and we expect that buying surge to pay long-term dividends,” notes Duncan Aldred, Senior VP and President of GM North America. “GM remains the #2 EV seller, driven by strong demand for vehicles like the Chevrolet Equinox EV, the Cadillac LYRIQ, and the GMC Sierra EV,” he added, in an article posted on the company’s website on September 2. In the same post, Aldred dropped a hint about why the company is confident in the long-term staying power of the EV market, citing “EV customers’ overwhelming commitment to the technology.” That’s shorthand for surveys that show that most EV drivers will stick with an EV for their next vehicle. Somewhat oddly, none other than Shell recently surveyed EV drivers in Europe, the US, and China. “Signalling a strong commitment tothe transition towards electric mobility, nine in ten (91%) current EV drivers (both Battery EVs and Plug-in Hybrid EVs) indicate they would consider another EV as their next vehicle,” Shell noted. Aldred also took note of GM’s track record on manufacturer loyalty, referring to the likelihood that anyone who buys from GM will come back around to GM the next time they need another vehicle. That’s not just GM’s opinion. In February, the company gave itself a pat on the back for earning the Highest Overall Manufacturer Loyalty award from S&P Global Mobility for the 10th consecutive year in 2024. “For a decade now,if you drive a GM vehicle, you’re more likely to stick with our brands than to go to a competitor when you buy your next ride,” GM emphasized. That’s all well and good, but the loss of the $7,500 federal tax credit is going to sting. In the same blog post, Aldred affirmed that GM is cutting back on EV production in anticipation of a near-term drop in EV sales after September 30. However, Duncan also emphasized that GM intends to ride out the storm. He notes that the company was seeing its EV sales on the upswing before the tax credit came into being as a provision of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which he attributes to GM’s focus on the affordability end of the EV market as well as the luxury end. All else being equal, the company expects to see sales continue in those categories, through the company’s high-end Cadillac EVs along with the Chevrolet Equinox and the forthcoming rebirth of the affordable Chevy Bolt. If all goes according to plan, Duncan also expects more and more sales from the company’s Chevrolet, GMC, and Hummer pickup trucks and SUVs. That remains to be seen, but GM also has a trump card to play, so to speak. If more people don’t want to buy more EVs over the coming months, that’s just fine with GM. “As we adjust to the new EV market realities, the strength of our ICE portfolio will continue to separate our brands from the pack and give us flexibility and profitability that EV-only companies lack,” Duncan notes. Hmm … who is he referring to? Duncan’s comments about EV-only companies seem directed mainly at small-scale startups, but Tesla also comes in for its share of ribbing. “Meanwhile, we are seeing marginal competitors dramatically scale back their products and plans, which should end much of the overproduction and irrational discounts we’ve seen in the marketplace,” Aldred wrote, most likely referring toTesla’s Cybertruck debacle. Thediscountingtrend over at Tesla surfaced last year, when signs of weakness in the company’s sales began to surface.The discountscontinued into this year as sales began to slide off a cliff. Still, GM and other automakers have a long hill to climb if they will ever catch up to Tesla on EV sales. Despite Tesla’s ongoingbrand reputation crisis, the company still accounted foralmost 50%of all EV sales in the US in Q2 of this year. “With almost 144,000 sales, Tesla had more than four times as many sales as #2 Chevrolet,”CleanTechnicaeditor Zachary Shahan observed on August 31, adding that “Ford and Hyundai are in a tight race for #3, with 5.5% and 5.3% share of the US EV market, respectively.” GM’s optimistic outlook on the strength of long-term EV sales is somewhat tempered by an apparent plateauing of interest among the general car-buying public. “EV share of the overall US auto marketdropped to 7.4% in the second quarter, down year over year from 8.1% in Q2 2024, and also down quarter over quarter from 7.6% in Q1 2025…7.4% EV market share is the worst its been since Q1 2024 when the share was 7.2%,”CleanTechnicanoted on September 1. That tracks with the aforementioned Shell survey. In contrast to the high number of EV drivers who look forward to their next EV purchase, Shell found that more ICE drivers were less inclined to try out an EV. Persistent gaps in public EV charging availability as well as shortcomings in the public charging experience can take part of the blame. GM sees that hurdle melting away. “By the end of the year, our customers will have access to more than 65,000 public fast-charging bays across the country. We expect that will grow to more than 80,000 by the end of next year and 100,000 by the end of 2027 — a more than 50% improvement in just three years,” Aldred wrote, citing the EVGo andIONNAfast charging networks as well as its own GM Energy branch. With affordability top of mind, GM also expects new low-costLFP (lithium iron phosphate) batteriesto sustain its long-term EV sales profile into the future, regardless of the shifting winds of federal electrification policy. After all, EV technology isn’t going anywhere, but US presidents come and go every 4–8 years. Meanwhile, GM has been around since 1908.

      "full_text": "Tobias Alando is right:localization is key if Kenya is to unlock the full promise of electric mobility. The EV sector is not a theoretical opportunity anymore — it is here, and it aligns with three urgent national priorities: creating jobs, improving public health, and strengthening the fiscal base. But if we are to succeed, localization must be framed more broadly than just assembling vehicles. For nearly 40 years, the real disruptor of Kenya’s auto industry has been second-hand imports, now over 80% of the market. EVs are not the enemy — they are the lever to transform both our industrial and energy landscape. Every EV on the road consumes locally generated power for its entire lifetime, displacing imported fossil fuels that drain our foreign reserves. Kenya already generates over 90% of its electricity from renewable sources, with significant surplus capacity during off-peak hours. EV adoption can absorb that idle clean energy, spur new investment into green generation, and — critically — help lower energy costs for households, businesses, and manufacturers alike. In this sense, energy itself should be considered “local content.” The benefits extend beyond economics. Shifting even 10% of new vehicle registrations to EVs would sharply cut urban air pollution, reduce noise on our streets, and unlock consumer savings through lower operational costs. This is industrialization and environmental health working hand in hand. To truly compete, however,Kenyamust pivot assembly efforts toward areas where the opportunity curve is steepest — “chargers, battery packs, and key EV components.” These technologies are scalable, transferrable, and well-suited to building regional value chains. From there, we can graduate into low-volume commercial EVs and eventually passenger cars. Policy must align across three fronts: Kenya’s current competitive advantage is clear: we generate over 90% of our electricity from renewable sources. This is a foundation most countries envy. Add to that a youthful, educated population hungry for opportunity, and it’s evident that the path to prosperity lies in creating jobs — both formal and informal — anchored in affordable energy. For most of these jobs, the cost of electricity is the single biggest input. That is why, as we discuss “local content” in the automotive industry, we must broaden the definition. It cannot only be about parts and assembly. Renewable, locally generated power is itself local content. Let’s agree on this: importing Fully Built Units (FBUs) exports jobs to the source markets. But so too does importing fossil fuels. The critical difference is that every EV, whether locally assembled or imported fully built, runs on 100% locally generated power. That translates into local jobs not only in the auto sector, but also across manufacturing, services, and the wider economy. Here is the scale of what this means. Scenario B (medium) shows the potential within the next 5–7 years: Together, that is ~1.19 TWh annually, or about three times the energy Kenya currently curtails from its grid. After absorbing today’s wasted 300–400 GWh, EV growth would require 120–150 MW of new clean generation capacity. That’s not a burden, it’s an opportunity. EV adoption becomes the engine that pulls new geothermal, wind, and solar projects to market, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of cheaper energy and stronger industrial competitiveness. By treating “green energy as local content,” EVs give us a double win: they secure jobs in the automotive value chain while simultaneously anchoring new employment in energy, industry, and services. This is how localization and electrification, working together, can transform Kenya’s economy.

      "full_text": "Over the last year, we here atCleanTechnicahave been compiling survey data about rooftop solar installations. The analysis stage of our project is just beginning, but it’s clear from the get-go that rooftop solar owners want to share their experiences — to help others, but also to affirm that solar is a viable, reliable, and powerful source of energy for homes and businesses. As we start to digest the responses, one question is at the forefront of our minds: what makes people want to buy and install rooftop solar? What broad themes emerged from our survey about consumer motivation to install rooftop solar? Each householdhasits own particular primary goal as they investigate becoming rooftop solar owners. Take our friends, Ted and Nancy, whohave8 solar panels on the roof of their 1200-square-foot lake house in New Jersey, where they spend about 5 months of the year. Their rooftop solar motivation arose from the need to add electricity to their off-grid home, which is quite distinct from many consumers who have gone the solar route. For these NJ homeowners, the cost of installation wasn’t as important as the end results of electrical access. In ourCleanTechnicasurvey responses, financial savings and energy independence were two of the top reasons to invest in rooftop solar. Understanding the capitalization of solar installations into home values is especially interesting because adding a solar system is one of the most expensive changes homeowners can make. But that’s not the only cost that consumers take into account when considering rooftop solar for their home or business. The ability to save money was one of the primary reasons why our survey respondents said they had installed rooftop solar. Solar’s return on investment and drop in monthly bills was a strong motivator. According to the US Energy Information Administration, the average US electric bill is $132.17, based on data collected from 2023. Connecticuthasthe second highest electrical costs; only Hawai’i is higher. Perhaps that is why Connecticutstands outfor the state’s early effort to broaden access to rooftop solar, specifically to low- and moderate-income residents, through incentive projects under their Residential Solar Investment Program (RSIP). After implementation of the RSIP, participation in rooftop solar opened up to new communities, and that the median observed growth rate in rooftop solar adoption doubled throughout the state. Rooftop solar can reduce energy costs and, therefore, reduce energy burden. More and more homeowners are turning to solar power to reduce their carbon footprint and save on monthly electricity bills. But how much can you actually expect to save on electricity bills after installing solar panels? The average savings from solar panels varies, based on state electricity rates and other factors like average sun hours, usage, local incentives, location, system size, and electricity consumption. Data from EcoFlowpointsto an average residential solar array with a power output of 7.15 kW. Assuming an average of 4.5 peak sun hours per day, this system would have a daily production of 32.2 kWh and a monthly output of around 965 kWh. Considering the US average monthly electricity usage of 886 kWh, a 7.15 kW solar array would produce more than this and could save the average homeowner the pre-solar cost for electricity. The average US household can expect to save around $1,500 on their electricity bills annually. This estimate indicates that solar panels can provide significant long-term savings for homeowners. There’s another caveat that isn’t widely discussed. Solar power costs are stable for years, but utility prices frequently rise. Rooftop solar owners have confidence knowing that the cost to power their homes or businesses will not soar due to factors beyond their control. In ourCleanTechnicasurvey, respondents shared how important rooftop solar was for energy independence and self-sufficiency. Energy self-sufficiency is the capability to satisfy energy needs without depending on others. Most consumers yearn to attain a certain degree of self-sufficiency for energy security, and rooftop solarhas been widely identifiedas being critical to achieving such goals. Achieving complete energy independence through solar power is a powerful financial decision thattransformsa home into a self-sustaining entity. Contemporary solar technology, coupled with advanced battery storage systems, now makes it possible for home and business owners to generate, store, and manage their own electricity year-round. This shift away from traditional utility dependence offers more than just lower monthly bill; it provides protection against rising energy costs, power outages, and grid instability, while increasing property value. The ease of integration of this technology in the residential sector is a real advantage of this technology. So, too, is its high economic return compared to the level of risk: its profitabilityis directly proportionalto the cost of electricity. As a result, these rooftop solar installations have become extremely interesting to consumers, as their profitability increases when the cost of electricity rises. Indeed (excepting the US with the current anti-renewables Trump administration) the implications of strategic PV deployment for regional self-sufficiency by 2050are gainingtraction. Solar poweristhe fastest way and least expensive way to add more electricity to the nation’s electricity grid. The US solar industryadded8.6 gigawatts (GW) of new solar module manufacturing capacity in Q1 2025, marking the third-largest quarter for new manufacturing capacity on record. The development of complementary energy technologies such as vehicle-to-grid capability, smart homes, and battery energy storage systems has stimulated consumer awareness of the combined benefits of rooftop solar and other technologies. Some households adopt multiple sustainable energy technologies as part of a larger equation as they add rooftop solar, such as plug-in electric vehicles, battery energy storage systems, smart appliances, smart thermostats, and more. Most of these additions are phased in rather than installed concurrently. In the past 15 years, residential rooftop solarhas gonefrom a niche curiosity to a common sight in many neighborhoods around the US. For example, in the US states of Connecticut and Massachusetts, nearly 9% of all homes have solar. This is important because it means that residential solar now has the potential to influence housing markets. We’ll continue to explore the results of ourCleanTechnicasurvey over the next few weeks. Respondents offered a good deal of interesting information and commentary that we’ll share periodically. Stay tuned.

      "full_text": "Производство «чистой электроэнергии» в Индии выросло на 20% до новых максимумов с начала года, что дало энергетикам редкую возможность сократить производство электроэнергии на основе ископаемого топлива и снизить зависимость от импорта энергоносителей, сообщает Reuters со ссылкой на данные исследовательской компании Ember. За первую половину 2025 года индийские энергетические предприятия выработали рекордные 236 тераватт-часов (ТВт*ч) «чистой электроэнергии» (ВИЭ + АЭС). Это на 20% больше, чем за тот же период 2024 года, ипозволило генераторам сократить производство электроэнергии из ископаемого топлива на 4% по сравнению с предыдущим годом, до примерно 691 ТВт*ч. Основными факторами сталирост ветрогенерации на 29% (до 47,2 ТВт*ч) и солнечной генерации на 25% (до 85 ТВт*ч). Рекордная выработка индийской атомной энергетики (29 ТВт*ч) и рост выработки гидроэлектростанций на 14% по сравнению с прошлым годом также способствовали росту общего объема чистой электроэнергии. Что касается ископаемого топлива,выработка электроэнергии на угле снизилась на 3%по сравнению с предыдущим годом до 675 ТВт*ч, в то время как выработка электроэнергиина основе природного газасократилась на 34%до 13,75 ТВт*ч. В первой половине 2025 года общий объем чистой генерации из всех источников примерно на 24% превысил средний уровень за те же месяцы 2022-2024 гг. В июне доля чистой энергии в общем объеме генерации составила 31%, что стало самым высоким показателем за этот месяц и означало, что доля электроэнергии, вырабатываемой из ископаемого топлива, впервые опустилась ниже 70%. Данные о выработке электроэнергии в Индии в июле и августе еще не опубликованы, но, вероятно, доля чистой энергии в общем объеме генерации в этот период будет еще выше, поскольку в этот период выработка на основе ветра и гидроэлектростанций, как правило, достигает годовых пиков. Индияввела в стройрекордные 18 ГВт мощностей солнечной энергетики в первой половине 2025 года. Это указывает на дальнейший быстрый рост выработки на основе ВИЭ. Тем не менее, Индия планирует строить новые угольные ТЭС в целях «энергетической безопасности». Ожидается, что потребление электроэнергии в странебудет растина 6–6,5% в течение следующих пяти лет.

Мощность этого объекта составит до 3 ГВт в год, что позволит производить «зелёный» водород по конкурентоспособной, по мировым меркам, цене. Кроме того, компания планирует увеличить собственное производство водорода до 3 миллионов тонн в год Завод по производству солнечных панелей ужевведен в эксплуатацию. Он успешно выпустил первые высокоэффективные гетероструктурные (HJT) солнечные модули мощностью 200 МВт. «Эти модули демонстрируют лучшие в отрасли характеристики: на 10% выше выходная мощность, на 20% выше устойчивость к температурам и на 25% ниже деградация», — сообщил Амбани. RIL планирует в ближайшие кварталы увеличить годовую производственную мощность этого предприятия до 10 ГВт с последующим расширением до 20 ГВт. Вместе эти предприятия создадут «многофункциональную экосистему чистой энергии гигаваттного масштаба», объединяющую под одной крышей оборудование для солнечной энергетики, накопления энергии и производства зеленого водорода. «Этот комплексный подход не только обеспечивает масштабируемость, но и создаёт конкурентное преимущество в плане стоимости, технологий и устойчивости цепочки поставок, позволяя Reliance получать значительную выгоду по мере ускорения глобального энергетического перехода», — сказал Амбани. «Reliance станет единственной в мире полностью интегрированной, самодостаточной компанией в области новой энергетики», — добавил он. Амбани сообщил, что работы над энергетическим комплексом Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga идут рекордными темпами. Он не будет иметь себе равных в мире по размерам, масштабу и уровню интеграции. Компания заявила, что солнечные панели, произведенные на ее заводе в Джамнагаре, поставляются в Кутч в штате Гуджарат, где она строит солнечную электростанцию, «одну из крупнейших в мире». Ранее компания говорила, что хочет построить «как минимум» 100 ГВт солнечной генерации в штате Гуджарат до 2030 года.

      "full_text": "В 2024 году индийская металлургическая компания Jindal Stainless Limited (JSL)начала использоватьзеленый водород в производстве нержавеющей стали в Хисаре, штат Харьяна. Компания вошла во вкус и намедни решила построить новую установку по производству зеленого водорода на другой площадке — в промышленном комплексе JSL Kalinga Nagar в Джаджпуре, Одиша. Для этого Jindal заключила соглашение с Greenzo Energy India Ltd на поставку, строительство и ввод в эксплуатацию соответствующего оборудования. Доставка запланирована в течение шести месяцев после подписания контракта. Первоначально завод будет производить 5 256 000 Нм³/год зеленого водорода (приблизительно 0,47 тысячи тонн) с последующим масштабированием до 1,5 тысячи тонн в год. Зеленый водород будет использоваться в критически важных процессах производства нержавеющей стали, что позволит Jindal Stainless выпускать зеленую сталь и значительно сократить свой углеродный след. Ранее Jindal Stainless, крупнейший производитель нержавеющей стали в Индии, официальновзял на себя обязательствадостичь углеродной нейтральности (Net Zero) до 2050 года в соответствии с методологией Инициативы по научно обоснованным целям(SBTi). В дополнение к поставке технологий, Greenzo обеспечит комплексное обучение и оперативную поддержку, включая 30 дней обучения на месте для технической команды JSL и 11 месяцев виртуального руководства, обеспечивая бесперебойную интеграцию завода и долгосрочную операционную эффективность. Сандип Агарвал, управляющий директор Greenzo Energy India Ltd, заявил: «Наши электролизерные системы, разработанные в Индии, предназначены для обеспечения эффективности, надежности и масштабируемости. Полностью отечественный щелочной биполярный электролизер оснащен разработанной в Индии технологией биполярного стека, обеспечивает выход водорода при давлении 30 бар, сверхвысокую чистоту 99,99999% и поставляется с интегрированной автоматизацией на основе SCADA и искусственного интеллекта для оптимизации в режиме реального времени и прогнозной диагностики. Мы гордимся, что поддерживаем дорожную карту чистой энергии JSL и вносим значительный вклад в миссию Индии по зеленому водороду». В августе 2021 года премьер-министр Индии Нарендра Модиобъявил о запуске «Национальной водородной миссии»(National Green Hydrogen Mission) с целью сделать Индию «глобальным центром производства, использования и экспорта зеленого водорода и его производных». Миссия нацелена на производство 5 миллионов тонн зеленого водорода к 2030 году и связанное с этим развитие мощностей возобновляемой энергетики. В феврале 2022 года Индия опубликовалаполитикув области зеленого водорода / зеленого аммиака (Green Hydrogen/ Green Ammonia Policy). В феврале нынешнего года Министерство новых и возобновляемых источников энергии Индииопубликовало«Руководящие принципы реализации пилотных проектов по использованию зеленого водорода в сталелитейном секторе» в рамках «Национальной водородной миссии». В то время пока Европа сталкивается с большими трудностями при внедрении зеленого водорода в промышленности, Индия превращается в одного из мировых лидеров водородной экономики. Свидетельством тому, например, являются выдающиесярезультатыконкурсных отборов на поставки зеленого аммиака, проходящие в стране.

      "full_text": "Компания Sinovoltaics опубликовала отчет, в котором содержатся сведения о фабриках по производству солнечных панелей и ячеек, которые строятся или запланированы к строительству в Африке и на Ближнем Востоке. В настоящее время в регионе размещены производства солнечных панелей общей мощностью 3,4 ГВт, элементов (ячеек) мощностью 2,5 ГВт и кремниевых слитков (кристаллов) на 8,05 ГВт. По данным Sinovoltaics, к 2030 году мощности по производству фотоэлектрических модулей достигнут 62,12 ГВт, солнечных элементов 52,55 ГВт, поликремния – 45 ГВт. Кроме того, ожидается создание производств металлургического кремния мощностью 290 тысяч тонн. Особенно следует подчеркнуть вертикальную интеграцию – инвесторы ориентированы не только на сборку модулей в странах Ближнего Востока и Африки, но и на создание всей цепочки, начиная с производства поликремния. Это позволит закрыть местные потребности и также обеспечить экспорт на рынки, которые закрыты или закрываются от китайских изделий по политическим и/или протекционистским причинам, основной из которых – США. Кроме того, близость региона к Европе потенциально позволит заместить продукцию из Юго-Восточной Азии в европейском импорте. В отчете перечислены 27 производственных площадок, которые обозначены на приложенной карте. Разумеется, среди инвесторов много китайских компаний, в том числе такие гранды, как JinkoSolar и JA Solar. В июле 2024 года Саудовская Аравияпривлеклакитайских инвесторов для создания гигантских производств кремниевых пластин, солнечных модулей и ветряных турбин. Намедниотмечалось, что импорт солнечных панелей из Китая вырос в Африке на 60% за последние 12 месяцев (июль 2024-июнь 2025) и составил 15,03 ГВт. Это свидетельствует о быстром росте солнечной энергетике на континенте. В марте текущего годасообщалось, что японский производитель фотоэлектрических элементов и модулей Toyo Solar планирует увеличить свои мощности по выпуску солнечных элементов (ячеек) в Эфиопии до 4 ГВт. В 2024 году компания EliTe Solarобъявилаоб инвестициях в создание производственного комплекса по выпуску фотоэлектрических ячеек и модулей годовой мощностью 8 ГВт в Суэцкой китайско-египетской зоне экономического и торгового сотрудничества (TEDA Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone) в Египте. Первый этап строительства, который, как ожидается, будет завершен к сентябрю 2025 года, предполагает создание производства солнечных батарей мощностью 2 ГВт.

In August 2025, XPENG scored 37,709 deliveries, 169% more than in August 2024. Month over month, the growth was not nearly as dramatic. Basically, sales growth has leveled off. The 37,709 deliveries of August 2025 were just 3% higher than the July 2025 total — but they did reach a new monthly record for the company. Across the first 8 months of the year, XPENG completed 271,615 deliveries. That’s 252% more than in the first 8 months of 2024! Now, one might be concerned that XPENG’s sales growth is now plateauing and the company soon won’t be able to highlight massive year-over-year sales increases. As you can see in the charts above and below, XPENG’s vehicle sales spiked in about November 2024 due to significant production and sales progress. Perhaps it will be hard to sustain the rapid growth we’ve been seeing, but XPENG does have an answer on the table. That’s the all-new P7. Deliveries have already begun in the past few days. Last but not least, XPENG customers are apparently ready for the future and very into the company’s advanced driver-assist technology. “In August 2025, XNGP achieved an urban driving monthly active user penetration rate of 85%,” XPENG shares. “Since its introduction, the human-AI co-pilot feature has been well-received and widely embraced by users.” Indeed.

      "full_text": "Last Updated on:3rd September 2025, 12:14 am InPart One of this story, we detailed how the efforts of Americans for Prosperity seek to shove the pro-fossil fuel policies of Charles Koch down the throats of Vermont residents. That story was based on joint reporting byVtDiggerandGrist. While it was primarily about Vermont,Gristwent on to explore in detail the efforts Charles and David Koch have made to shape America according to their own philosophy, which glorifies fossil fuels. Americans for Prosperity was founded in 2004 byCharles Kochand his brother David, who died in 2019. Together they amassed great wealth through Koch Industries, an oil refinery and pipeline conglomerate that has gobbled up many other companies since their father, Fred Koch, created the business in the 1930s. Fred Koch had an idea for refining petroleum that was spurned by the US government and other oil companies, so he put it to use to provide fuels to the Russian and German military machines. The fact that millions died as a result was immaterial to Fred. He was a first-generation immigrant whose father moved to Texas from the Netherlands. He never forgave the US for spurning his ideas and became a co-founder of the John Birch Society in 1958. The group was part of what many thought of as the lunatic fringe, as it battled integration and the liberation of women. Presumably, his sons were treated to daily anti-government diatribes by their father during their formative years. Now, today, the nutso ravings of Fred Koch are the bedrock of the MAGA effort to overthrow the Constitution. For an excellent analysis of the rise ofKoch power, readers are encouraged to read the in-depth article “The Making Of The Koichtopus” in the November 3, 2014 edition ofMother Jones. Suffice it to say that the Kochs were founders of the Tea Party movement that clamored for lower taxes, less government regulation, and more power for the individual states. The war on deregulation is interesting, because while decrying federal regulations, the Kochs took advantage of one government regulation that encouraged refineries to accept the gunk coming from the Alberta tar sands. No one else in America could process the stuff except a small refinery in the Midwest. When even it found the business unprofitable, it put the refinery up for sale as a distressed asset and the Kochs swooped in and bought it. That refinery became the basis of their empire, which means their wealth is based on the dirtiest, filthiest, most polluting source of oil known. And absent federal government support, it never would have happened. As the Koch empire grew, Charles used his increasing political power to wrest concessions from Congress that altered the IRS code to allow special interest groups like Americans For Prosperity to operate in secret, thereby setting the stage for the dark money era. His fingerprints are all over the Federalist Society that counts six of the current members of the Supine Court among its distinguished alumni. USSC decisions like Citizens United are the result of Charles’ constant agitating in the shadows. The court will shortly overturn a federal appeals court decision that found most of the tariffs imposed by the current administration were imposed illegally. When it does, there will be no restraints on the horrors the administration has in store. Amplifying the power of the president is one of the most cherished goals of Charles Koch and his minions. The Koch fingerprints are also all over the hate-filled Project 2025, created by another Koch instrumentality — the Heritage Foundation. Project 2025 is the distillation of all the hatred Fred Koch harbored for the federal government and marks Charles Koch as the most powerful person in America that almost no one has ever heard of. Thanks toGrist, he is now getting the notoriety he so richly deserves. Every sordid detail about the Koch influence is documented in Jane Mayer’s exquisite exposéDark Money. Gristsays the Kochs have used their “wealth to remake the national GOP into the party of climate denial after government regulation of pollution and a push for renewables threatened their oil empire. In 2008, they began the ‘No Climate Tax Pledge,’ asking officials to vote against spending money to fight climate change without equivalent tax cuts. By 2013, 411 officials had signed, including a quarter of senators and a third of representatives, along with other leaders like US Attorney General Pam Bondi.” Greenpeace has called the Kochs the “financial kingpin of climate science denial and clean energy opposition,” partnering with and then outspending better known oil corporations like ExxonMobil. During the first Trump administration, they launched local campaigns through Americans for Prosperity toroll back vehicle emissions standards. The Koch-funded networks have heavily influenced both Trump terms. In the first term, about 50 administration officials had ties to Koch networks, including Energy Secretary Rick Perry and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. Today, key figures like Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have worked closely with and donated large sums to both Americans for Prosperity and other Koch-affiliated groups,Gristreports. The summer campaign in Vermont comes as the second Trump administration launches an unprecedented attack on the climate and clean energy policies that gained traction under the Biden administration. Along with deleting climate information and reports from federal websites, the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy have spent six months deregulating fossil fuels and slashing clean energy projects. Project 2025 calls for breaking up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the nation’s premier climate science agency, calling it “one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry.” Trump’s 2026 budget proposal eliminates the agency’s research arm, which is responsible for helping the country adapt to climate change. For Ross Connolly, the head of Americans For Prosperity in New England, his lurch to the right came during college, when he readRoad to Serfdomby Friedrich Hayek. According toWikipedia: “The Road to Serfdom is a book by the Austrian-British economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek. In the book, Hayek ‘[warns] of the danger of tyranny that inevitably results from government control of economic decision-making through central planning.’ “He further argues that the abandonment of individualism and classical liberalism inevitably leads to a loss of freedom, the creation of an oppressive society, the tyranny of a dictator, and the serfdom of the individual. Hayek challenged the view, popular among British Marxists, that fascism (including Nazism) was a capitalist reaction against socialism. He argued that fascism, Nazism, and state-socialism had common roots in central economic planning and empowering the state over the individual.” According to Mayer’sDark Money, that book has also had a powerful influence on Charles Koch. The irony is that the policies of Americans For Prosperity in particular, and Charles Koch in general, will result in precisely the consequences predicted by Hayek — making serfs of us all, especially people of color and women, who in the wonderful world of MAGA, will be relegated to the role of breeders with no dominion over their own bodies. Do you suppose Charles Koch understands that by unleashing the forces of evil he champions, he would be subject to deportation if the government decides to end birthright citizenship? Naah, frankly, he seems unable to think that deeply or appreciate how the words of his mentor have metastasized into a system that will make serfs of us all. How ironic that by pedaling furiously to avoid serfdom, he has led the country to precisely that result. After graduating from college, Connolly worked for Republican campaigns before joining Americans for Prosperity in 2013. AFP has since expanded to 37 state chapters, but the only chapter in the six New England states is in New Hampshire. Eventually, AFP could establish a chapter in Vermont, which would give it infrastructure and full-time staff, and enable a permanent presence in the state. “We promise we will be here for the long term,” Connolly told the audience at Rutland. “We at AFP are not going anywhere.” And we who value democracy and individual liberty will oppose you at every step of the way, Ross, in Vermont and every other state, with every fiber of our beings. You are making America into a new feudal society as you prostrate yourself before the alter of oil. The thirty pieces of silver you get for spreading your message of hate will never be enough to expiate your sins. The only Americans who will prosper in the Kochtocracy to come are those who are already wealthy. Selling the dream of prosperity to the rest of us is a cruel joke, and it is quite amazing how many do not realize how, in the final analysis, the joke is on them.

The Balkan Peninsula is a mother lode of renewable energy potential, including hydropower, biomass, geothermal, and solar as well as wind energy, and that includes Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).

Earlier this yearthe BiH Independent System Operatorran the numbers and came up with a total of 3.8 gigawatts in new wind farms under development through 2035, along with 12.5 gigawatts of solar. Into this mix jumps POWERCHINA, the Power Construction Corporation ofChina. On September 1, China’s state-run news organization CRI drew attention to the company’s 20-turbine, 84-megawatt Ivovik wind energy venture in BiH, which commenced trial operations in January.The new wind farmcomplements the firm’s new Ulog hydropower project, also located in BiH. The two projects “represent a significant step for Chinese-built power equipment inEastern Europe,” CRI noted in a press release, adding that the ventures “also reflect a broader effort to align Chinese and European technical standardsin support of global climate goals.” A generating capacity of 84 megawatts is fairly modest by today’s standards, but the Ivovik project will claim the title of the largest renewable energy project in BiH to date, with an annual output of 259 million kilowatt-hours. “According to project figures, that output could displace roughly 240,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions per year,” CRI stated. CRI also used the occasion to point out that the new wind farm will have an outsized impact on China’s footprint in the global wind energy industry, in Europe and beyond. “The Ivovik project is notable as the first foreign-concession energy venture in BiH and the country’s first renewable development led by a Chinese firm,” CRI emphasized. For the record, the Ulog hydropower project is the also first of its kind to be developed by a Chinese firm in BiH. “For POWERCHINA, the developments highlight the company’s growing role in Europe’s clean-energy buildout,” CRI noted. “Company officials describe the Ivovik and Ulog projects as ‘a bridge’ between China and BiH—both in strengthening renewable infrastructure and in signaling broader cooperation on climate and energy transition.” In contrast, news organizations here in the US don’t much in the way to report about broader cooperation on climate action and the energy transition between the US and BiH or, for that matter, between the US and any other country. Instead, they are left trying to make sense of an “American Energy Dominance” policy that throttles down the nation’s two most abundant and accessible energy resources — the sun and the wind — in favor of fossil fuels along with a generoushodgepodge of other renewablesincluding geothermal, hydropower, and biomass, withmarine energyalso making the cut. Anyone trying to rationalize this heady brew might as well pack up, go home, and while away the hours picking lint out of their bellybutton. That would be a more productive use of time than attempting to describe why the Commander-in-Chief is waging war against wind energy as well as solar, while other renewables enjoy the protective embrace of American Energy Dominance. The obvious answer, of course, is that the war on wind energy is a simple matter of personal spite, writ large with all the wealth and power a self-dealing grifter can muster, with solar energy thrown in as collateral damage. Conveniently, wind and solar are the only two domestic energy resources that fail to reach the Trump administration’santiquated “reliability” bar. The well-documented roots of Trump’s obsession with wind energy go back to the years leading up to his first successful bid for the White House. In 2012 hisnew golf course at Aberdeen in Scotlandopened for business, and the next year he sued to stop 11 offshore wind turbines from being installed within sight of the new venture. “He was furious when the Scottish government approved plans for the renewable energy development within sight of his multi-million pound golf development on the Menie estate, north of Aberdeen,” notedBBC, among many other news organizations tracking the battle. “He saidthe turbines would spoil the view,”BBCadded. Oh the irony, it burns. Golf courses themselves represent view spoilage on a massive scale, reducing the natural ramble of existing landscapes to stiffened swaths of cropped grass, where order is maintained with chemical treatments and greenhouse gas-spewing grounds equipment. In terms of the spoilage of views, the Menie golf project was particularly egregious because the construction workdamaged protected dunesthat Trump had promised to preserve. In 2020, Scottish environmental authorities determined that the damage was severe and irreversible, thereby removing the dunes from protection altogether. Trump or no Trump, the global wind industry, of course, is not going anywhere. The technology is not going away, either. Wind energy, onshore and off, will continue to feature in the power generation plans of nations around the world. After all, the wind isn’t going to stop blowing. Meanwhile, offshore wind energy stakeholders here in the US tried to catch Trump’s attention on the heels of Election Day last year, including the trade organization Oceantic Network. On November 6, Oceantic president Liz Burdock emphasized that the industry sprawls far beyond the turbines themselves to embracea 39-state supply chainthat employs thousands of workers in manufacturing, ship-building, and upgrades to seaport infrastructure, among other elements. Bellybutton, meet lint. Despite the clear potential for killing off thousands of jobs in red and blue state alike, Trump followed through with his vendetta against wind energy upon taking office, the offshore industry being a particularly ripe target because it depends on leases issued by the Interior Department.The offshore lease programwas the first to fall under the axe, and the rug has also been been ripped out from underpartly-finished wind projectsby order of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. Adding insult to injury, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy chipped in his two cents last week, clawing back$679 million in federal fundingfor 12 different seaport upgrade projects. The upgrades would have benefited other industries in addition to the offshore wind industry. Clinging to one last shred of hope, later this week 18 Democratic attorneys general will appearin federal courtto argue that the Trump administration has no authority to review, let alone stop, offshore wind energy projects that are already in the pipeline.

      "full_text": "Vermont, with its rolling hills, hidden valleys, and rushing mountain streams, is of the most beautiful states in the nation. During a recent visit, I saw a Subaru with a bumper sticker that said, “Practice Civility.” Vermonters tend to be practical folks, with a strong understanding of what’s right, and good, and decent about America. It was the first state to pass a“polluters pay” lawmodeled after the federal Superfund law that seeks to force those who damage the environment to bear the cost of cleaning up their mess.Green Mountain Poweris actively promoting virtual power plant technology and the state is supportive ofcommunity solar. Vermonters do not shout about their politics from the highest mountain top and are tolerant of those who have different views.. It has a Democratic legislature, a Republican governor, and a Senator who is fiercely independent. The people who live there are not “woke,” but tolerant of those who march to the beat of a different drummer. Naturally, the Heritage Foundation, the Koch supported organization that gave us Project 2025, cannot stand to see a state that is so respectful of others. Therefore, it has sent its operatives, working under the guise of Americans For Prosperity, into Vermont to teach Vermonters how to hate others, strip people of their access to affordable health care, force women to dedicate their reproductive organs to the glorification of the state, and destroy science and education in all forms. A joint investigative report byVtDiggerandGristreveals that Americans for Prosperity, a radical right wing organization whose members are known to foam at the mouth over climate science, is now testing its playbook in Vermont. That campaign is being led by Ross Connolly, the group’s 34-year-old northeast regional director, who calls Vermont “bizarro-New Hampshire.” A political opportunist from New Hampshire, he says,”I could talk endlessly about all the good things New Hampshire’s doing and all the bad things that Vermont has done.” In July, he wrote that “the state’s progressive majority has chosen to inflate taxes and increase regulations” and “advance their own radical agenda.” “So many groups on the right, center-right, don’t get involved in the northeast outside of New Hampshire or Pennsylvania,” Connolly said in an interview this month. “If we don’t fight for people in those areas, we’re never going to make any sort of difference.” Americans for Prosperity claims its mission is helping Vermonters afford to live in the state. But it was founded by two brothers who made their fortune in the oil business and who devoted their lives to attacking climate science. Wealthy people typical have a low regard for ordinary folks trying to make ends meet every day. Things are not going particularly well for AFP in the Green Mountain State. A rally in Rutland this summer drew just 15 people, half of them politicians hoping to attract attention to their campaigns. In addition to Connolly, AFP has two other operatives in Vermont — Rachel Burgin, who lives in Georgia, and Lauren Schley, whose LinkedIn page says she works for Americans for Prosperity out of Washington, D.C. Vermont residents who are actively working to spread the gospel according to AFP? Zero, so far as anyone can tell. One thing that sticks in the craw of Americans For Prosperity is a Vermont initiative to promote heat pumps for residences and business. That program has beenhighly successful in Maine, where propane and oil companies engaged in a campaign of distortions and half truths in an attempt to kill the initiative. They failed, and today the demand for heat pumps in Maine is growing every year. If AFP was truly interested in helping Vermonters afford to heat their homes in the winter, they would back the heat pump initiative simply because those devices are two to three times more efficient than propane and oil furnaces. In essence, they give more heat per dollar than propane or oil heat, which means they lower the cost of staying warm dramatically. But that cuts into the profits of propane and oil companies. By its actions, AFP shows it doesn’t care a flying fig about people; it only cares about preserving fossil fuel company profits. State Senator Anne Watson says groups like Americans for Prosperity opposed the energy transition because it undercut the profits of its oil tycoon founders. “Vermonters need to be savvy about that, and recognize when outside influence is coming in to try and affect our policies and our elections.” “Vermont was considering this first-of-its-kind clean heat standard that would hold fossil fuel companies to a standard of actually reducing carbon emissions in a way that the electric utility sector has had to do for decades,” said Elena Mihaly, vice president for the Vermont chapter of the Conservation Law Foundation, a clean energy advocacy group based in New England. “They were trying to nip it in the bud here in Vermont before it got out.” Watson added, “We know Vermonters care about climate change, and they care about affordability. Both of those things are met by advancing renewables and renewable energy sources in the state because the vast majority are cheaper than their fossil fuel counterparts.” Americans For Prosperity should really be called Oil Billionaires In Search Of Bigger Profits. It is against federal subsidies for energy programs that could lower energy costs for low income Vermonters. The Green Mountain State was in line to receive $62.5 million under theSolar For Allprogram, but that money was eliminated by the One Big Beautiful Bill earlier this year that took a sledgehammer to federal clean energy initiatives. “We believe those subsidies should have ended,” Connolly said of Solar for All, but conveniently forgot to add that the massive federal subsidies that coal, oil, and methane companies get. Hypocrisy is rampant on the far right, which welcomes subsidies that favor its supporters but scream bloody murder when someone else — especially poor people — receive any benefit from the government. How these people can face themselves in the mirror every morning is an enduring mystery. When OBBB passed, AFP held a One Big Beautiful Bash to celebrate the fact that low income American families would now be forced to buy more expensive oil and propane to heat their homes. That should tell you all you need to know about these grifters. Instead of renewables, Connolly said the region needed more small nuclear reactors, as well as the expansion of natural gas pipelines. He forgot to mention that small nuclear reactor technology does not currently exist at commercial scale and may never do so. Predictably, AFP is also opposed to the Vermont Climate Superfund Act, which charges oil companies for greenhouse gas emissions between 1995 and 2024. The law applies a “polluter pays” mindset to climate recovery, potentially giving Vermont resources to build back from disasters like recent devastating floods. “If your concern is climate change, that does absolutely nothing to solve climate change,” Connolly said. “It’s sort of petty type politics where it’s like, we’re going after Big Oil and punishing them. Vermont isn’t going to bankrupt ExxonMobil or any of these companies. You’re just going to drive them out of your state and drive energy costs higher because of it.”Translation: We should be free to spread our filthy emissions throughout the environment and force others to clean up our mess. Charles Koch loves to wrap his warped ideas in the flag. The words “American” and “Heritage” figure prominently in the names of several pressure groups he has founded and supports financially. His Heritage Foundation created the hate-filled Project 2025 that the current failed administration is using as a playbook to undo much of the progress made by women and people of color over the past 50 years. The people of Vermont are free to decide how they want to address the gathering storm of climate change any way they want, but they should be fully informed about the motivations of those who want to influence their thinking. While in Vermont last week, I had a chance to meet with Jock Gill, a college classmate who lives in Peacham. Jock was directly involved in the installation of a community solar system in his town and he has some thoughts about AFP and its campaign. When it comes to the constant complaints by fossil fuel companies about subsidies for renewable energy, he counters that the oil depletion allowance, added to the tax code in 1926, “dwarfs any green energy support. Either we should support green energy at the same level or we should cancel the depletion allowance altogether. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander. Symmetry is key to fairness and justice.” He went on to say, “A key question is why do the conservative groups want to impose the most expensive energy with the least energy security and weak energy resilience on anyone, much less Vermonters? It has to be made clear that this is not about green energy, but rather about lowest cost energy with the best energy security and resilience that happens to be green and forward looking.” Lastly, Gill observed that conservatives are “at best transactional tactical thinkers. They are unable, or unwilling, to imagine how energy, education and broadband could work together to create something much greater than the sum of the parts. How do they want to get to the future? What sort of future do they want? Their go-slow approach only results in ever worse climate changes and consequences. What is their strategy for minimizing the risks of climate degradation? Or will they delay until there is no time left for effective action?” Those are excellent questions, and they are precisely the ones Vermonters should be asking Ross Connolly the next time he deigns to come to the Green Mountain State to advocate for the policies promoted by his paymasters.

      "full_text": "Industry experts note that the collaboration reinforces Kenya’s position as a hub for sustainable innovation, demonstrating how cross-sector partnerships can accelerate climate resilience and create new economic opportunities. The lack of access to clean cooking and sustainable transport is a big issue on the African continent. In an exciting development, two companies working to solve both these problems have just signed a partnership agreement. This development highlights the growing clean tech ecosystem on the African continent that is now ramping up, and in the process unlocking valuable inherent synergies. Kenya’s clean energy sector has received a major boost following a new partnership between electric mobility leader Spiro and clean fuel distributor KOKO Networks. The partnership will see more than 3,000 KOKO delivery agents adopt Spiro’s electric motorbikes, marking a major milestone in the clean energy and transport sectors. By tapping into Spiro’s e-mobility platform, KOKO will extend its sustainability strategy beyond kitchens into transport, reducing distribution costs while contributing to Kenya’s decarbonization agenda. KOKO Networks distributes bio-ethanol cooking fuel to households in Kenya and Rwanda. Spiro operates more than 35,000 electric motorbikes across Africa and runs the continent’s largest battery-swapping network, with over 20 million battery swaps completed. Spiro says the company’s expanding network of more than 800 swap stations ensures riders and enterprises can access reliable, zero-emission transport at scale. It’s 2025, and sadly, over 900 million people still do not have access to clean cooking. Yes, almost 1 billion people on the African continent lack access to clean cooking. Wood fuel, waste, and charcoal burned in three‐stone fires are still the dominant energy sources for cooking on the continent. The fuel is “free,” relatively easy to find, and the three‐stone fire offers not only a cooking platform but also provides heat in the colder months of the year. However, the smoke associated with cooking from open fires is dangerous. 4 million people die every year from illnesses associated with smoke from cooking. The Clean Cooking Alliance notes that women and children in developing countries are severely affected as they spend up to 20 hours a week gathering these wood fuels or similar for cooking. Accelerating the transmission to cleaner cooking has become critical and will allow women and children to free up time to take up more productive activities in the community. A lot of these people are in Africa and KOKO Networks is working to help address this major problem. KOKO says it is mainstreaming liquid bioethanol cooking fuel as a fast, safe, and affordable alternative to dirty cooking fuels such as charcoal. Their website says,“We partner with the downstream fuels industry to “drop in” this new fuel, and offer a suite of distribution, dispensing and end-use technologies that ensure customers can safely access clean fuel at prices that undercut dirty fuels. The solution to African deforestation starts in its cities, by switching households away from charcoal cooking fuel.” KOKO says it harnesses bioethanol, a renewable liquid fuel that is already produced at scale as a byproduct of sugar production in most tropical nations. KOKO adds that its ecosystem enables large fuel companies to easily source and handle bioethanol using facilities they already have for petrol, diesel, and kerosene, and then distribute the clean fuel to a network of KOKO bioethanol fuel dispensers (fuel ATMs). These smart fuel ATMs are placed inside thousands of small neighborhood shops by KOKO, enabling widespread fuel availability. KOKO’s distribution channel will now take advantage of the growing electric motorcycle taxi and delivery sector to unlock efficiencies in this network. Motorcycle taxis are a phenomenon on the African continent, which explains why the motorcycle taxi industry is attracting huge attention and investments. These motorcycle taxis are the heartbeat of the passenger and small goods transport system in a lot of countries in Africa. Close to 30 million motorcycles on the continent are used in this motorcycle taxi industry. With almost 99% of them still being internal combustion engine motorcycles, there is a huge opportunity and a large addressable market for electrification. The move towards electric vehicles in Africa, especially in this electric motorcycle sector, has mainly been driven by the private sector by small startup companies. A number of these motorcycle startups are now scaling at an incredible pace. Spiro is leading this charge with the highest number of motorcycles on the road, as well as battery swap and charging stations. Spiro and KOKO’s growth in their respective sectors have resulted in the development of inherent synergies leading to their paths to meet sooner rather than later. Another positive to add in there is that Kenya’s electricity generation mix is quite clean, with over 90% of electricity generated coming from renewables. That means as KOKO works to lower smoke due to cooking with open fires, and Spiro is working to lower tailpipe emissions in the motorcycle sector, the synergies between the two will have a compounding effect on emissions savings as the two firms continue to scale and unlock further synergies. By gradually increasing the penetration of electric motorcycles in Kenya, significant savings in CO2 emissions can be achieved through displacing petrol imports with locally generated renewables. This can be achieved by incentivizing purchases of new electric motorbikes. 2023 was the first time the Kenyan motorcycle sales market saw a noticeable increase in the share of electric motorcycles in the overall new registrations market. In 2023, there were 70,691 motorcycles sold in Kenya. 2,557 of these were electric. That means 3.6% of motorcycles sold in 2023 in Kenya were electric. That is almost 4%. So, we did not expect it to be long before the market share reached the critical 5%, which is generally viewed as the tipping point indicating the start of mass adoption. The share of electric motorcycles rose to 3.6% in 2023 from 2.8% in 2022 and 0.5% in 2021. 2024 was even better as the market share surged to 7.1%. The KNBS Economic Survey Report (2025) shows that 68,804 new motorcycles were registered in Kenya in 2024. Of these, 4,862 motorcycles were electric, according to data presented by the Electric Mobility Association of Kenya (EMAK). That is where the 7.1% market share comes from. B2B fleet sales and partnerships such as this one between Spiro and KOKO will help accelerate the transition to electric.

      "full_text": "After a series of other articles about the US electric vehicle (EV) market in the second quarter, here’s our last analysis and statistical breakdown for the quarter. This one concerns what percentage of different brands’ and auto groups’ total auto sales were EV sales last quarter. (Note that we’re only referring to 100% battery-electric vehicles here, not plugin hybrids.) Starting with brands, naturally, we do have six auto brands that are fully electric brands. I do like leaving these in here because: 1) it shows the final target and how far away from it different brands are, and 2) as more brands are formed or climb into this position, it’s fun seeing those bars grow in number. Looking past them, though, we see Fiat at a very high level (86.3), but Fiat is tiny. Next up is the first really notable result. Cadillac is leading the way with 26.6% of its sales coming from EVs! Not too shabby. How long until it gets to 30%? 50%? Acura is far below that, but it’s not doing to shabby at 14.7%, and Audi and Porsche are right behind it at 14.4% and 14.3%, respectively. But they are so far behind Cadillac now. Can they catch up? Wrapping up the brands with more than 10% of their sales coming from EVs, we’ve got BMW at 12.2%. Though, Volvo and Dodge are not far behind 10% at 9.2% and 9.1%, respectively.Dodge?!?!Wow, how did that happen?! As far as auto groups go, there’s nothing quite as spectacular, but BMW Group is now at 11.3% of its sales coming from EVs, and fellow German Volkswagen Group is in second place at 8.5%. Overall, though, the percentages are quite disappointing, and even third place GM is at only 6.0%. Disappointing? Yes. But this is the United States after all. How long will it take until we have three of these auto groups above 10% EV share, or at 50% EV share for that matter? Any guesses? Zach is tryin' to help society help itself one word at a time.

      "full_text": "Almost one hundred and forty-three years ago, on September 5, 1882, workers in New York City celebrated the first Labor Day holiday with a parade. The occasion becamean annual celebrationof the social and economic achievements of US workers and their contributions to the country’s strength, prosperity, and well-being. Workers marched this Labor Day, September 1, 2025, in opposition to the Trump administration’spoliciesthat have forced federal employees from their jobs, attempted to weaken collective bargaining, cut the minimum wage, eviscerated Medicaid, and removed legal immigrant workers. Nearly 1,000 “Worker over Billionaire” protests were held in all 50 states as part of a Labor Day week of action organized by labor unions and advocacy groups. The Enfield, Connecticut group numbered just about 100 persons but seemed to spur a robust response from motorists, large numbers of whom waved and honked as they drove by. These protests complemented a nationalpollconducted by theAFL-CIOand David Binder Research, which found trust in labor unions is at 55% – larger than the 36% of respondents who said they trusted the Democratic party and the 35% of respondents who said they trusted the Republican party. Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO,argued, “People are waking up to the fact we don’t have to just sit back and take it, and the labor movement is the place to go to channel that activism, to build what’s next, and we’re putting forward a vision for what the economy can be.” As of December 2024, private companies had announced more than$450 billionin new clean energy investments in almost every state in the US since President Joe Biden had taken office. These new investments helped create more than 400,000 good-paying clean energy jobs during Biden’s term. In contrast, Trump celebrated Labor Day this year by praising US workers but also enacting astop-work orderthat halted construction of a nearly-finished offshore wind farm, sidelining roughly 1,000 workers. The Administration has cancelled $679 million in funding for offshore wind projects. The Revolution Wind farm off the coast of Connecticut and Rhode Island was80% constructedand set to be completed in early 2026. Once online it could power more than 350,000 homes and enable Rhode Island to meet its goal of 100% renewable energy by 2033. Cancellation of this funding places Connecticut and Rhode Island jobs in jeopardy. Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO,saidhis members were caught off-guard by the administration’s move against the Revolution Wind project. “A lot of them voted for Trump, and they didn’t vote to have their jobs cut,” Crowley said. “That’s the level of anger right now.” The Board of Directors of the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticutexplainedthat the offshore Wind project is part of a $20 billion investment in “American energy generation, port infrastructure, supply chain, and domestic shipbuilding and manufacturing across over 40 states” by Ørsted, a Danish multinational company. “This move jeopardizes a critical source of clean, reliable energy for our region, along with the vital jobs, infrastructure investments, and energy cost savings it supports.” As if the halt to the Revolution Wind project wasn’t enough, the Department of Energy also announced it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee to complete infrastructure for an offshore wind project in New Jersey. Historian and social commentator Heather Cox Richardsonstatedthat the cancellations reflect Trump’s “apparent determination to kill off wind and solar power initiatives and to force the United States to depend on fossil fuels,” unlike former president Joe Biden, who made “investing in clean energy a central pillar of his administration.” Lou Antonellis, the business manager of the Massachusetts International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 103,addedthat the cuts to renewable energy projects in the US were not just cuts to projects. “You’re pulling paychecks from working families, you’re pulling apprentices out of training facilities, you’re pulling opportunity straight out of our communities. Every solar panel installed, every wind turbine wired, every EV charger connected, that’s a job with wages, healthcare, and a pension that stands for dignity for the American worker. You don’t kill that kind of progress: you build on it.” In 2023, clean energy investmentspoweredstrong overall growth ofjobs in the energy sector. Unionization rates in clean energy grew to their highest level yet, driven by large increases in union-dense construction and utility employment. Energy employers reported less difficulty in hiring qualified workers than in the previous year. US energy sector jobs grew 3% in 2023, outpacing solid overall US employment growth by 50%. Energy sector employment increased by over 250,000 from 8.10 million total energy jobs in 2022 to 8.35 million in 2023. The Trump policies to prop up the fossil fuel industry fail to take into account the strength and promise of the renewable energy sector. Meanwhile, as Trump pushesmisinformationabout renewables, electricity prices are steadily rising upward. Across the country, electricity priceshave jumpedmore than twice as fast as the overall cost of living in the last year. July’s fossil generation peak was the highest monthly total in nine years and yielded the largest US monthly power sector emissions toll since August 2021. The country’s largest grid, which stretches from Virginia to Illinois,dependson electricity that is derived from natural gas, coal, and nuclear reactors. The Energy Department says the cost of gas used to generate power jumped more than40%in the first half of this year compared to 2024. Another 17% increase is expected next year. Bappa SinhawritesinPeople’s Democracythat each energy administration carries “with it the underpinnings of an entire social order. Energy determines the productive forces, which in turn shape the relations of society. The type of power harnessed plays a significant role in shaping society.” Take the sun and wind. They’re free and abundant and free. After their infrastructure is in place, the ongoing cost of production plunges. “Where fossil fuels breed monopolies and imperial rivalries,” Sinha notes, “renewables open the possibility of decentralization, abundance, and long term planning.” It’s easy to forget how the electricity grid arose from the fossil and nuclear age. Its extensive networks moved electricity from enormouscentralized generation facilitieslocated away from end-users and connected to a network of high-voltage transmission lines. It allowed the US to become an electrified economy. But no longer can fossil fuels and nuclear meet the needs of humans —gridsmust be altered so that vast arrays of solar panels, wind farms, and batteries can proliferate across the world.

      "full_text": "Recently I sat down virtually with Laurent Segalen and Gerard Reid, investors, bon vivants, and hosts ofRedefining Energy, the main channel to my nerdcast side channelRedefining Energy—Tech. The reason? A fun episode of their podcast where we talked about sin, energy, and investment. Laurent Segalen [LS]:Today on Redefining Energy. This is a super special show for the end of the summer. Gerard. What are we going to talk about? Gerard Reid [GR]:We’re going to talk about the seven deadly sins of the energy world. [LS]: And in order to do so, we need to bring our blue flame thinker, our friend, colleague from Canada, Michael Barnard. Michael Barnard [MB]:Welcome, welcome. I’m so glad to be here, as always. [LS]:I don’t know who coined the term “seven sins.” It was Pope Gregory or someone in the sixth century. We decided—I don’t know exactly who, because we were exchanging ideas during the summer and it just popped up—to call it the seven sins of the energy transition. [GR]:It must have been me, because I’m the creative one. Just so you know, it must have been me. [LS]:That’s for sure. It was not me. [MB]:I certainly remember it being Gerard who was pushing for it. [GR]:It was somebody else that came up with the idea, but it was very good. [LS]:The seven sins are, Michael? [MB]:I’d just like to say that assertions I have personal and extensive experience with all of them are completely true. The list is greed, gluttony, sloth, pride, lust, wrath, anger, and envy. [LS]:Okay, I know you were educated in the seminar, but how does it translate for investment? [MB]:For investment, what we have to think about is that sins are the things we’re really subject to, which aren’t good for us or for others around us. In the energy world, as we consider the exemplars of sloth or greed, we have to say that if the analogy fits, then it’s going to hobble your investments. [LS]:So what are they, please? Number one, number two. Number three. [MB]:As we go through these: for greed, we have carbon capture and sequestration and direct air capture. Avarice and pipelines. For gluttony, nothing fits better than hydrogen—the calorie-bomb energy carrier. For sloth, it’s nuclear and small modular reactors. Then there’s pride: fusion, hubris with a torus. It’s very interesting research, but it has nothing to do with the energy transition or decarbonization. For lust, biofuels everywhere—the drop-in siren song. It’s a nice idea that we don’t have to replace the engines or the vehicles, but while we need biofuels for the really hard-to-decarbonize segments, we’re just going to electrify everything else. Then there’s wrath. This one leans into the United States right now, canceling offshore wind. It’s a reprise of rage against the turbines. And finally envy: the greenwashing cosplay of the past five years of ESG reporting. As somebody said, “I’ve got a guy in the sub-basement who fills in those forms for us.” [GR]:Well, why don’t we start with greed, which I’d describe as subsidy mining in a lab coat. You might call it carbon capture and direct air capture, but for me, it’s subsidy mining. [LS]:No, no, it’s regulatory capture, not carbon. Because they capture more subsidies than CO2. [MB]:I have to say, the entire Climeworks scandal—where they can’t actually get it to work and the expected targets are such a tiny amount—shows that they’re going to be capturing and sequestering less CO₂ than it costs to capture and sequester it. In terms of emissions, it’s just a dead end. While 420 parts per million is really problematic from a global warming perspective, it’s also an engineering problem. It’s like trying to strain a drop of urine out of an Olympic-sized swimming pool. You just have to accept that’s going to be hard. [GR]:Michael, what I’ll add to this—and I’d like to hear your thoughts on it—is that here we are during this podcast, and Germany is bringing in carbon capture regulations. [MB]:We will need some carbon capture. It will pencil out in some places—for example, where there’s an industrial source of fairly pure CO₂ at reasonable pressures that can be put into a sequestration site directly underneath. That’s probably going to be a cheap way to do it. If we think of electrified cement, or the Sublime process—the electrochemical process that produces a fairly pure stream of CO₂—located beside the ocean with a pipeline leading to offshore sequestration, that actually pencils out as fairly low-cost, low-carbon cement. But unless you have a sequestration site directly under the facility, or you’re on the seashore with a pipeline offshore, it just gets more and more expensive and less likely. [LS]:At the end of the day, it’s just cost—except when you do enhanced soil recovery, which has been going pretty well. Oxy is the big specialist in that. But otherwise, it’s basically asking the taxpayer to capture the carbon, and that’s pretty much it. [GR]: Well, I love that. But on that note, it brings us to the next one: gluttony. I just love it—three kilowatt hours to make one kilowatt hour. And I know you two guys love this topic. [LS]:It’s hydrogen. There’s a lot of technical conversation around it, and I’m not a technical guy—I’m a trader. What I do know, and I’ve checked on ChatGPT and elsewhere, is that $1 per kilo of hydrogen equals about $50 per barrel of oil in terms of energy content. You can say, no, it’s 48.9, but I round it to 50 because it’s easier. So you’ve got these guys saying, “Oh, that’s great, we’ve got hydrogen at $8 per kilo.” I say, okay, fine—$8 per kilo means you’re trying to sell a barrel of oil at $400 per barrel. The market price is 60. Just tell me who’s going to pay the $340 difference? It’s just too expensive, period. It is, once again, regulatory capture. [MB]:The nice thing about hydrogen is that while many people invested in its narrative, it was based on the false assumption that green hydrogen would be cheap. If hydrogen could be delivered at a dollar per kilogram, that would work. But in the 2010s, people asked, “How cheap does hydrogen have to be in order to be used?” and then invented a bunch of ways to make it seem like it could get there. They were invested in the idea of $1 per kilogram hydrogen. Instead of saying, “Well, we can’t get there, it’s never going to get there,” they kept pushing it. I did the math and figured it out back then. If they had done the same, they wouldn’t have spent the last five or ten years trying to make hydrogen into something it’s not—an energy carrier. [LS]:I’ve got some funny numbers. In Australia, two years ago they booked 5 gigawatts for electrolyzers—out of which they’ll get zero. Now those 5 gigawatts have been shifted to AI and data centers. They had projects in Australia, Gladstone, Fortescue. In Germany, ArcelorMittal canceled, E.ON canceled. In the US, BP and Exxon canceled their projects. Air Products canceled, and the CEO had to be fired. ThyssenKrupp, Nucera—projects abandoned. Repsol too. It goes on and on. Whatever money you throw at it, people just won’t do it. So for me, it’s dead. [MB]:We can see this with the major industrial players that were supposed to drive demand. Stellantis walked away from its hydrogen Sprinter vans and is now saying battery electric for the entire range. Airbus walked away from its hydrogen aviation efforts. What we’re seeing is that everyone trying to make hydrogen work as an energy carrier on the demand side is discovering it doesn’t. There are probably as many hydrogen bus fleets sitting idle as there are in use. Another case in point: Lower Saxony’s passenger train organization famously ignored the neighboring province’s assessment that hydrogen trains would cost three times as much as battery-plus-overhead hybrid systems. They bought 14 hydrogen trains from Alstom—only four are in operation now. Alstom can’t get new fuel cells from Cummins, which took over the hydrogen fuel cell manufacturer. [GR]:Great, guys. I want to talk about sloth, and it’s one of my favorite topics because it’s always on time and always on budget—and that, of course, is nuclear. So where do we start? I want to start with 2029. The first SMR is meant to be online. What do you think—will it actually be on in 2029? Or will it be 2039, or 2049? And will it be on budget or not? [MB]:Well, pick the project you’re referring to. Which one—the one in Ontario? [MB]:Yeah, the one in Ontario. SMRs are interesting. The premise of small modular reactors was that the problem with nuclear was big reactors—that’s why they went over budget. Instead, the idea was to build small modular reactors in factory-like settings and churn them out like Cracker Jack boxes. But it’s been funny to watch. SMRs were originally posited to be 20 to 70 megawatts in capacity. All of those have fallen by the wayside. Now a “small” modular reactor is 300 megawatts. And 300 megawatts isn’t particularly small. It’s a third the size of a typical gigawatt-scale reactor. At 300 megawatts, it’s still a multibillion-dollar construction project. It’s not something you manufacture and deliver. A big part of the SMR theory was Wright’s law: every time you double production of a manufactured object, costs go down. For more complex objects like fuel cells, it might be 10%; for solar panels and batteries, it’s about 20%. But with a 300-megawatt nuclear reactor, you’re just not going to build that many. It’s more of a custom engineering project, so you don’t get the economies of scale or the experience curve. Without the doublings, it loses out time and time again. [GR]:Still didn’t answer the question though. 2029—will they do it? It’s a Canadian project. Are you going to back your fellow countrymen? [MB]:It’s true. I’ve been to that site—Bruce Nuclear—and I will say it’s a wonderful jobs program for the 12,000 people there. But it’s not going to benefit Ontario’s electrical generation. If it’s up and running by 2035, I’ll be surprised. They haven’t started construction. [GR]:I love it. I love it. Laurent, give me a number. Give me a year. [LS]:They will put it out. I really wonder about the cost, because the all-in cost of new nuclear is already $200 per megawatt-hour, and those guys might be even more expensive—$300, $400. If somebody’s willing to pay five times the market price, that’s fine. What fascinates me is not Hitachi or Rolls-Royce—and by the way, those are mostly submarine designs that have been reshuffled—it’s all the startups: NuScale, Kairos, X-energy, Terrestrial, LeadCold, Oklo, Ultra Safe Nuclear. And then I see Breakthrough, OpenAI, Amazon throwing a lot of money at them. That’s fascinating. [MB]:The US venture capital industry has become a great way for people to get rich without delivering anything. If you can get funding, the Wall Street guys make money, the venture capitalists make money—maybe. It doesn’t seem to matter much. If you can get a big VC like Breakthrough to put $500 million into your fund, you can coast for years without delivering anything. [GR]:That leads us to pride. And the way I would describe pride is: we will bottle the sun, we will go back to the source of all energy. What’s that? [MB]:I agree with that premise. We are going to bottle the sun—we’re going to work off fusion energy—but we’re going to position it at a safe distance, about 93 million miles away. We’ll rely on its gravitational pull to keep us in the Goldilocks zone, where enough energy reaches us to warm us out of glaciation but not bake us like Mercury. We’re going to capture that fusion energy. I think that’s what we’ll do. But yes, we are going to depend on fusion energy. [LS]:If I look at the startups: Helion Energy, $500 million raise backed by Sam Altman; Commonwealth Fusion, $2 billion; General Fusion in Vancouver, $20 million; Tokamak Energy in Oxfordshire, $172 million; Zap Energy, $330 million; Renaissance Fusion; Microfusion; TAE Technologies, $1.2 billion. This is absolutely phenomenal. And then there’s the disgrace—the ITER project in France, which is what, 30 years late and 20 times over budget? [MB]:The budget is up to about $80 billion now. I looked into it a couple of years ago because its target for success—set for 2040—is to maintain fusion for five minutes with thermal net energy delivery. But thermal net energy delivery means that if you actually bolted a generation device onto it, the amount of energy required to run the process would be equivalent to the electricity you’d get back. So their target for sustained fusion is five minutes with no net electricity delivered. All these breakthroughs you hear about in fusion—when you look closely, nobody’s actually doing fusion yet. We’ve just reached the point where really hard, weird engineering problems are being exposed. We are so far from making it work. I always say there is a place for fusion energy—we’ll need it in spaceships past the orbit of Jupiter sometime in the next 200 years. I’m glad research departments are investigating it and that money is being spent, but it has nothing to do with the energy transition. [GR]:Well, that brings us to lust—and what we really want to talk about here are the drop-in fantasies for every engine: biofuels. So where do we start, guys? [LS]:All biofuels started about 25 years ago. First, you have two big ones: sugar-based ethanol, which is in Brazil and relatively cheap; and corn-based ethanol, which is an absolute disaster. Half of the corn acreage in the US goes into biofuels. Of course, this was designed at a time when the US was importing a lot of oil, peak oil fears were strong, and people thought oil would hit $300 a barrel. Big Agro was there, and corn-based ethanol became the “solution.” That created a constituency. Plus, as you know, the first round of the US election is in Iowa—and Iowa is big on biofuels. So the system fossilized itself. In Europe, I think at some point they said, okay, stop the blending. But even today it’s still designed for a barrel of oil at $150. Since oil is much cheaper, they have to force it into the system through blending mandates. [MB]:Michael, I’m actually a strong advocate of biofuels for SAF and maritime fuels—without going too deep into that subject. But I have to say, some of the first-generation biofuel stuff led to a lot of negative press that doesn’t hold up once we start looking at second- and third-generation biofuels. We’re now at a point where we can dual-crop. We can take the corn husks and stalks, feed them into biofuel processing, and get ethanol or methanol, while the corn itself goes into the food system. That turns agricultural waste into a valuable product. Similarly, we can put corn stalks through biodigesters and create biomethane for manufacturing methanol, long-duration energy storage, and other uses. I think the demonization of biofuels as agricultural food displacers doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. Europe is far too precious on the subject. It’s just calories—whether consumed by animals, humans, or motors. We need calories of some sort, and we need liquid fuels of some sort in the future. But imagining we’re going to run trains, trucks, or cars on them—that’s nonsense. All ground transportation will electrify directly with batteries. [GR]:So Michael, I certainly agree with you, and I’m not going to add anything to that—but I will. What I really want to talk about is wrath, and in particular the wrath of Mr. Trump. What’s he got to do with our space? It’s what we call the culture war at sea. [LS]:Offshore wind. We just had a series of bad news for Ørsted, the biggest European developer in the US. They took on 5 out of the 30 gigawatts of projects, and their cancellation in New Jersey cost them a lot. Now their Revolution project, which is 80% completed, has been stopped. They’re trying to raise money, but the dilution is going to be phenomenal. So I’m just going to say one thing: Equinørsted. [GR]:Very good, Laurent. Could happen, could happen. [MB]:I’m going to lean into something else—I’m going to blame golfers. A lot of the rage against wind turbines comes down to golfers being pissed off at missing a putt, or something about golfers. A lot of Trump’s anger about wind turbines comes from when he was building another golf course in Scotland. At the same time, far offshore, a wind farm was planned. Some golfers on the tee would see a turbine blade or two on the horizon. That turned into 14 years of Trump thinking wind turbines are the devil’s pitchforks and fighting them constantly. Trump doesn’t care if what he says is true. He cares if it lands like a wedge shot—communicating something for votes or gain at the moment. So when he attacks wind energy, he’s feeding the anti-wind ragtag band of zealots in the US, telling them what they want to hear. He’s also telling fossil fuel industry folks worried about displacement by renewables what they’d like to hear. Except the fossil fuel industry doesn’t want wind and solar to go away either. In many cases they’re invested in them. They need electricity to run their facilities, and they want cheap electricity—and wind and solar provide that. So Trump is irrational on the subject, but he’s feeding into the irrational in the United States. [GR]:There’s another view I’d like to talk about on offshore wind—the economics. If I look at the United States, I wonder: why do you even need it? North America already has so much low-cost electricity, whether from gas, wind, or solar. So why do it? That’s my thinking on that. And by the way, sorry if I sound like Trump as well, but offshore wind is the easiest fight to pick because all the players are foreign. So it’s a win for him in every way. [MB]:It’s not true though. GE Vernova has an offshore wind farm in operation. Second, you’re forgetting that the United States is finding it impossible to build transmission. They’ve got all that lovely wind in the prairies, but they can’t get it to the coastlines. It’s much easier to put a submarine HVDC cable from 30 kilometers offshore into New York than it is to run one from Iowa to New York. [GR]:And that’s a fair point. You could also say, well, let’s just put undersea cables along the East Coast and move electricity that way. But the US—you know as well as I do—it’s very difficult to get anything done because it’s all state-level policies. You’ve got state interests that aren’t aligned with neighboring states, and it’s just really complex. [MB]:After talking to Jigar Shah a couple of years ago, early in his role with the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, my takeaway was that the United States has devolved the ability to say “no” down to the county level—and often to the individual. Transmission is a victim of that. [LS]:If I compare it to the North Sea—where you have shallow waters, an existing oil supply chain, and an established energy region—people didn’t hesitate. In the US, as Gerard says, they’ve got so many options that any push becomes extremely political, and the moment politics shift, everything changes. I think the European developers who went from the North Sea didn’t grasp the difference in mindset. They assumed that because people spoke English, they thought the same way. But they didn’t. So offshore wind in the US—our heart is bleeding for Ørsted, but it’s lost for our generation. [GR]:Let’s move to the last one: envy. This is really my pet hate—ESG box-ticking. What we’ve seen in the last few years is companies chasing ratings and labels, telling the world they’re better than their competitors and peers. But is that real-world decarbonization? I don’t think so. Has it really improved the way businesses are governed? No. Has it really had a positive impact on society? Questionable. [MB]:My exemplar for this was when ExxonMobil scored high on ESG rankings and Tesla didn’t. There’s a lot to say about where Tesla and Musk have gone—labor practices weren’t great—but this is the leading driver of electrification of transportation in the world. Tesla created the industry as much as anything else. Tesla also does battery storage and solar at residential, commercial, and utility scale. By most standards, it’s a very virtuous company. So when it fails the ESG ranking, there’s probably something wrong with the ESG ranking. [LS]:Well, as you reminded us at the beginning, the guy who said that was the CEO of Glencore—you know, ESG, the guy ticking boxes in the sub-basement—yet it created such a bureaucracy. It’s absolutely insane, the bureaucracy ESG has created. Of course, the European Commission has piled on laws, and it’s totally out of control. But anyway, I’d say it should be EWP. We need electricians, welders, and plumbers—not ESG specialists. EWP: electricians, welders, and plumbers. [MB]:I will say that right now there are a lot of indicators that, now that we’re past the ESG bubble, real consideration for doing the right things is still proceeding—because ESG was well-intentioned. One example is that despite Trump being in office and saying “drill, baby, drill,” Wall Street has cut funding for fossil fuel investments by 25%. Many billions less are flowing into the fossil fuel industry from investors than a year ago. That’s a very good sign. I’d also say there’s a lot of green hushing going on. Many corporations are decarbonizing their operations, but it’s not being touted right now—it’s not the time to tout it. They know the needle will swing on this. They know they need to do it, and they know they’re at risk globally, regardless of what the US does.Big corporations have to operate around the world. If the US becomes a retrograde pool of polluted smoke and carbon dioxide emissions, that doesn’t mean much when they also have to operate in China, Indonesia, Australia, and Europe. [GR]:Michael, what I’d like to add—just putting my economist hat on—is: what is ESG? What was it about? The E is environmental and the S is societal. And there’s no doubt we have what are called externalities—economic life as we know it can have negative impacts on societies and the environment. So being able to measure that and show it to investors makes a lot of sense to me. What governments tend to do is tax—tax pollution, for example. That’s how we generally deal with it. But giving that visibility is very important. The G, though, is very interesting for me. You gave the example of Tesla and Exxon. Tesla scored badly on the G. Why? Because you could argue the corporate governance is not good, based on the way they’re rated. But I’d ask: why would you invest in a badly governed business in the first place? Governance is also about management and leadership. Why wouldn’t you make that a key task of a fund manager—investing in good businesses? Somehow the G got completely mixed up—not just governance, but diversity and a whole pile of other areas that aren’t actually about good governance and business leadership. I think the G is the piece disappearing. The E and the S—most people across the world will say, yes, we do have to address those. [LS]:Take care of the E and the S, yes. But the G has been totally trampled by Silicon Valley. Now there are the “god founders” with 10 votes per share, and they’ve had so much success over the past 15 years in terms of wealth creation that nobody cares about governance anymore—as long as the stock’s going up. [MB]:What I will say is that in the United States there was a shareholder-only governance model for a couple of decades—from the ’80s through the 2010s—and that is starting to shift. They’ve got B Corps and other types of corporations that allow fiduciary responsibility not just to shareholders but to multiple stakeholders, including employees and the societies they operate in. So we are seeing a broadening of that model, and shareholder-only rights in the US are fading. There’s a revolution happening, and the US is moving more toward what Europe is doing. I think that’s positive. [LS]:Okay, Gerard, can you summarize the seven sins of the energy transition before we wrap up? [GR]:I can indeed.

      "full_text": "Last Updated on:1st September 2025, 11:38 am Back in 2020, New York City presented the world with an idea for something called the Center for Climate Solutions, an ambitious brick-and-mortar research and community connections platform aimed at hyper-accelerating strategies for a sustainable future, locally and globally. Now President Donald Trump has returned to office with a powerful fossil fuel agenda in his pocket and willing enablers in Congress. Nevertheless, the Center for Climate Solutions is still on track, with the forthcoming New York Climate Exchange as its centerpiece. It seems that no-one and nothing are shielded from the long arm of the White House these days, with leading academic institutions among those in the crosshairs. However, the Center for Climate Solutions could escape the fate of other institutions if only on account of the construction timeline. The anchor tenant of the campus will be a new academic institution called the New York Climate Exchange, but they do not expect to be up and running until the fall of 2029, a good six months after President Trump leaves office — peacefully one hopes, this time. If all goes according to plan, the Center for Climate Solutions and the Climate Exchange will be housed in a new building on historic Governors Island in the New York Harbor. The former military installation totals 172 acres, of which 22 acres is controlled by the National Park Service under the National Monument network. The remaining 150 acres are owned by the City of New York and managed by the public-private organization Trust for Governors Island. Ama­zon, Con Edi­son, Don­ald A. Pels Char­i­ta­ble Trust, and New York Com­mu­ni­ty Trust are among the private sector partners supporting the Trust for Governors Island. In one sign that work continues apace, on September 1st, the top Swedish engineering firm Skanska announced that the Trust for Governors Island has contracted it to build a new substation on Governors Island at a cost of $67 million. Groundbreaking is expected before the end of the summer, with completion scheduled for 2027. That slots into the Climate Exchange timeline, which calls for groundbreaking next year in advance of the 2029 opening. “The Substation will serve several new tenant developments including a new public-school facility opening in September 2027, as well as the New York Climate Exchange, a planned 37,000 square meter research and education consortium dedicated to developing and implementingsolutions to the global climate crisisin New York City and beyond,” Skanska notes. The Climate Exchange did not just helicopter into Governors Island out of nowhere. The search for an anchor tenant began in 2020 and finally concluded with the selection of theNew York Climate Exchangeby the Center for Climate Solutions. The Climate Exchangewill function as a new branch of the sprawling State University of New York system as a project of Stony Brook University in collaboration with Oxford University and Brookhaven National Laboratory among other partners. IBM and Bloomberg Philanthropies also chipped in with a financial assist when the selection was announced. “The Exchange is a first-of-its-kind mod­el for devel­op­ing and imple­ment­ing solu­tions to the glob­al cli­mate cri­sis in New York and around the world,” the Trust for Governors Island explains. “The Exchange is a glob­al hub that lever­ages the col­lec­tive pow­er of edu­ca­tion, research, work­force devel­op­ment, pol­i­cy devel­op­ment, and pub­lic pro­gram­ming to advance cli­mate action at the local, nation­al, and glob­al level,” they add. The New York Climate Exchange is an ambitious endeavor, but it is just one project of the newly formedHar­bor Cli­mate Col­lab­o­ra­tive. The organization bills itself as “the cen­ter of a bur­geon­ing cli­mate inno­va­tion ecosys­tem in New York City.” It coordinates three powerful public-private economic engines, the Trust for Gov­er­nors Island, the New York City Eco­nom­ic Devel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion, and the Brook­lyn Navy Yard Devel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion. “The Collaborative is a key commitment of the Green Economy Action Plan, NYC’s roadmap to invest in the jobs and sectors that will help the city combat climate change, and train and position New Yorkers — particularly those from environmentally-disadvantaged communities — to benefit from the nearly 400,000 projected “green-collar” jobs in New York City by 2040,” NYC EDC explains. “As the core of New York City’sburgeoning climate innovation ecosystem, the Collaborative will invest over $725 million to advance New York’s green economy in NYCEDC’s Sunset Park District, the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and on Governors Island,” they add. If you caught that thing about 2040, that’s a good 10 years past January 20, 2029, when President Trump is scheduled to leave office, or at least that’s what he is supposed to do under the terms of the US Constitution. Regardless of what the President does or doesn’t do over the next 3-1/2 years or so, the climate crisis is not going anywhere, and neither are climate solutions. The march of technology has sustained itself throughout modern history regardless of any temporary shift in public policy. Just look at the US auto industry, where long term planning for an EV future is continuing apace, includingFordandGeneral Motorsas well as the new startupSlate Auto. Still, the Climate Exchange has been keeping itself under a low profile over the past few months. The President has plenty of room to do plenty of damage to climate planning in New York State, and New York Governor Kathy Hochul may be running out of cards to play. New York State narrowly dodged a bullet in April, when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum single-handedly broughtthe Empire Windproject to a screeching halt. Governor Hochul negotiated a restart, with the fate ofnew gas pipelinesin the state among the bargaining chips. Also on the table was a high-profile upgrade of Amtrak’s Pennsylvania Station in midtown Manhattan. New York taxpayers were originally on the hook for $1 billion in costs, but in April — during the dustup over Empire Wind — Hochul convinced Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy that the President should take all the credit for the makeover, shifting costs over to the shoulders of federal taxpayers everywhere. On August 27, Duffy announceda $43 million grant to Amtrak, aimed at fast-tracking the Penn Station. The move was enthusiastically endorsed by Hochul that same day. However, just two days later, on August 29th, Duffy announced thatNew York will lose $48 millionin Transportation Department funds that were supposed help upgrade the Arthur Kill Terminal on Staten Island for use as an offshore wind port. No word yet on reaction from Hochul’s office, or from Staten Island residents who were counting on new local employment opportunities at the port. Well, you get what you pay for. Voters on Staten Island gave the President a big thumbs-up of 64% last November.

      "full_text": "Last Updated on:1st September 2025, 11:33 am Who would like to purchase a brand new Chinese EV or PHEV online and have it delivered to their door? OK, anyone who lives in the US, put your hands down. Your government has decided you can’t have one. But for those who live in Europe, the service fromChina EV Marketplacemay be just what the doctor ordered. Not only does China EV Marketplace make it possible for European customers to purchase road legal electric cars and plug-in hybrids directly from China and have them delivered to their homes, the price can include clearing the cars through customs. Now it’s true that people can go to the port themselves to pick up their cars and deal with customs paperwork, but that extra bit of convenience is surely worth the modest amount the company charges for those services. China EV Marketplace claims to be the largest online shop for Chinese electric vehicles and serves customers worldwide. In the first half of the year, the company sold 7,000 vehicles, which was an increase of 66% compared to the first six months of 2024. However, according toCarNewsChina, this growth is mainly due to plug-in hybrids, as these are not subject to special tariffs when exported to the EU. The minimum order quantity at EV Marketplace is one vehicle, so it is open not only to commercial clients but to private customers as well. “For the first time, EV enthusiasts across Europe can order a new Chinese BEV or PHEV directly from China and have it delivered directly to their door,” explained Jakub Gersl, COO of China EV Marketplace. “Our new service removes the traditional complexities and headaches associated with international car imports.” Not only does the service apply to Chinese brands that already have an active presence in Europe, such as BYD, Xpeng, Nio, and Leapmotor, it also can import cars from companies that do not yet sell their products to the Continent. Xiaomi models in particular may appeal to Europeans, given their high performance and lower cost when compared to similar models from Tesla. In fact, China EV Marketplace will be only too happy to deliver a Tesla Model Y manufactured in Shanghai to a customer in Europe. Why would someone in Europe want to do that when the same model is being manufactured locally in Germany? The newly introduced6 passenger Model Y Lmay be a reason. Be the first on yourstrasseto own one and make all the other folks in yourNachbarschaftjealous! Volkswagen manufactures cars in China that are not available in the home market, like the ID.6X and ID.6 Crozz. These can now be imported to Europe for those who want something different. The Chinese made ID.3 is available through the online portal for about €24,000, including VAT — about €6000 less than a domestically-produced ID.3. So why isn’t everyone doing this? Because price is not the only factor when buying a new car. AsElectrivepoints out, these cars come without dealer support. Warranties? Fugeddabowdit. Parts? Nope. Service? Bring your car to the nearest dealer in Shenzen. If your car turns itself into a brick one fine morning, who you gonna call? Do you speak Cantonese? Since these vehicles are all built to Chinese specifications, they will be equipped with the Chinese GB/T charging standard, not the CCS2 connection commonly used in Europe. They need an adapter so that they can be charged at CCS2 charging points, which may affect charging performance. In addition, all controls will be labeled in Chinese and the vehicle’s operating system will be based on Chinese standards, which cannot easily be converted to other languages. Restrictions on use are also possible if the systems or apps can only communicate with Chinese servers. In addition to the prices quoted, China EV Marketplace charges $400 to clear each car through customs. Then each will need to be homologated to show it meets the local vehicle codes of the country in which it will be registered. Readers may recall that some Europeans have imported Tesla Cybertrucks to countries where safety standards are more relaxed but encountered problems when they tried to drive them in other nations where safety regulations are more rigorous. China EV Marketplace will take care of the homologation process for a fee — $1500 to $4000, depending on the model and country it is going to. In theory, customers can satisfy customs and homologation chores themselves, but that takes time and effort. When all is said and done, the extra fees and bureaucratic hassles may diminish the benefits of importing a car from China. However, the lure of having something no one else has is an intangible that you can’t put a price on. Lots of Americans are importingkeitrucksfrom Japan, where the diminutive vehicles are popular because they are cheap and fit on crowded streets. Thekeitrucks must be 25 years old before they can be legally imported to the US, and they arrive with no warranty and no parts or service network to support them, although such services are beginning to develop. People take a risk when they buy them, but they serve a market niche that domestic manufacturers choose to ignore. Speaking of trucks, China EV Marketplace will import a battery-electric Changan X2 mini box truck from Shenzen to your European country of choice at a cost of $8,090. This trucklet is perfect for inner city deliveries, but there is more to the story. Shipping can add $2,200 to $8,000 to the price, depending on destination. The customs clearance fee is $400 and the homologation fee is $3,000. The GB/T to CCS2 charging adapter is $990. Add it all up, and the low cost truck quickly more than doubles in price. Still, if it fits a particular purpose and there are no other electric vehicles that are suitable, it may be worth it. Then for those who prefer Jeep-like vehicles, there is the Baojun Yep, available in orange, green, or black for $11,200 plus tariffs, shipping, customs clearance, homologation, and charging adapter. TheBYD Seagull, sold as the Dolphin Surf in Europe, costs $10,200 plus tariffs, shipping, and all the other necessaries, but it sells in Europe for $22,900, so importing one can still save customers a significant amount of money. Will a BYD dealer in Europe service it? That’s a question you should ask before you put your money down. China EV Marketplace has been active in the United States, but will soon cease operations there. According to reports, sales figures have plummeted due to tariffs. So far, only around 30 vehicles have been sold in the US and those were to commercial customers for comparison purposes. Historically, vehicle importers have played an important role in the international auto business. For many years,Max Hoffmanwas the US importer for BMW automobiles, with a celebrated showroom in New York City.Brumos Porschein Jacksonville was instrumental in building the Porsche reputation for world class race cars. Luigi Chinetti was responsible for introducing the Ferrari marque to US customers, especially through his North American Racing Team (NART). Importing cars and trucks is big business. A little known Massachusetts auto dealer by the name of Ernie Boch made a deal to be the exclusive importer of Subarus east of the Mississippi, a move that made him a wealthy man. He used to have a yacht, the Empress Subaru, that sometimes visited Newport, RI. It was notable because it had a Subaru stowed on deck, where it could be lifted ashore via a special hoist. Those early Subarus were ugly little cars and many of Ernie Boch’s competitors thought he was crazy to get involved with an obscure Japanese automaker. Will Chine EV Marketplace become a part of automotive history? Check back in 20 years for the answer to that question.
