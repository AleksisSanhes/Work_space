    "full_text": "Москва. 3 сентября. INTERFAX.RU - Молдавские компании, летом победившие в тендере на строительство ВИЭ, ввели в эксплуатацию парк солнечных электростанций на 60 МВт, сообщило Минэнерго Молдавии. \"Все фотоэлектрические станции, разработанные инвесторами, победившими на первом аукционе на получение статуса крупного квалифицированного производителя, официально введены в эксплуатацию\", - говорится в сообщении ведомства. В июне этого года Минэнерго определило ряд молдавских компаний (названия не уточняются), которые построят объекты ВИЭ-генерации на 165 МВт, в том числе солнечные электростанции на 60 МВт, ветровые - на 105 МВт. Минэнерго также сообщило, что в августе правительство официально предоставило инвесторам статус квалифицированного крупного производителя, что позволило им заключить с госкомпанией Energocom гарантированные договоры купли-продажи электроэнергии сроком на 15 лет. Цены на электроэнергию от ВИЭ, определенные по итогам аукциона, являются одними из самых конкурентных в портфеле Energocom: 59,1 евро за 1 МВт.ч за солнечную энергию, 67,2 евро за 1 МВт.ч - за ветроэнергетику. По оценке Минэнерго, после ввода в эксплуатацию солнечных установок их доля в годовом потреблении электроэнергии в Молдавии составит около 8,4%. Ожидается, что после первого года эксплуатации доля электроэнергии из возобновляемых источников в конечном потреблении достигнет 30%. Частные инвестиции в создание ВИЭ на 165 МВт составляют около 190 млн евро. По данным Минэнерго, на конец июля общая установленная мощность ВИЭ-генерации достигла 784,09 МВт, что на 204,7 МВт больше, чем на конец 2024 года. В 2024 году ВИЭ-генерация Молдавии выработала 691 тыс. МВт.ч электроэнергии, что составило 16,7% годового потребления.",

    "full_text": "В мире продолжается гонка эффективности тандемных солнечных элементов, изготовленных с использованием перовскитов. Правда, пока эти изделия не применяются в солнечной энергетике, однако лабораторные результаты, демонстрируемые десятком известных производителей, дают надежду на коммерциализацию технологии. Тандемные ячейки, состоящие из монокристаллического кремния и перовскитных материалов, имеют теоретический предел эффективности около 43 процентов, что намного превышает возможности обычных однопереходных кремниевых солнечных элементов, составляющих основу современной солнечной энергетики. Компания Huasun Energy, крупный китайский производитель гетероструктурных (HJT) модулей, сообщила о «двух прорывах» в области тандемных солнечных элементов на основе кристаллического кремния с гетеропереходом (HJT) и перовскита. Эффективность крошечного (1 см²) «лабораторного» солнечного элемента достигла 34,02%, а крупногабаритного (210 мм) элемента в стандартных производственных условиях – 29,01%. Второй результат почти на 4% выше, чем у современных стандартных однопереходных кристаллических кремниевых солнечных элементов. Huasun утверждает, что «этот прорыв стал возможным благодаря собственной технологии нанесения крупнотекстурных тонких пленок, которая обеспечивает равномерное покрытие на сложных поверхностях и решает ключевые проблемы масштабирования перовскитных материалов. Внедрив органические стабилизаторы, Huasun улучшила равномерность осаждения и устойчивость к воздействию окружающей среды, а новые материалы для межфазного транспорта повысили надежность и совместимость технологических процессов. В совокупности эти достижения значительно приближают тандемные элементы к массовому производству». Производитель говорит, что «как только эффективность тандема превысит 30%, стоимость солнечной энергии может упастьниже одного цента США за ватт, открывая путь к конкурентоспособным по стоимости зеленому водороду и накоплению энергии» [вероятно, Huasun имеет ввиду эффективность серийных тандемных продуктов, а что касается стоимости солнечной энергии, непонятно, о чем речь; стоимость обычных ячеек составляет сегодня в Китае более четырех центов США за ватт]. В июне текущего года Trina Solarпредставилатандемный солнечный модуль мощностью 841 ватт с эффективностью 27,1%. Также в июне LONGiобъявилаоб эффективности преобразования тандемного солнечного элемента из кристаллического кремния и перовскита «большой площади» (260,9 см2) в 33%, что явилось «мировым рекордом» (для тандемных ячеек большой площади). В апреле LONGiобъявилао новом мировом рекорде эффективности преобразования энергии тандемного солнечного элемента из перовскита и кремния — 34,85% (речь идёт о малом лабораторном образце). Это только некоторые последние результаты — в этой области идёт постоянное движение. Не исключаю, что тандемная технология найдет коммерческое применение.

    "full_text": "Производство «чистой электроэнергии» в Индии выросло на 20% до новых максимумов с начала года, что дало энергетикам редкую возможность сократить производство электроэнергии на основе ископаемого топлива и снизить зависимость от импорта энергоносителей, сообщает Reuters со ссылкой на данные исследовательской компании Ember. За первую половину 2025 года индийские энергетические предприятия выработали рекордные 236 тераватт-часов (ТВт*ч) «чистой электроэнергии» (ВИЭ + АЭС). Это на 20% больше, чем за тот же период 2024 года, ипозволило генераторам сократить производство электроэнергии из ископаемого топлива на 4% по сравнению с предыдущим годом, до примерно 691 ТВт*ч. Основными факторами сталирост ветрогенерации на 29% (до 47,2 ТВт*ч) и солнечной генерации на 25% (до 85 ТВт*ч). Рекордная выработка индийской атомной энергетики (29 ТВт*ч) и рост выработки гидроэлектростанций на 14% по сравнению с прошлым годом также способствовали росту общего объема чистой электроэнергии. Что касается ископаемого топлива,выработка электроэнергии на угле снизилась на 3%по сравнению с предыдущим годом до 675 ТВт*ч, в то время как выработка электроэнергиина основе природного газасократилась на 34%до 13,75 ТВт*ч. В первой половине 2025 года общий объем чистой генерации из всех источников примерно на 24% превысил средний уровень за те же месяцы 2022-2024 гг. В июне доля чистой энергии в общем объеме генерации составила 31%, что стало самым высоким показателем за этот месяц и означало, что доля электроэнергии, вырабатываемой из ископаемого топлива, впервые опустилась ниже 70%. Данные о выработке электроэнергии в Индии в июле и августе еще не опубликованы, но, вероятно, доля чистой энергии в общем объеме генерации в этот период будет еще выше, поскольку в этот период выработка на основе ветра и гидроэлектростанций, как правило, достигает годовых пиков. Индияввела в стройрекордные 18 ГВт мощностей солнечной энергетики в первой половине 2025 года. Это указывает на дальнейший быстрый рост выработки на основе ВИЭ. Тем не менее, Индия планирует строить новые угольные ТЭС в целях «энергетической безопасности». Ожидается, что потребление электроэнергии в странебудет растина 6–6,5% в течение следующих пяти лет.

    "full_text": "Индийская группа Reliance, принадлежащая миллиардеру Мукешу Амбани, планирует начать производство на своей будущей гигафабрике по производству аккумуляторов в 2026 году. Первоначальная годовая мощность завода составит 40 ГВт*ч. Впоследствии она будет поэтапно увеличена до 100 ГВт*ч в год, объявил исполнительный директор Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) Анант Амбани на ежегодном общем собрании компании. Ранее Relianceпланироваланачать производство аккумуляторных батарей в 2023 году, и довести мощности до 50 ГВт*ч в год к 2027 году. Завод по производству аккумуляторов расположен на территории гигантского промышленного комплекса зеленой энергии Дхирубхаи Амбани в Джамнагаре, штат Гуджарат (Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga), где также размещаются крупные фабрики по производству солнечных модулей и электролизёров. Амбани сообщил, что электролизерный гигазавод RIL планируется запустить к концу 2026 года. Мощность этого объекта составит до 3 ГВт в год, что позволит производить «зелёный» водород по конкурентоспособной, по мировым меркам, цене. Кроме того, компания планирует увеличить собственное производство водорода до 3 миллионов тонн в год Завод по производству солнечных панелей ужевведен в эксплуатацию. Он успешно выпустил первые высокоэффективные гетероструктурные (HJT) солнечные модули мощностью 200 МВт. «Эти модули демонстрируют лучшие в отрасли характеристики: на 10% выше выходная мощность, на 20% выше устойчивость к температурам и на 25% ниже деградация», — сообщил Амбани. RIL планирует в ближайшие кварталы увеличить годовую производственную мощность этого предприятия до 10 ГВт с последующим расширением до 20 ГВт. Вместе эти предприятия создадут «многофункциональную экосистему чистой энергии гигаваттного масштаба», объединяющую под одной крышей оборудование для солнечной энергетики, накопления энергии и производства зеленого водорода. «Этот комплексный подход не только обеспечивает масштабируемость, но и создаёт конкурентное преимущество в плане стоимости, технологий и устойчивости цепочки поставок, позволяя Reliance получать значительную выгоду по мере ускорения глобального энергетического перехода», — сказал Амбани. «Reliance станет единственной в мире полностью интегрированной, самодостаточной компанией в области новой энергетики», — добавил он. Амбани сообщил, что работы над энергетическим комплексом Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga идут рекордными темпами. Он не будет иметь себе равных в мире по размерам, масштабу и уровню интеграции. Компания заявила, что солнечные панели, произведенные на ее заводе в Джамнагаре, поставляются в Кутч в штате Гуджарат, где она строит солнечную электростанцию, «одну из крупнейших в мире». Ранее компания говорила, что хочет построить «как минимум» 100 ГВт солнечной генерации в штате Гуджарат до 2030 года.

Компания вошла во вкус и намедни решила построить новую установку по производству зеленого водорода на другой площадке — в промышленном комплексе JSL Kalinga Nagar в Джаджпуре, Одиша. Для этого Jindal заключила соглашение с Greenzo Energy India Ltd на поставку, строительство и ввод в эксплуатацию соответствующего оборудования. Доставка запланирована в течение шести месяцев после подписания контракта. Первоначально завод будет производить 5 256 000 Нм³/год зеленого водорода (приблизительно 0,47 тысячи тонн) с последующим масштабированием до 1,5 тысячи тонн в год. Зеленый водород будет использоваться в критически важных процессах производства нержавеющей стали, что позволит Jindal Stainless выпускать зеленую сталь и значительно сократить свой углеродный след. Ранее Jindal Stainless, крупнейший производитель нержавеющей стали в Индии, официальновзял на себя обязательствадостичь углеродной нейтральности (Net Zero) до 2050 года в соответствии с методологией Инициативы по научно обоснованным целям(SBTi). В дополнение к поставке технологий, Greenzo обеспечит комплексное обучение и оперативную поддержку, включая 30 дней обучения на месте для технической команды JSL и 11 месяцев виртуального руководства, обеспечивая бесперебойную интеграцию завода и долгосрочную операционную эффективность. Сандип Агарвал, управляющий директор Greenzo Energy India Ltd, заявил: «Наши электролизерные системы, разработанные в Индии, предназначены для обеспечения эффективности, надежности и масштабируемости. Полностью отечественный щелочной биполярный электролизер оснащен разработанной в Индии технологией биполярного стека, обеспечивает выход водорода при давлении 30 бар, сверхвысокую чистоту 99,99999% и поставляется с интегрированной автоматизацией на основе SCADA и искусственного интеллекта для оптимизации в режиме реального времени и прогнозной диагностики. Мы гордимся, что поддерживаем дорожную карту чистой энергии JSL и вносим значительный вклад в миссию Индии по зеленому водороду». В августе 2021 года премьер-министр Индии Нарендра Модиобъявил о запуске «Национальной водородной миссии»(National Green Hydrogen Mission) с целью сделать Индию «глобальным центром производства, использования и экспорта зеленого водорода и его производных». Миссия нацелена на производство 5 миллионов тонн зеленого водорода к 2030 году и связанное с этим развитие мощностей возобновляемой энергетики. В феврале 2022 года Индия опубликовалаполитикув области зеленого водорода / зеленого аммиака (Green Hydrogen/ Green Ammonia Policy). В феврале нынешнего года Министерство новых и возобновляемых источников энергии Индииопубликовало«Руководящие принципы реализации пилотных проектов по использованию зеленого водорода в сталелитейном секторе» в рамках «Национальной водородной миссии». В то время пока Европа сталкивается с большими трудностями при внедрении зеленого водорода в промышленности, Индия превращается в одного из мировых лидеров водородной экономики. Свидетельством тому, например, являются выдающиесярезультатыконкурсных отборов на поставки зеленого аммиака, проходящие в стране.

    "full_text": "Компания Sinovoltaics опубликовала отчет, в котором содержатся сведения о фабриках по производству солнечных панелей и ячеек, которые строятся или запланированы к строительству в Африке и на Ближнем Востоке. В настоящее время в регионе размещены производства солнечных панелей общей мощностью 3,4 ГВт, элементов (ячеек) мощностью 2,5 ГВт и кремниевых слитков (кристаллов) на 8,05 ГВт. По данным Sinovoltaics, к 2030 году мощности по производству фотоэлектрических модулей достигнут 62,12 ГВт, солнечных элементов 52,55 ГВт, поликремния – 45 ГВт. Кроме того, ожидается создание производств металлургического кремния мощностью 290 тысяч тонн. Особенно следует подчеркнуть вертикальную интеграцию – инвесторы ориентированы не только на сборку модулей в странах Ближнего Востока и Африки, но и на создание всей цепочки, начиная с производства поликремния. Это позволит закрыть местные потребности и также обеспечить экспорт на рынки, которые закрыты или закрываются от китайских изделий по политическим и/или протекционистским причинам, основной из которых – США. Кроме того, близость региона к Европе потенциально позволит заместить продукцию из Юго-Восточной Азии в европейском импорте. В отчете перечислены 27 производственных площадок, которые обозначены на приложенной карте. Разумеется, среди инвесторов много китайских компаний, в том числе такие гранды, как JinkoSolar и JA Solar. В июле 2024 года Саудовская Аравияпривлеклакитайских инвесторов для создания гигантских производств кремниевых пластин, солнечных модулей и ветряных турбин. Намедниотмечалось, что импорт солнечных панелей из Китая вырос в Африке на 60% за последние 12 месяцев (июль 2024-июнь 2025) и составил 15,03 ГВт. Это свидетельствует о быстром росте солнечной энергетике на континенте. В марте текущего годасообщалось, что японский производитель фотоэлектрических элементов и модулей Toyo Solar планирует увеличить свои мощности по выпуску солнечных элементов (ячеек) в Эфиопии до 4 ГВт. В 2024 году компания EliTe Solarобъявилаоб инвестициях в создание производственного комплекса по выпуску фотоэлектрических ячеек и модулей годовой мощностью 8 ГВт в Суэцкой китайско-египетской зоне экономического и торгового сотрудничества (TEDA Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone) в Египте.

The 37,709 deliveries of August 2025 were just 3% higher than the July 2025 total — but they did reach a new monthly record for the company. Across the first 8 months of the year, XPENG completed 271,615 deliveries. That’s 252% more than in the first 8 months of 2024! Now, one might be concerned that XPENG’s sales growth is now plateauing and the company soon won’t be able to highlight massive year-over-year sales increases. As you can see in the charts above and below, XPENG’s vehicle sales spiked in about November 2024 due to significant production and sales progress. Perhaps it will be hard to sustain the rapid growth we’ve been seeing, but XPENG does have an answer on the table. That’s the all-new P7. Deliveries have already begun in the past few days. Last but not least, XPENG customers are apparently ready for the future and very into the company’s advanced driver-assist technology. “In August 2025, XNGP achieved an urban driving monthly active user penetration rate of 85%,” XPENG shares. “Since its introduction, the human-AI co-pilot feature has been well-received and widely embraced by users.” Indeed.

That story was based on joint reporting byVtDiggerandGrist. While it was primarily about Vermont,Gristwent on to explore in detail the efforts Charles and David Koch have made to shape America according to their own philosophy, which glorifies fossil fuels. Americans for Prosperity was founded in 2004 byCharles Kochand his brother David, who died in 2019. Together they amassed great wealth through Koch Industries, an oil refinery and pipeline conglomerate that has gobbled up many other companies since their father, Fred Koch, created the business in the 1930s. Fred Koch had an idea for refining petroleum that was spurned by the US government and other oil companies, so he put it to use to provide fuels to the Russian and German military machines. The fact that millions died as a result was immaterial to Fred. He was a first-generation immigrant whose father moved to Texas from the Netherlands. He never forgave the US for spurning his ideas and became a co-founder of the John Birch Society in 1958. The group was part of what many thought of as the lunatic fringe, as it battled integration and the liberation of women. Presumably, his sons were treated to daily anti-government diatribes by their father during their formative years. Now, today, the nutso ravings of Fred Koch are the bedrock of the MAGA effort to overthrow the Constitution. For an excellent analysis of the rise ofKoch power, readers are encouraged to read the in-depth article “The Making Of The Koichtopus” in the November 3, 2014 edition ofMother Jones. Suffice it to say that the Kochs were founders of the Tea Party movement that clamored for lower taxes, less government regulation, and more power for the individual states. The war on deregulation is interesting, because while decrying federal regulations, the Kochs took advantage of one government regulation that encouraged refineries to accept the gunk coming from the Alberta tar sands. No one else in America could process the stuff except a small refinery in the Midwest. When even it found the business unprofitable, it put the refinery up for sale as a distressed asset and the Kochs swooped in and bought it. That refinery became the basis of their empire, which means their wealth is based on the dirtiest, filthiest, most polluting source of oil known. And absent federal government support, it never would have happened. As the Koch empire grew, Charles used his increasing political power to wrest concessions from Congress that altered the IRS code to allow special interest groups like Americans For Prosperity to operate in secret, thereby setting the stage for the dark money era. His fingerprints are all over the Federalist Society that counts six of the current members of the Supine Court among its distinguished alumni. USSC decisions like Citizens United are the result of Charles’ constant agitating in the shadows. The court will shortly overturn a federal appeals court decision that found most of the tariffs imposed by the current administration were imposed illegally. When it does, there will be no restraints on the horrors the administration has in store. Amplifying the power of the president is one of the most cherished goals of Charles Koch and his minions. The Koch fingerprints are also all over the hate-filled Project 2025, created by another Koch instrumentality — the Heritage Foundation. Project 2025 is the distillation of all the hatred Fred Koch harbored for the federal government and marks Charles Koch as the most powerful person in America that almost no one has ever heard of. Thanks toGrist, he is now getting the notoriety he so richly deserves. Every sordid detail about the Koch influence is documented in Jane Mayer’s exquisite exposéDark Money. Gristsays the Kochs have used their “wealth to remake the national GOP into the party of climate denial after government regulation of pollution and a push for renewables threatened their oil empire. In 2008, they began the ‘No Climate Tax Pledge,’ asking officials to vote against spending money to fight climate change without equivalent tax cuts. By 2013, 411 officials had signed, including a quarter of senators and a third of representatives, along with other leaders like US Attorney General Pam Bondi.” Greenpeace has called the Kochs the “financial kingpin of climate science denial and clean energy opposition,” partnering with and then outspending better known oil corporations like ExxonMobil. During the first Trump administration, they launched local campaigns through Americans for Prosperity toroll back vehicle emissions standards. The Koch-funded networks have heavily influenced both Trump terms. In the first term, about 50 administration officials had ties to Koch networks, including Energy Secretary Rick Perry and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. Today, key figures like Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have worked closely with and donated large sums to both Americans for Prosperity and other Koch-affiliated groups,Gristreports. The summer campaign in Vermont comes as the second Trump administration launches an unprecedented attack on the climate and clean energy policies that gained traction under the Biden administration. Along with deleting climate information and reports from federal websites, the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy have spent six months deregulating fossil fuels and slashing clean energy projects. Project 2025 calls for breaking up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the nation’s premier climate science agency, calling it “one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry.” Trump’s 2026 budget proposal eliminates the agency’s research arm, which is responsible for helping the country adapt to climate change. For Ross Connolly, the head of Americans For Prosperity in New England, his lurch to the right came during college, when he readRoad to Serfdomby Friedrich Hayek. According toWikipedia: “The Road to Serfdom is a book by the Austrian-British economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek. In the book, Hayek ‘[warns] of the danger of tyranny that inevitably results from government control of economic decision-making through central planning.’ “He further argues that the abandonment of individualism and classical liberalism inevitably leads to a loss of freedom, the creation of an oppressive society, the tyranny of a dictator, and the serfdom of the individual. Hayek challenged the view, popular among British Marxists, that fascism (including Nazism) was a capitalist reaction against socialism. He argued that fascism, Nazism, and state-socialism had common roots in central economic planning and empowering the state over the individual.” According to Mayer’sDark Money, that book has also had a powerful influence on Charles Koch. The irony is that the policies of Americans For Prosperity in particular, and Charles Koch in general, will result in precisely the consequences predicted by Hayek — making serfs of us all, especially people of color and women, who in the wonderful world of MAGA, will be relegated to the role of breeders with no dominion over their own bodies. Do you suppose Charles Koch understands that by unleashing the forces of evil he champions, he would be subject to deportation if the government decides to end birthright citizenship? Naah, frankly, he seems unable to think that deeply or appreciate how the words of his mentor have metastasized into a system that will make serfs of us all. How ironic that by pedaling furiously to avoid serfdom, he has led the country to precisely that result. After graduating from college, Connolly worked for Republican campaigns before joining Americans for Prosperity in 2013. AFP has since expanded to 37 state chapters, but the only chapter in the six New England states is in New Hampshire. Eventually, AFP could establish a chapter in Vermont, which would give it infrastructure and full-time staff, and enable a permanent presence in the state. “We promise we will be here for the long term,” Connolly told the audience at Rutland. “We at AFP are not going anywhere.” And we who value democracy and individual liberty will oppose you at every step of the way, Ross, in Vermont and every other state, with every fiber of our beings. You are making America into a new feudal society as you prostrate yourself before the alter of oil. The thirty pieces of silver you get for spreading your message of hate will never be enough to expiate your sins. The only Americans who will prosper in the Kochtocracy to come are those who are already wealthy. Selling the dream of prosperity to the rest of us is a cruel joke, and it is quite amazing how many do not realize how, in the final analysis, the joke is on them.

    "full_text": "Philippine telecommunications giant Globe is set to transition over 3,000 of its cell sites and other low-energy facilities in Metro Manila and the CALABARZON region to 100% renewable energy by 2028. This significant expansion of its clean energy portfolio is being enabled by the country’s Retail Aggregation Program (RAP), a policy framework that allows companies to bundle the power demands of multiple small sites to procure electricity from a single retail supplier. This initiative marks the first time a telecommunications company in the Philippines has utilized the RAP framework at this scale. It represents a strategic step beyond previous clean energy sourcing methods and provides a model for how large enterprises with geographically distributed infrastructure can effectively access the renewable energy market. The transition is projected to source 80 million kilowatt-hours of clean electricity annually. Initiated by the Philippine Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), the Retail Aggregation Program is a key enabler for this large-scale transition. For a company like Globe, whose network consists of thousands of sites with individual energy needs too small to qualify for other programs, RAP is a game-changer. “We are grateful to the ERC for listening to our challenges. With RAP, we are able to address the urgent need to reduce emissions at scale,” said Yoly Crisanto, Globe’s Chief Sustainability and Corporate Communications Officer. “By expanding our sourcing of renewable energy to thousands of additional sites, we are taking deliberate steps toward our Net Zero goals and proving that clean energy is not only viable but necessary across all operational levels.” The shift of these 3,000+ sites is expected to reduce Globe’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by an estimated 5.5 million kilograms of CO₂ equivalent (5,500 metric tons) each year. This directly supports the company’s commitments under the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which include a target to achieve a 42% reduction in absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2030 and a long-term goal to reduce absolute emissions across all scopes by 90% by 2050, using 2021 as a baseline. The collaboration with energy supplier ACEN RES highlights a broader corporate strategy within their parent company, the Ayala Group. “This collaboration with Globe reflects the strength of synergies across the Ayala group in driving meaningful climate action,” commented Irene Maranan, ACEN SVP and Head for Communications & Sustainability. “By enabling the shift of over 3,000 sites to renewable energy, we are not only accelerating Globe’s Scope 2 emissions reduction, but also advancing our collective net zero ambition as a group.” The move also aligns with the Philippine Department of Energy’s national target of increasing the share of renewables in the country’s energy mix to 35% by 2030 and 50% by 2040.

    "full_text": "Last Updated on:3rd September 2025, 12:05 am With the untimely death of the EV tax credit looming just a few weeks away on September 30, General Motors is among the US automakers celebrating a last-minute EV sales bonanza. The celebrating will most likely dissolve into tears come October. Nevertheless, GM has made it clear that EVs are here to stay, and the company’s head of North America operations has just explained how they expect to weather the coming storm. GM has hadgreat funwith its status asthe #2 EV sellerin the US over the past couple of years, topped only by longtime industry leader Tesla. The fun continued into August, when GM added up the numbers to total sales of21,000 EVsfrom its Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC branches combined. “August was our best month everfor EV sales — and we expect that buying surge to pay long-term dividends,” notes Duncan Aldred, Senior VP and President of GM North America. “GM remains the #2 EV seller, driven by strong demand for vehicles like the Chevrolet Equinox EV, the Cadillac LYRIQ, and the GMC Sierra EV,” he added, in an article posted on the company’s website on September 2. In the same post, Aldred dropped a hint about why the company is confident in the long-term staying power of the EV market, citing “EV customers’ overwhelming commitment to the technology.” That’s shorthand for surveys that show that most EV drivers will stick with an EV for their next vehicle. Somewhat oddly, none other than Shell recently surveyed EV drivers in Europe, the US, and China. “Signalling a strong commitment tothe transition towards electric mobility, nine in ten (91%) current EV drivers (both Battery EVs and Plug-in Hybrid EVs) indicate they would consider another EV as their next vehicle,” Shell noted. Aldred also took note of GM’s track record on manufacturer loyalty, referring to the likelihood that anyone who buys from GM will come back around to GM the next time they need another vehicle. That’s not just GM’s opinion. In February, the company gave itself a pat on the back for earning the Highest Overall Manufacturer Loyalty award from S&P Global Mobility for the 10th consecutive year in 2024. “For a decade now,if you drive a GM vehicle, you’re more likely to stick with our brands than to go to a competitor when you buy your next ride,” GM emphasized. That’s all well and good, but the loss of the $7,500 federal tax credit is going to sting. In the same blog post, Aldred affirmed that GM is cutting back on EV production in anticipation of a near-term drop in EV sales after September 30. However, Duncan also emphasized that GM intends to ride out the storm. He notes that the company was seeing its EV sales on the upswing before the tax credit came into being as a provision of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which he attributes to GM’s focus on the affordability end of the EV market as well as the luxury end. All else being equal, the company expects to see sales continue in those categories, through the company’s high-end Cadillac EVs along with the Chevrolet Equinox and the forthcoming rebirth of the affordable Chevy Bolt. If all goes according to plan, Duncan also expects more and more sales from the company’s Chevrolet, GMC, and Hummer pickup trucks and SUVs. That remains to be seen, but GM also has a trump card to play, so to speak. If more people don’t want to buy more EVs over the coming months, that’s just fine with GM. “As we adjust to the new EV market realities, the strength of our ICE portfolio will continue to separate our brands from the pack and give us flexibility and profitability that EV-only companies lack,” Duncan notes. Hmm … who is he referring to? Duncan’s comments about EV-only companies seem directed mainly at small-scale startups, but Tesla also comes in for its share of ribbing. “Meanwhile, we are seeing marginal competitors dramatically scale back their products and plans, which should end much of the overproduction and irrational discounts we’ve seen in the marketplace,” Aldred wrote, most likely referring toTesla’s Cybertruck debacle. Thediscountingtrend over at Tesla surfaced last year, when signs of weakness in the company’s sales began to surface.The discountscontinued into this year as sales began to slide off a cliff. Still, GM and other automakers have a long hill to climb if they will ever catch up to Tesla on EV sales. Despite Tesla’s ongoingbrand reputation crisis, the company still accounted foralmost 50%of all EV sales in the US in Q2 of this year. “With almost 144,000 sales, Tesla had more than four times as many sales as #2 Chevrolet,”CleanTechnicaeditor Zachary Shahan observed on August 31, adding that “Ford and Hyundai are in a tight race for #3, with 5.5% and 5.3% share of the US EV market, respectively.” GM’s optimistic outlook on the strength of long-term EV sales is somewhat tempered by an apparent plateauing of interest among the general car-buying public. “EV share of the overall US auto marketdropped to 7.4% in the second quarter, down year over year from 8.1% in Q2 2024, and also down quarter over quarter from 7.6% in Q1 2025…7.4% EV market share is the worst its been since Q1 2024 when the share was 7.2%,”CleanTechnicanoted on September 1. That tracks with the aforementioned Shell survey. In contrast to the high number of EV drivers who look forward to their next EV purchase, Shell found that more ICE drivers were less inclined to try out an EV. Persistent gaps in public EV charging availability as well as shortcomings in the public charging experience can take part of the blame. GM sees that hurdle melting away. “By the end of the year, our customers will have access to more than 65,000 public fast-charging bays across the country. We expect that will grow to more than 80,000 by the end of next year and 100,000 by the end of 2027 — a more than 50% improvement in just three years,” Aldred wrote, citing the EVGo andIONNAfast charging networks as well as its own GM Energy branch. With affordability top of mind, GM also expects new low-costLFP (lithium iron phosphate) batteriesto sustain its long-term EV sales profile into the future, regardless of the shifting winds of federal electrification policy. After all, EV technology isn’t going anywhere, but US presidents come and go every 4–8 years. Meanwhile, GM has been around since 1908.

    "full_text": "Tobias Alando is right:localization is key if Kenya is to unlock the full promise of electric mobility. The EV sector is not a theoretical opportunity anymore — it is here, and it aligns with three urgent national priorities: creating jobs, improving public health, and strengthening the fiscal base. But if we are to succeed, localization must be framed more broadly than just assembling vehicles. For nearly 40 years, the real disruptor of Kenya’s auto industry has been second-hand imports, now over 80% of the market. EVs are not the enemy — they are the lever to transform both our industrial and energy landscape. Every EV on the road consumes locally generated power for its entire lifetime, displacing imported fossil fuels that drain our foreign reserves. Kenya already generates over 90% of its electricity from renewable sources, with significant surplus capacity during off-peak hours. EV adoption can absorb that idle clean energy, spur new investment into green generation, and — critically — help lower energy costs for households, businesses, and manufacturers alike. In this sense, energy itself should be considered “local content.” The benefits extend beyond economics. Shifting even 10% of new vehicle registrations to EVs would sharply cut urban air pollution, reduce noise on our streets, and unlock consumer savings through lower operational costs. This is industrialization and environmental health working hand in hand. To truly compete, however,Kenyamust pivot assembly efforts toward areas where the opportunity curve is steepest — “chargers, battery packs, and key EV components.” These technologies are scalable, transferrable, and well-suited to building regional value chains. From there, we can graduate into low-volume commercial EVs and eventually passenger cars. Policy must align across three fronts: Kenya’s current competitive advantage is clear: we generate over 90% of our electricity from renewable sources. This is a foundation most countries envy. Add to that a youthful, educated population hungry for opportunity, and it’s evident that the path to prosperity lies in creating jobs — both formal and informal — anchored in affordable energy. For most of these jobs, the cost of electricity is the single biggest input. That is why, as we discuss “local content” in the automotive industry, we must broaden the definition. It cannot only be about parts and assembly. Renewable, locally generated power is itself local content. Let’s agree on this: importing Fully Built Units (FBUs) exports jobs to the source markets. But so too does importing fossil fuels. The critical difference is that every EV, whether locally assembled or imported fully built, runs on 100% locally generated power. That translates into local jobs not only in the auto sector, but also across manufacturing, services, and the wider economy. Here is the scale of what this means. Scenario B (medium) shows the potential within the next 5–7 years: Together, that is ~1.19 TWh annually, or about three times the energy Kenya currently curtails from its grid. After absorbing today’s wasted 300–400 GWh, EV growth would require 120–150 MW of new clean generation capacity. That’s not a burden, it’s an opportunity. EV adoption becomes the engine that pulls new geothermal, wind, and solar projects to market, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of cheaper energy and stronger industrial competitiveness. By treating “green energy as local content,” EVs give us a double win: they secure jobs in the automotive value chain while simultaneously anchoring new employment in energy, industry, and services. This is how localization and electrification, working together, can transform Kenya’s economy.

    "full_text": "Over the last year, we here atCleanTechnicahave been compiling survey data about rooftop solar installations. The analysis stage of our project is just beginning, but it’s clear from the get-go that rooftop solar owners want to share their experiences — to help others, but also to affirm that solar is a viable, reliable, and powerful source of energy for homes and businesses. As we start to digest the responses, one question is at the forefront of our minds: what makes people want to buy and install rooftop solar? What broad themes emerged from our survey about consumer motivation to install rooftop solar? Each householdhasits own particular primary goal as they investigate becoming rooftop solar owners. Take our friends, Ted and Nancy, whohave8 solar panels on the roof of their 1200-square-foot lake house in New Jersey, where they spend about 5 months of the year. Their rooftop solar motivation arose from the need to add electricity to their off-grid home, which is quite distinct from many consumers who have gone the solar route. For these NJ homeowners, the cost of installation wasn’t as important as the end results of electrical access. In ourCleanTechnicasurvey responses, financial savings and energy independence were two of the top reasons to invest in rooftop solar. Understanding the capitalization of solar installations into home values is especially interesting because adding a solar system is one of the most expensive changes homeowners can make. But that’s not the only cost that consumers take into account when considering rooftop solar for their home or business. The ability to save money was one of the primary reasons why our survey respondents said they had installed rooftop solar. Solar’s return on investment and drop in monthly bills was a strong motivator. According to the US Energy Information Administration, the average US electric bill is $132.17, based on data collected from 2023. Connecticuthasthe second highest electrical costs; only Hawai’i is higher. Perhaps that is why Connecticutstands outfor the state’s early effort to broaden access to rooftop solar, specifically to low- and moderate-income residents, through incentive projects under their Residential Solar Investment Program (RSIP). After implementation of the RSIP, participation in rooftop solar opened up to new communities, and that the median observed growth rate in rooftop solar adoption doubled throughout the state. Rooftop solar can reduce energy costs and, therefore, reduce energy burden. More and more homeowners are turning to solar power to reduce their carbon footprint and save on monthly electricity bills. But how much can you actually expect to save on electricity bills after installing solar panels? The average savings from solar panels varies, based on state electricity rates and other factors like average sun hours, usage, local incentives, location, system size, and electricity consumption. Data from EcoFlowpointsto an average residential solar array with a power output of 7.15 kW. Assuming an average of 4.5 peak sun hours per day, this system would have a daily production of 32.2 kWh and a monthly output of around 965 kWh. Considering the US average monthly electricity usage of 886 kWh, a 7.15 kW solar array would produce more than this and could save the average homeowner the pre-solar cost for electricity. The average US household can expect to save around $1,500 on their electricity bills annually. This estimate indicates that solar panels can provide significant long-term savings for homeowners. There’s another caveat that isn’t widely discussed. Solar power costs are stable for years, but utility prices frequently rise. Rooftop solar owners have confidence knowing that the cost to power their homes or businesses will not soar due to factors beyond their control. In ourCleanTechnicasurvey, respondents shared how important rooftop solar was for energy independence and self-sufficiency. Energy self-sufficiency is the capability to satisfy energy needs without depending on others. Most consumers yearn to attain a certain degree of self-sufficiency for energy security, and rooftop solarhas been widely identifiedas being critical to achieving such goals. Achieving complete energy independence through solar power is a powerful financial decision thattransformsa home into a self-sustaining entity. Contemporary solar technology, coupled with advanced battery storage systems, now makes it possible for home and business owners to generate, store, and manage their own electricity year-round. This shift away from traditional utility dependence offers more than just lower monthly bill; it provides protection against rising energy costs, power outages, and grid instability, while increasing property value. The ease of integration of this technology in the residential sector is a real advantage of this technology. So, too, is its high economic return compared to the level of risk: its profitabilityis directly proportionalto the cost of electricity. As a result, these rooftop solar installations have become extremely interesting to consumers, as their profitability increases when the cost of electricity rises. Indeed (excepting the US with the current anti-renewables Trump administration) the implications of strategic PV deployment for regional self-sufficiency by 2050are gainingtraction. Solar poweristhe fastest way and least expensive way to add more electricity to the nation’s electricity grid. The US solar industryadded8.6 gigawatts (GW) of new solar module manufacturing capacity in Q1 2025, marking the third-largest quarter for new manufacturing capacity on record. The development of complementary energy technologies such as vehicle-to-grid capability, smart homes, and battery energy storage systems has stimulated consumer awareness of the combined benefits of rooftop solar and other technologies. Some households adopt multiple sustainable energy technologies as part of a larger equation as they add rooftop solar, such as plug-in electric vehicles, battery energy storage systems, smart appliances, smart thermostats, and more. Most of these additions are phased in rather than installed concurrently. In the past 15 years, residential rooftop solarhas gonefrom a niche curiosity to a common sight in many neighborhoods around the US. For example, in the US states of Connecticut and Massachusetts, nearly 9% of all homes have solar. This is important because it means that residential solar now has the potential to influence housing markets. We’ll continue to explore the results of ourCleanTechnicasurvey over the next few weeks. Respondents offered a good deal of interesting information and commentary that we’ll share periodically. Stay tuned.

    "full_text": "So much for “American Energy Dominance.” US President Donald Trump’s war on wind energy is killing off thousands of jobs here at home, while rival superpower China is gleefully taking its wind industry on the road to pick up ripe targets in the eastern parts of Europe, among other areas. The latest example is the Balkan nationBosnia and Herzegovina, where a new 84-megawatt wind farm began churning out the clean kilowatts earlier this year. The Balkan Peninsula is a mother lode of renewable energy potential, including hydropower, biomass, geothermal, and solar as well as wind energy, and that includes Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Investors are already on the case. Earlier this yearthe BiH Independent System Operatorran the numbers and came up with a total of 3.8 gigawatts in new wind farms under development through 2035, along with 12.5 gigawatts of solar. Into this mix jumps POWERCHINA, the Power Construction Corporation ofChina.

The two projects “represent a significant step for Chinese-built power equipment inEastern Europe,” CRI noted in a press release, adding that the ventures “also reflect a broader effort to align Chinese and European technical standardsin support of global climate goals.” A generating capacity of 84 megawatts is fairly modest by today’s standards, but the Ivovik project will claim the title of the largest renewable energy project in BiH to date, with an annual output of 259 million kilowatt-hours. “According to project figures, that output could displace roughly 240,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions per year,” CRI stated. CRI also used the occasion to point out that the new wind farm will have an outsized impact on China’s footprint in the global wind energy industry, in Europe and beyond. “The Ivovik project is notable as the first foreign-concession energy venture in BiH and the country’s first renewable development led by a Chinese firm,” CRI emphasized. For the record, the Ulog hydropower project is the also first of its kind to be developed by a Chinese firm in BiH. “For POWERCHINA, the developments highlight the company’s growing role in Europe’s clean-energy buildout,” CRI noted. “Company officials describe the Ivovik and Ulog projects as ‘a bridge’ between China and BiH—both in strengthening renewable infrastructure and in signaling broader cooperation on climate and energy transition.” In contrast, news organizations here in the US don’t much in the way to report about broader cooperation on climate action and the energy transition between the US and BiH or, for that matter, between the US and any other country. Instead, they are left trying to make sense of an “American Energy Dominance” policy that throttles down the nation’s two most abundant and accessible energy resources — the sun and the wind — in favor of fossil fuels along with a generoushodgepodge of other renewablesincluding geothermal, hydropower, and biomass, withmarine energyalso making the cut. Anyone trying to rationalize this heady brew might as well pack up, go home, and while away the hours picking lint out of their bellybutton. That would be a more productive use of time than attempting to describe why the Commander-in-Chief is waging war against wind energy as well as solar, while other renewables enjoy the protective embrace of American Energy Dominance. The obvious answer, of course, is that the war on wind energy is a simple matter of personal spite, writ large with all the wealth and power a self-dealing grifter can muster, with solar energy thrown in as collateral damage. Conveniently, wind and solar are the only two domestic energy resources that fail to reach the Trump administration’santiquated “reliability” bar. The well-documented roots of Trump’s obsession with wind energy go back to the years leading up to his first successful bid for the White House. In 2012 hisnew golf course at Aberdeen in Scotlandopened for business, and the next year he sued to stop 11 offshore wind turbines from being installed within sight of the new venture. “He was furious when the Scottish government approved plans for the renewable energy development within sight of his multi-million pound golf development on the Menie estate, north of Aberdeen,” notedBBC, among many other news organizations tracking the battle. “He saidthe turbines would spoil the view,”BBCadded. Oh the irony, it burns. Golf courses themselves represent view spoilage on a massive scale, reducing the natural ramble of existing landscapes to stiffened swaths of cropped grass, where order is maintained with chemical treatments and greenhouse gas-spewing grounds equipment. In terms of the spoilage of views, the Menie golf project was particularly egregious because the construction workdamaged protected dunesthat Trump had promised to preserve. In 2020, Scottish environmental authorities determined that the damage was severe and irreversible, thereby removing the dunes from protection altogether. Trump or no Trump, the global wind industry, of course, is not going anywhere. The technology is not going away, either. Wind energy, onshore and off, will continue to feature in the power generation plans of nations around the world. After all, the wind isn’t going to stop blowing. Meanwhile, offshore wind energy stakeholders here in the US tried to catch Trump’s attention on the heels of Election Day last year, including the trade organization Oceantic Network. On November 6, Oceantic president Liz Burdock emphasized that the industry sprawls far beyond the turbines themselves to embracea 39-state supply chainthat employs thousands of workers in manufacturing, ship-building, and upgrades to seaport infrastructure, among other elements. Bellybutton, meet lint. Despite the clear potential for killing off thousands of jobs in red and blue state alike, Trump followed through with his vendetta against wind energy upon taking office, the offshore industry being a particularly ripe target because it depends on leases issued by the Interior Department.The offshore lease programwas the first to fall under the axe, and the rug has also been been ripped out from underpartly-finished wind projectsby order of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. Adding insult to injury, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy chipped in his two cents last week, clawing back$679 million in federal fundingfor 12 different seaport upgrade projects. The upgrades would have benefited other industries in addition to the offshore wind industry. Clinging to one last shred of hope, later this week 18 Democratic attorneys general will appearin federal courtto argue that the Trump administration has no authority to review, let alone stop, offshore wind energy projects that are already in the pipeline.

    "full_text": "Vermont, with its rolling hills, hidden valleys, and rushing mountain streams, is of the most beautiful states in the nation. During a recent visit, I saw a Subaru with a bumper sticker that said, “Practice Civility.” Vermonters tend to be practical folks, with a strong understanding of what’s right, and good, and decent about America. It was the first state to pass a“polluters pay” lawmodeled after the federal Superfund law that seeks to force those who damage the environment to bear the cost of cleaning up their mess.Green Mountain Poweris actively promoting virtual power plant technology and the state is supportive ofcommunity solar. Vermonters do not shout about their politics from the highest mountain top and are tolerant of those who have different views.. It has a Democratic legislature, a Republican governor, and a Senator who is fiercely independent. The people who live there are not “woke,” but tolerant of those who march to the beat of a different drummer. Naturally, the Heritage Foundation, the Koch supported organization that gave us Project 2025, cannot stand to see a state that is so respectful of others. Therefore, it has sent its operatives, working under the guise of Americans For Prosperity, into Vermont to teach Vermonters how to hate others, strip people of their access to affordable health care, force women to dedicate their reproductive organs to the glorification of the state, and destroy science and education in all forms. A joint investigative report byVtDiggerandGristreveals that Americans for Prosperity, a radical right wing organization whose members are known to foam at the mouth over climate science, is now testing its playbook in Vermont. That campaign is being led by Ross Connolly, the group’s 34-year-old northeast regional director, who calls Vermont “bizarro-New Hampshire.” A political opportunist from New Hampshire, he says,”I could talk endlessly about all the good things New Hampshire’s doing and all the bad things that Vermont has done.” In July, he wrote that “the state’s progressive majority has chosen to inflate taxes and increase regulations” and “advance their own radical agenda.” “So many groups on the right, center-right, don’t get involved in the northeast outside of New Hampshire or Pennsylvania,” Connolly said in an interview this month. “If we don’t fight for people in those areas, we’re never going to make any sort of difference.” Americans for Prosperity claims its mission is helping Vermonters afford to live in the state. But it was founded by two brothers who made their fortune in the oil business and who devoted their lives to attacking climate science. Wealthy people typical have a low regard for ordinary folks trying to make ends meet every day. Things are not going particularly well for AFP in the Green Mountain State. A rally in Rutland this summer drew just 15 people, half of them politicians hoping to attract attention to their campaigns. In addition to Connolly, AFP has two other operatives in Vermont — Rachel Burgin, who lives in Georgia, and Lauren Schley, whose LinkedIn page says she works for Americans for Prosperity out of Washington, D.C. Vermont residents who are actively working to spread the gospel according to AFP? Zero, so far as anyone can tell. One thing that sticks in the craw of Americans For Prosperity is a Vermont initiative to promote heat pumps for residences and business. That program has beenhighly successful in Maine, where propane and oil companies engaged in a campaign of distortions and half truths in an attempt to kill the initiative. They failed, and today the demand for heat pumps in Maine is growing every year. If AFP was truly interested in helping Vermonters afford to heat their homes in the winter, they would back the heat pump initiative simply because those devices are two to three times more efficient than propane and oil furnaces. In essence, they give more heat per dollar than propane or oil heat, which means they lower the cost of staying warm dramatically. But that cuts into the profits of propane and oil companies. By its actions, AFP shows it doesn’t care a flying fig about people; it only cares about preserving fossil fuel company profits. State Senator Anne Watson says groups like Americans for Prosperity opposed the energy transition because it undercut the profits of its oil tycoon founders. “Vermonters need to be savvy about that, and recognize when outside influence is coming in to try and affect our policies and our elections.” “Vermont was considering this first-of-its-kind clean heat standard that would hold fossil fuel companies to a standard of actually reducing carbon emissions in a way that the electric utility sector has had to do for decades,” said Elena Mihaly, vice president for the Vermont chapter of the Conservation Law Foundation, a clean energy advocacy group based in New England. “They were trying to nip it in the bud here in Vermont before it got out.” Watson added, “We know Vermonters care about climate change, and they care about affordability. Both of those things are met by advancing renewables and renewable energy sources in the state because the vast majority are cheaper than their fossil fuel counterparts.” Americans For Prosperity should really be called Oil Billionaires In Search Of Bigger Profits. It is against federal subsidies for energy programs that could lower energy costs for low income Vermonters. The Green Mountain State was in line to receive $62.5 million under theSolar For Allprogram, but that money was eliminated by the One Big Beautiful Bill earlier this year that took a sledgehammer to federal clean energy initiatives. “We believe those subsidies should have ended,” Connolly said of Solar for All, but conveniently forgot to add that the massive federal subsidies that coal, oil, and methane companies get. Hypocrisy is rampant on the far right, which welcomes subsidies that favor its supporters but scream bloody murder when someone else — especially poor people — receive any benefit from the government. How these people can face themselves in the mirror every morning is an enduring mystery. When OBBB passed, AFP held a One Big Beautiful Bash to celebrate the fact that low income American families would now be forced to buy more expensive oil and propane to heat their homes. That should tell you all you need to know about these grifters. Instead of renewables, Connolly said the region needed more small nuclear reactors, as well as the expansion of natural gas pipelines. He forgot to mention that small nuclear reactor technology does not currently exist at commercial scale and may never do so. Predictably, AFP is also opposed to the Vermont Climate Superfund Act, which charges oil companies for greenhouse gas emissions between 1995 and 2024. The law applies a “polluter pays” mindset to climate recovery, potentially giving Vermont resources to build back from disasters like recent devastating floods. “If your concern is climate change, that does absolutely nothing to solve climate change,” Connolly said. “It’s sort of petty type politics where it’s like, we’re going after Big Oil and punishing them. Vermont isn’t going to bankrupt ExxonMobil or any of these companies. You’re just going to drive them out of your state and drive energy costs higher because of it.”Translation: We should be free to spread our filthy emissions throughout the environment and force others to clean up our mess. Charles Koch loves to wrap his warped ideas in the flag. The words “American” and “Heritage” figure prominently in the names of several pressure groups he has founded and supports financially. His Heritage Foundation created the hate-filled Project 2025 that the current failed administration is using as a playbook to undo much of the progress made by women and people of color over the past 50 years. The people of Vermont are free to decide how they want to address the gathering storm of climate change any way they want, but they should be fully informed about the motivations of those who want to influence their thinking. While in Vermont last week, I had a chance to meet with Jock Gill, a college classmate who lives in Peacham. Jock was directly involved in the installation of a community solar system in his town and he has some thoughts about AFP and its campaign. When it comes to the constant complaints by fossil fuel companies about subsidies for renewable energy, he counters that the oil depletion allowance, added to the tax code in 1926, “dwarfs any green energy support. Either we should support green energy at the same level or we should cancel the depletion allowance altogether. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander. Symmetry is key to fairness and justice.” He went on to say, “A key question is why do the conservative groups want to impose the most expensive energy with the least energy security and weak energy resilience on anyone, much less Vermonters? It has to be made clear that this is not about green energy, but rather about lowest cost energy with the best energy security and resilience that happens to be green and forward looking.” Lastly, Gill observed that conservatives are “at best transactional tactical thinkers. They are unable, or unwilling, to imagine how energy, education and broadband could work together to create something much greater than the sum of the parts. How do they want to get to the future? What sort of future do they want? Their go-slow approach only results in ever worse climate changes and consequences. What is their strategy for minimizing the risks of climate degradation? Or will they delay until there is no time left for effective action?” Those are excellent questions, and they are precisely the ones Vermonters should be asking Ross Connolly the next time he deigns to come to the Green Mountain State to advocate for the policies promoted by his paymasters.

    "full_text": "Industry experts note that the collaboration reinforces Kenya’s position as a hub for sustainable innovation, demonstrating how cross-sector partnerships can accelerate climate resilience and create new economic opportunities. The lack of access to clean cooking and sustainable transport is a big issue on the African continent. In an exciting development, two companies working to solve both these problems have just signed a partnership agreement. This development highlights the growing clean tech ecosystem on the African continent that is now ramping up, and in the process unlocking valuable inherent synergies. Kenya’s clean energy sector has received a major boost following a new partnership between electric mobility leader Spiro and clean fuel distributor KOKO Networks. The partnership will see more than 3,000 KOKO delivery agents adopt Spiro’s electric motorbikes, marking a major milestone in the clean energy and transport sectors. By tapping into Spiro’s e-mobility platform, KOKO will extend its sustainability strategy beyond kitchens into transport, reducing distribution costs while contributing to Kenya’s decarbonization agenda. KOKO Networks distributes bio-ethanol cooking fuel to households in Kenya and Rwanda. Spiro operates more than 35,000 electric motorbikes across Africa and runs the continent’s largest battery-swapping network, with over 20 million battery swaps completed. Spiro says the company’s expanding network of more than 800 swap stations ensures riders and enterprises can access reliable, zero-emission transport at scale. It’s 2025, and sadly, over 900 million people still do not have access to clean cooking. Yes, almost 1 billion people on the African continent lack access to clean cooking. Wood fuel, waste, and charcoal burned in three‐stone fires are still the dominant energy sources for cooking on the continent. The fuel is “free,” relatively easy to find, and the three‐stone fire offers not only a cooking platform but also provides heat in the colder months of the year. However, the smoke associated with cooking from open fires is dangerous. 4 million people die every year from illnesses associated with smoke from cooking. The Clean Cooking Alliance notes that women and children in developing countries are severely affected as they spend up to 20 hours a week gathering these wood fuels or similar for cooking. Accelerating the transmission to cleaner cooking has become critical and will allow women and children to free up time to take up more productive activities in the community. A lot of these people are in Africa and KOKO Networks is working to help address this major problem. KOKO says it is mainstreaming liquid bioethanol cooking fuel as a fast, safe, and affordable alternative to dirty cooking fuels such as charcoal. Their website says,“We partner with the downstream fuels industry to “drop in” this new fuel, and offer a suite of distribution, dispensing and end-use technologies that ensure customers can safely access clean fuel at prices that undercut dirty fuels. The solution to African deforestation starts in its cities, by switching households away from charcoal cooking fuel.” KOKO says it harnesses bioethanol, a renewable liquid fuel that is already produced at scale as a byproduct of sugar production in most tropical nations. KOKO adds that its ecosystem enables large fuel companies to easily source and handle bioethanol using facilities they already have for petrol, diesel, and kerosene, and then distribute the clean fuel to a network of KOKO bioethanol fuel dispensers (fuel ATMs). These smart fuel ATMs are placed inside thousands of small neighborhood shops by KOKO, enabling widespread fuel availability. KOKO’s distribution channel will now take advantage of the growing electric motorcycle taxi and delivery sector to unlock efficiencies in this network. Motorcycle taxis are a phenomenon on the African continent, which explains why the motorcycle taxi industry is attracting huge attention and investments. These motorcycle taxis are the heartbeat of the passenger and small goods transport system in a lot of countries in Africa. Close to 30 million motorcycles on the continent are used in this motorcycle taxi industry. With almost 99% of them still being internal combustion engine motorcycles, there is a huge opportunity and a large addressable market for electrification. The move towards electric vehicles in Africa, especially in this electric motorcycle sector, has mainly been driven by the private sector by small startup companies. A number of these motorcycle startups are now scaling at an incredible pace. Spiro is leading this charge with the highest number of motorcycles on the road, as well as battery swap and charging stations. Spiro and KOKO’s growth in their respective sectors have resulted in the development of inherent synergies leading to their paths to meet sooner rather than later. Another positive to add in there is that Kenya’s electricity generation mix is quite clean, with over 90% of electricity generated coming from renewables. That means as KOKO works to lower smoke due to cooking with open fires, and Spiro is working to lower tailpipe emissions in the motorcycle sector, the synergies between the two will have a compounding effect on emissions savings as the two firms continue to scale and unlock further synergies. By gradually increasing the penetration of electric motorcycles in Kenya, significant savings in CO2 emissions can be achieved through displacing petrol imports with locally generated renewables. This can be achieved by incentivizing purchases of new electric motorbikes. 2023 was the first time the Kenyan motorcycle sales market saw a noticeable increase in the share of electric motorcycles in the overall new registrations market. In 2023, there were 70,691 motorcycles sold in Kenya. 2,557 of these were electric. That means 3.6% of motorcycles sold in 2023 in Kenya were electric. That is almost 4%. So, we did not expect it to be long before the market share reached the critical 5%, which is generally viewed as the tipping point indicating the start of mass adoption. The share of electric motorcycles rose to 3.6% in 2023 from 2.8% in 2022 and 0.5% in 2021. 2024 was even better as the market share surged to 7.1%. The KNBS Economic Survey Report (2025) shows that 68,804 new motorcycles were registered in Kenya in 2024. Of these, 4,862 motorcycles were electric, according to data presented by the Electric Mobility Association of Kenya (EMAK). That is where the 7.1% market share comes from. B2B fleet sales and partnerships such as this one between Spiro and KOKO will help accelerate the transition to electric.

    "full_text": "After a series of other articles about the US electric vehicle (EV) market in the second quarter, here’s our last analysis and statistical breakdown for the quarter. This one concerns what percentage of different brands’ and auto groups’ total auto sales were EV sales last quarter. (Note that we’re only referring to 100% battery-electric vehicles here, not plugin hybrids.) Starting with brands, naturally, we do have six auto brands that are fully electric brands. I do like leaving these in here because: 1) it shows the final target and how far away from it different brands are, and 2) as more brands are formed or climb into this position, it’s fun seeing those bars grow in number. Looking past them, though, we see Fiat at a very high level (86.3), but Fiat is tiny. Next up is the first really notable result. Cadillac is leading the way with 26.6% of its sales coming from EVs! Not too shabby. How long until it gets to 30%? 50%? Acura is far below that, but it’s not doing to shabby at 14.7%, and Audi and Porsche are right behind it at 14.4% and 14.3%, respectively. But they are so far behind Cadillac now. Can they catch up? Wrapping up the brands with more than 10% of their sales coming from EVs, we’ve got BMW at 12.2%. Though, Volvo and Dodge are not far behind 10% at 9.2% and 9.1%, respectively.Dodge?!?!Wow, how did that happen?! As far as auto groups go, there’s nothing quite as spectacular, but BMW Group is now at 11.3% of its sales coming from EVs, and fellow German Volkswagen Group is in second place at 8.5%. Overall, though, the percentages are quite disappointing, and even third place GM is at only 6.0%. Disappointing? Yes. But this is the United States after all. How long will it take until we have three of these auto groups above 10% EV share, or at 50% EV share for that matter? Any guesses? Zach is tryin' to help society help itself one word at a time.

    "full_text": "Almost one hundred and forty-three years ago, on September 5, 1882, workers in New York City celebrated the first Labor Day holiday with a parade. The occasion becamean annual celebrationof the social and economic achievements of US workers and their contributions to the country’s strength, prosperity, and well-being. Workers marched this Labor Day, September 1, 2025, in opposition to the Trump administration’spoliciesthat have forced federal employees from their jobs, attempted to weaken collective bargaining, cut the minimum wage, eviscerated Medicaid, and removed legal immigrant workers. Nearly 1,000 “Worker over Billionaire” protests were held in all 50 states as part of a Labor Day week of action organized by labor unions and advocacy groups. The Enfield, Connecticut group numbered just about 100 persons but seemed to spur a robust response from motorists, large numbers of whom waved and honked as they drove by. These protests complemented a nationalpollconducted by theAFL-CIOand David Binder Research, which found trust in labor unions is at 55% – larger than the 36% of respondents who said they trusted the Democratic party and the 35% of respondents who said they trusted the Republican party. Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO,argued, “People are waking up to the fact we don’t have to just sit back and take it, and the labor movement is the place to go to channel that activism, to build what’s next, and we’re putting forward a vision for what the economy can be.” As of December 2024, private companies had announced more than$450 billionin new clean energy investments in almost every state in the US since President Joe Biden had taken office. These new investments helped create more than 400,000 good-paying clean energy jobs during Biden’s term. In contrast, Trump celebrated Labor Day this year by praising US workers but also enacting astop-work orderthat halted construction of a nearly-finished offshore wind farm, sidelining roughly 1,000 workers. The Administration has cancelled $679 million in funding for offshore wind projects. The Revolution Wind farm off the coast of Connecticut and Rhode Island was80% constructedand set to be completed in early 2026. Once online it could power more than 350,000 homes and enable Rhode Island to meet its goal of 100% renewable energy by 2033. Cancellation of this funding places Connecticut and Rhode Island jobs in jeopardy. Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO,saidhis members were caught off-guard by the administration’s move against the Revolution Wind project. “A lot of them voted for Trump, and they didn’t vote to have their jobs cut,” Crowley said. “That’s the level of anger right now.” The Board of Directors of the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticutexplainedthat the offshore Wind project is part of a $20 billion investment in “American energy generation, port infrastructure, supply chain, and domestic shipbuilding and manufacturing across over 40 states” by Ørsted, a Danish multinational company. “This move jeopardizes a critical source of clean, reliable energy for our region, along with the vital jobs, infrastructure investments, and energy cost savings it supports.” As if the halt to the Revolution Wind project wasn’t enough, the Department of Energy also announced it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee to complete infrastructure for an offshore wind project in New Jersey. Historian and social commentator Heather Cox Richardsonstatedthat the cancellations reflect Trump’s “apparent determination to kill off wind and solar power initiatives and to force the United States to depend on fossil fuels,” unlike former president Joe Biden, who made “investing in clean energy a central pillar of his administration.” Lou Antonellis, the business manager of the Massachusetts International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 103,addedthat the cuts to renewable energy projects in the US were not just cuts to projects. “You’re pulling paychecks from working families, you’re pulling apprentices out of training facilities, you’re pulling opportunity straight out of our communities. Every solar panel installed, every wind turbine wired, every EV charger connected, that’s a job with wages, healthcare, and a pension that stands for dignity for the American worker. You don’t kill that kind of progress: you build on it.” In 2023, clean energy investmentspoweredstrong overall growth ofjobs in the energy sector. Unionization rates in clean energy grew to their highest level yet, driven by large increases in union-dense construction and utility employment. Energy employers reported less difficulty in hiring qualified workers than in the previous year. US energy sector jobs grew 3% in 2023, outpacing solid overall US employment growth by 50%. Energy sector employment increased by over 250,000 from 8.10 million total energy jobs in 2022 to 8.35 million in 2023. The Trump policies to prop up the fossil fuel industry fail to take into account the strength and promise of the renewable energy sector. Meanwhile, as Trump pushesmisinformationabout renewables, electricity prices are steadily rising upward. Across the country, electricity priceshave jumpedmore than twice as fast as the overall cost of living in the last year. July’s fossil generation peak was the highest monthly total in nine years and yielded the largest US monthly power sector emissions toll since August 2021. The country’s largest grid, which stretches from Virginia to Illinois,dependson electricity that is derived from natural gas, coal, and nuclear reactors. The Energy Department says the cost of gas used to generate power jumped more than40%in the first half of this year compared to 2024. Another 17% increase is expected next year. Bappa SinhawritesinPeople’s Democracythat each energy administration carries “with it the underpinnings of an entire social order. Energy determines the productive forces, which in turn shape the relations of society. The type of power harnessed plays a significant role in shaping society.” Take the sun and wind. They’re free and abundant and free. After their infrastructure is in place, the ongoing cost of production plunges. “Where fossil fuels breed monopolies and imperial rivalries,” Sinha notes, “renewables open the possibility of decentralization, abundance, and long term planning.” It’s easy to forget how the electricity grid arose from the fossil and nuclear age. Its extensive networks moved electricity from enormouscentralized generation facilitieslocated away from end-users and connected to a network of high-voltage transmission lines. It allowed the US to become an electrified economy.

    "full_text": "Recently I sat down virtually with Laurent Segalen and Gerard Reid, investors, bon vivants, and hosts ofRedefining Energy, the main channel to my nerdcast side channelRedefining Energy—Tech. The reason? A fun episode of their podcast where we talked about sin, energy, and investment. Laurent Segalen [LS]:Today on Redefining Energy. This is a super special show for the end of the summer. Gerard. What are we going to talk about? Gerard Reid [GR]:We’re going to talk about the seven deadly sins of the energy world. [LS]: And in order to do so, we need to bring our blue flame thinker, our friend, colleague from Canada, Michael Barnard. Michael Barnard [MB]:Welcome, welcome. I’m so glad to be here, as always. [LS]:I don’t know who coined the term “seven sins.” It was Pope Gregory or someone in the sixth century. We decided—I don’t know exactly who, because we were exchanging ideas during the summer and it just popped up—to call it the seven sins of the energy transition. [GR]:It must have been me, because I’m the creative one. Just so you know, it must have been me. [LS]:That’s for sure. It was not me. [MB]:I certainly remember it being Gerard who was pushing for it. [GR]:It was somebody else that came up with the idea, but it was very good. [LS]:The seven sins are, Michael? [MB]:I’d just like to say that assertions I have personal and extensive experience with all of them are completely true. The list is greed, gluttony, sloth, pride, lust, wrath, anger, and envy. [LS]:Okay, I know you were educated in the seminar, but how does it translate for investment? [MB]:For investment, what we have to think about is that sins are the things we’re really subject to, which aren’t good for us or for others around us. In the energy world, as we consider the exemplars of sloth or greed, we have to say that if the analogy fits, then it’s going to hobble your investments. [LS]:So what are they, please? Number one, number two. Number three. [MB]:As we go through these: for greed, we have carbon capture and sequestration and direct air capture. Avarice and pipelines. For gluttony, nothing fits better than hydrogen—the calorie-bomb energy carrier. For sloth, it’s nuclear and small modular reactors. Then there’s pride: fusion, hubris with a torus. It’s very interesting research, but it has nothing to do with the energy transition or decarbonization. For lust, biofuels everywhere—the drop-in siren song. It’s a nice idea that we don’t have to replace the engines or the vehicles, but while we need biofuels for the really hard-to-decarbonize segments, we’re just going to electrify everything else. Then there’s wrath. This one leans into the United States right now, canceling offshore wind. It’s a reprise of rage against the turbines. And finally envy: the greenwashing cosplay of the past five years of ESG reporting. As somebody said, “I’ve got a guy in the sub-basement who fills in those forms for us.” [GR]:Well, why don’t we start with greed, which I’d describe as subsidy mining in a lab coat. You might call it carbon capture and direct air capture, but for me, it’s subsidy mining. [LS]:No, no, it’s regulatory capture, not carbon. Because they capture more subsidies than CO2. [MB]:I have to say, the entire Climeworks scandal—where they can’t actually get it to work and the expected targets are such a tiny amount—shows that they’re going to be capturing and sequestering less CO₂ than it costs to capture and sequester it. In terms of emissions, it’s just a dead end. While 420 parts per million is really problematic from a global warming perspective, it’s also an engineering problem. It’s like trying to strain a drop of urine out of an Olympic-sized swimming pool. You just have to accept that’s going to be hard. [GR]:Michael, what I’ll add to this—and I’d like to hear your thoughts on it—is that here we are during this podcast, and Germany is bringing in carbon capture regulations. [MB]:We will need some carbon capture. It will pencil out in some places—for example, where there’s an industrial source of fairly pure CO₂ at reasonable pressures that can be put into a sequestration site directly underneath. That’s probably going to be a cheap way to do it. If we think of electrified cement, or the Sublime process—the electrochemical process that produces a fairly pure stream of CO₂—located beside the ocean with a pipeline leading to offshore sequestration, that actually pencils out as fairly low-cost, low-carbon cement. But unless you have a sequestration site directly under the facility, or you’re on the seashore with a pipeline offshore, it just gets more and more expensive and less likely. [LS]:At the end of the day, it’s just cost—except when you do enhanced soil recovery, which has been going pretty well. Oxy is the big specialist in that. But otherwise, it’s basically asking the taxpayer to capture the carbon, and that’s pretty much it. [GR]: Well, I love that. But on that note, it brings us to the next one: gluttony. I just love it—three kilowatt hours to make one kilowatt hour. And I know you two guys love this topic. [LS]:It’s hydrogen. There’s a lot of technical conversation around it, and I’m not a technical guy—I’m a trader. What I do know, and I’ve checked on ChatGPT and elsewhere, is that $1 per kilo of hydrogen equals about $50 per barrel of oil in terms of energy content. You can say, no, it’s 48.9, but I round it to 50 because it’s easier. So you’ve got these guys saying, “Oh, that’s great, we’ve got hydrogen at $8 per kilo.” I say, okay, fine—$8 per kilo means you’re trying to sell a barrel of oil at $400 per barrel. The market price is 60. Just tell me who’s going to pay the $340 difference? It’s just too expensive, period. It is, once again, regulatory capture. [MB]:The nice thing about hydrogen is that while many people invested in its narrative, it was based on the false assumption that green hydrogen would be cheap. If hydrogen could be delivered at a dollar per kilogram, that would work. But in the 2010s, people asked, “How cheap does hydrogen have to be in order to be used?” and then invented a bunch of ways to make it seem like it could get there. They were invested in the idea of $1 per kilogram hydrogen. Instead of saying, “Well, we can’t get there, it’s never going to get there,” they kept pushing it. I did the math and figured it out back then. If they had done the same, they wouldn’t have spent the last five or ten years trying to make hydrogen into something it’s not—an energy carrier. [LS]:I’ve got some funny numbers. In Australia, two years ago they booked 5 gigawatts for electrolyzers—out of which they’ll get zero. Now those 5 gigawatts have been shifted to AI and data centers. They had projects in Australia, Gladstone, Fortescue. In Germany, ArcelorMittal canceled, E.ON canceled. In the US, BP and Exxon canceled their projects. Air Products canceled, and the CEO had to be fired. ThyssenKrupp, Nucera—projects abandoned. Repsol too. It goes on and on. Whatever money you throw at it, people just won’t do it. So for me, it’s dead. [MB]:We can see this with the major industrial players that were supposed to drive demand. Stellantis walked away from its hydrogen Sprinter vans and is now saying battery electric for the entire range. Airbus walked away from its hydrogen aviation efforts. What we’re seeing is that everyone trying to make hydrogen work as an energy carrier on the demand side is discovering it doesn’t. There are probably as many hydrogen bus fleets sitting idle as there are in use. Another case in point: Lower Saxony’s passenger train organization famously ignored the neighboring province’s assessment that hydrogen trains would cost three times as much as battery-plus-overhead hybrid systems. They bought 14 hydrogen trains from Alstom—only four are in operation now. Alstom can’t get new fuel cells from Cummins, which took over the hydrogen fuel cell manufacturer. [GR]:Great, guys. I want to talk about sloth, and it’s one of my favorite topics because it’s always on time and always on budget—and that, of course, is nuclear. So where do we start? I want to start with 2029. The first SMR is meant to be online. What do you think—will it actually be on in 2029? Or will it be 2039, or 2049? And will it be on budget or not? [MB]:Well, pick the project you’re referring to. Which one—the one in Ontario? [MB]:Yeah, the one in Ontario. SMRs are interesting. The premise of small modular reactors was that the problem with nuclear was big reactors—that’s why they went over budget. Instead, the idea was to build small modular reactors in factory-like settings and churn them out like Cracker Jack boxes. But it’s been funny to watch. SMRs were originally posited to be 20 to 70 megawatts in capacity. All of those have fallen by the wayside. Now a “small” modular reactor is 300 megawatts. And 300 megawatts isn’t particularly small. It’s a third the size of a typical gigawatt-scale reactor. At 300 megawatts, it’s still a multibillion-dollar construction project. It’s not something you manufacture and deliver. A big part of the SMR theory was Wright’s law: every time you double production of a manufactured object, costs go down. For more complex objects like fuel cells, it might be 10%; for solar panels and batteries, it’s about 20%. But with a 300-megawatt nuclear reactor, you’re just not going to build that many. It’s more of a custom engineering project, so you don’t get the economies of scale or the experience curve. Without the doublings, it loses out time and time again. [GR]:Still didn’t answer the question though. 2029—will they do it? It’s a Canadian project. Are you going to back your fellow countrymen? [MB]:It’s true. I’ve been to that site—Bruce Nuclear—and I will say it’s a wonderful jobs program for the 12,000 people there. But it’s not going to benefit Ontario’s electrical generation. If it’s up and running by 2035, I’ll be surprised. They haven’t started construction. [GR]:I love it. I love it. Laurent, give me a number. Give me a year. [LS]:They will put it out. I really wonder about the cost, because the all-in cost of new nuclear is already $200 per megawatt-hour, and those guys might be even more expensive—$300, $400. If somebody’s willing to pay five times the market price, that’s fine. What fascinates me is not Hitachi or Rolls-Royce—and by the way, those are mostly submarine designs that have been reshuffled—it’s all the startups: NuScale, Kairos, X-energy, Terrestrial, LeadCold, Oklo, Ultra Safe Nuclear. And then I see Breakthrough, OpenAI, Amazon throwing a lot of money at them. That’s fascinating. [MB]:The US venture capital industry has become a great way for people to get rich without delivering anything. If you can get funding, the Wall Street guys make money, the venture capitalists make money—maybe. It doesn’t seem to matter much. If you can get a big VC like Breakthrough to put $500 million into your fund, you can coast for years without delivering anything. [GR]:That leads us to pride. And the way I would describe pride is: we will bottle the sun, we will go back to the source of all energy. What’s that? [MB]:I agree with that premise. We are going to bottle the sun—we’re going to work off fusion energy—but we’re going to position it at a safe distance, about 93 million miles away. We’ll rely on its gravitational pull to keep us in the Goldilocks zone, where enough energy reaches us to warm us out of glaciation but not bake us like Mercury. We’re going to capture that fusion energy. I think that’s what we’ll do. But yes, we are going to depend on fusion energy. [LS]:If I look at the startups: Helion Energy, $500 million raise backed by Sam Altman; Commonwealth Fusion, $2 billion; General Fusion in Vancouver, $20 million; Tokamak Energy in Oxfordshire, $172 million; Zap Energy, $330 million; Renaissance Fusion; Microfusion; TAE Technologies, $1.2 billion. This is absolutely phenomenal. And then there’s the disgrace—the ITER project in France, which is what, 30 years late and 20 times over budget? [MB]:The budget is up to about $80 billion now. I looked into it a couple of years ago because its target for success—set for 2040—is to maintain fusion for five minutes with thermal net energy delivery. But thermal net energy delivery means that if you actually bolted a generation device onto it, the amount of energy required to run the process would be equivalent to the electricity you’d get back. So their target for sustained fusion is five minutes with no net electricity delivered. All these breakthroughs you hear about in fusion—when you look closely, nobody’s actually doing fusion yet. We’ve just reached the point where really hard, weird engineering problems are being exposed. We are so far from making it work. I always say there is a place for fusion energy—we’ll need it in spaceships past the orbit of Jupiter sometime in the next 200 years. I’m glad research departments are investigating it and that money is being spent, but it has nothing to do with the energy transition. [GR]:Well, that brings us to lust—and what we really want to talk about here are the drop-in fantasies for every engine: biofuels. So where do we start, guys? [LS]:All biofuels started about 25 years ago. First, you have two big ones: sugar-based ethanol, which is in Brazil and relatively cheap; and corn-based ethanol, which is an absolute disaster. Half of the corn acreage in the US goes into biofuels. Of course, this was designed at a time when the US was importing a lot of oil, peak oil fears were strong, and people thought oil would hit $300 a barrel. Big Agro was there, and corn-based ethanol became the “solution.” That created a constituency. Plus, as you know, the first round of the US election is in Iowa—and Iowa is big on biofuels. So the system fossilized itself. In Europe, I think at some point they said, okay, stop the blending. But even today it’s still designed for a barrel of oil at $150. Since oil is much cheaper, they have to force it into the system through blending mandates. [MB]:Michael, I’m actually a strong advocate of biofuels for SAF and maritime fuels—without going too deep into that subject. But I have to say, some of the first-generation biofuel stuff led to a lot of negative press that doesn’t hold up once we start looking at second- and third-generation biofuels. We’re now at a point where we can dual-crop. We can take the corn husks and stalks, feed them into biofuel processing, and get ethanol or methanol, while the corn itself goes into the food system. That turns agricultural waste into a valuable product. Similarly, we can put corn stalks through biodigesters and create biomethane for manufacturing methanol, long-duration energy storage, and other uses. I think the demonization of biofuels as agricultural food displacers doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. Europe is far too precious on the subject. It’s just calories—whether consumed by animals, humans, or motors. We need calories of some sort, and we need liquid fuels of some sort in the future. But imagining we’re going to run trains, trucks, or cars on them—that’s nonsense. All ground transportation will electrify directly with batteries. [GR]:So Michael, I certainly agree with you, and I’m not going to add anything to that—but I will. What I really want to talk about is wrath, and in particular the wrath of Mr. Trump. What’s he got to do with our space? It’s what we call the culture war at sea. [LS]:Offshore wind. We just had a series of bad news for Ørsted, the biggest European developer in the US. They took on 5 out of the 30 gigawatts of projects, and their cancellation in New Jersey cost them a lot. Now their Revolution project, which is 80% completed, has been stopped. They’re trying to raise money, but the dilution is going to be phenomenal. So I’m just going to say one thing: Equinørsted. [GR]:Very good, Laurent. Could happen, could happen. [MB]:I’m going to lean into something else—I’m going to blame golfers. A lot of the rage against wind turbines comes down to golfers being pissed off at missing a putt, or something about golfers. A lot of Trump’s anger about wind turbines comes from when he was building another golf course in Scotland. At the same time, far offshore, a wind farm was planned. Some golfers on the tee would see a turbine blade or two on the horizon. That turned into 14 years of Trump thinking wind turbines are the devil’s pitchforks and fighting them constantly. Trump doesn’t care if what he says is true. He cares if it lands like a wedge shot—communicating something for votes or gain at the moment. So when he attacks wind energy, he’s feeding the anti-wind ragtag band of zealots in the US, telling them what they want to hear. He’s also telling fossil fuel industry folks worried about displacement by renewables what they’d like to hear. Except the fossil fuel industry doesn’t want wind and solar to go away either. In many cases they’re invested in them. They need electricity to run their facilities, and they want cheap electricity—and wind and solar provide that. So Trump is irrational on the subject, but he’s feeding into the irrational in the United States. [GR]:There’s another view I’d like to talk about on offshore wind—the economics. If I look at the United States, I wonder: why do you even need it? North America already has so much low-cost electricity, whether from gas, wind, or solar. So why do it? That’s my thinking on that. And by the way, sorry if I sound like Trump as well, but offshore wind is the easiest fight to pick because all the players are foreign. So it’s a win for him in every way. [MB]:It’s not true though. GE Vernova has an offshore wind farm in operation. Second, you’re forgetting that the United States is finding it impossible to build transmission. They’ve got all that lovely wind in the prairies, but they can’t get it to the coastlines. It’s much easier to put a submarine HVDC cable from 30 kilometers offshore into New York than it is to run one from Iowa to New York. [GR]:And that’s a fair point. You could also say, well, let’s just put undersea cables along the East Coast and move electricity that way. But the US—you know as well as I do—it’s very difficult to get anything done because it’s all state-level policies. You’ve got state interests that aren’t aligned with neighboring states, and it’s just really complex. [MB]:After talking to Jigar Shah a couple of years ago, early in his role with the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, my takeaway was that the United States has devolved the ability to say “no” down to the county level—and often to the individual. Transmission is a victim of that. [LS]:If I compare it to the North Sea—where you have shallow waters, an existing oil supply chain, and an established energy region—people didn’t hesitate. In the US, as Gerard says, they’ve got so many options that any push becomes extremely political, and the moment politics shift, everything changes. I think the European developers who went from the North Sea didn’t grasp the difference in mindset. They assumed that because people spoke English, they thought the same way. But they didn’t. So offshore wind in the US—our heart is bleeding for Ørsted, but it’s lost for our generation. [GR]:Let’s move to the last one: envy. This is really my pet hate—ESG box-ticking. What we’ve seen in the last few years is companies chasing ratings and labels, telling the world they’re better than their competitors and peers. But is that real-world decarbonization? I don’t think so. Has it really improved the way businesses are governed? No. Has it really had a positive impact on society? Questionable. [MB]:My exemplar for this was when ExxonMobil scored high on ESG rankings and Tesla didn’t. There’s a lot to say about where Tesla and Musk have gone—labor practices weren’t great—but this is the leading driver of electrification of transportation in the world. Tesla created the industry as much as anything else. Tesla also does battery storage and solar at residential, commercial, and utility scale. By most standards, it’s a very virtuous company. So when it fails the ESG ranking, there’s probably something wrong with the ESG ranking. [LS]:Well, as you reminded us at the beginning, the guy who said that was the CEO of Glencore—you know, ESG, the guy ticking boxes in the sub-basement—yet it created such a bureaucracy. It’s absolutely insane, the bureaucracy ESG has created. Of course, the European Commission has piled on laws, and it’s totally out of control. But anyway, I’d say it should be EWP. We need electricians, welders, and plumbers—not ESG specialists. EWP: electricians, welders, and plumbers. [MB]:I will say that right now there are a lot of indicators that, now that we’re past the ESG bubble, real consideration for doing the right things is still proceeding—because ESG was well-intentioned. One example is that despite Trump being in office and saying “drill, baby, drill,” Wall Street has cut funding for fossil fuel investments by 25%. Many billions less are flowing into the fossil fuel industry from investors than a year ago. That’s a very good sign. I’d also say there’s a lot of green hushing going on. Many corporations are decarbonizing their operations, but it’s not being touted right now—it’s not the time to tout it. They know the needle will swing on this. They know they need to do it, and they know they’re at risk globally, regardless of what the US does.Big corporations have to operate around the world. If the US becomes a retrograde pool of polluted smoke and carbon dioxide emissions, that doesn’t mean much when they also have to operate in China, Indonesia, Australia, and Europe. [GR]:Michael, what I’d like to add—just putting my economist hat on—is: what is ESG? What was it about? The E is environmental and the S is societal. And there’s no doubt we have what are called externalities—economic life as we know it can have negative impacts on societies and the environment. So being able to measure that and show it to investors makes a lot of sense to me. What governments tend to do is tax—tax pollution, for example. That’s how we generally deal with it. But giving that visibility is very important. The G, though, is very interesting for me. You gave the example of Tesla and Exxon. Tesla scored badly on the G. Why? Because you could argue the corporate governance is not good, based on the way they’re rated. But I’d ask: why would you invest in a badly governed business in the first place? Governance is also about management and leadership. Why wouldn’t you make that a key task of a fund manager—investing in good businesses? Somehow the G got completely mixed up—not just governance, but diversity and a whole pile of other areas that aren’t actually about good governance and business leadership. I think the G is the piece disappearing. The E and the S—most people across the world will say, yes, we do have to address those. [LS]:Take care of the E and the S, yes. But the G has been totally trampled by Silicon Valley. Now there are the “god founders” with 10 votes per share, and they’ve had so much success over the past 15 years in terms of wealth creation that nobody cares about governance anymore—as long as the stock’s going up. [MB]:What I will say is that in the United States there was a shareholder-only governance model for a couple of decades—from the ’80s through the 2010s—and that is starting to shift. They’ve got B Corps and other types of corporations that allow fiduciary responsibility not just to shareholders but to multiple stakeholders, including employees and the societies they operate in. So we are seeing a broadening of that model, and shareholder-only rights in the US are fading. There’s a revolution happening, and the US is moving more toward what Europe is doing. I think that’s positive. [LS]:Okay, Gerard, can you summarize the seven sins of the energy transition before we wrap up? [GR]:I can indeed.

    "full_text": "Last Updated on:1st September 2025, 11:38 am Back in 2020, New York City presented the world with an idea for something called the Center for Climate Solutions, an ambitious brick-and-mortar research and community connections platform aimed at hyper-accelerating strategies for a sustainable future, locally and globally. Now President Donald Trump has returned to office with a powerful fossil fuel agenda in his pocket and willing enablers in Congress. Nevertheless, the Center for Climate Solutions is still on track, with the forthcoming New York Climate Exchange as its centerpiece. It seems that no-one and nothing are shielded from the long arm of the White House these days, with leading academic institutions among those in the crosshairs. However, the Center for Climate Solutions could escape the fate of other institutions if only on account of the construction timeline. The anchor tenant of the campus will be a new academic institution called the New York Climate Exchange, but they do not expect to be up and running until the fall of 2029, a good six months after President Trump leaves office — peacefully one hopes, this time. If all goes according to plan, the Center for Climate Solutions and the Climate Exchange will be housed in a new building on historic Governors Island in the New York Harbor. The former military installation totals 172 acres, of which 22 acres is controlled by the National Park Service under the National Monument network. The remaining 150 acres are owned by the City of New York and managed by the public-private organization Trust for Governors Island. Ama­zon, Con Edi­son, Don­ald A. Pels Char­i­ta­ble Trust, and New York Com­mu­ni­ty Trust are among the private sector partners supporting the Trust for Governors Island. In one sign that work continues apace, on September 1st, the top Swedish engineering firm Skanska announced that the Trust for Governors Island has contracted it to build a new substation on Governors Island at a cost of $67 million. Groundbreaking is expected before the end of the summer, with completion scheduled for 2027. That slots into the Climate Exchange timeline, which calls for groundbreaking next year in advance of the 2029 opening. “The Substation will serve several new tenant developments including a new public-school facility opening in September 2027, as well as the New York Climate Exchange, a planned 37,000 square meter research and education consortium dedicated to developing and implementingsolutions to the global climate crisisin New York City and beyond,” Skanska notes. The Climate Exchange did not just helicopter into Governors Island out of nowhere. The search for an anchor tenant began in 2020 and finally concluded with the selection of theNew York Climate Exchangeby the Center for Climate Solutions. The Climate Exchangewill function as a new branch of the sprawling State University of New York system as a project of Stony Brook University in collaboration with Oxford University and Brookhaven National Laboratory among other partners. IBM and Bloomberg Philanthropies also chipped in with a financial assist when the selection was announced. “The Exchange is a first-of-its-kind mod­el for devel­op­ing and imple­ment­ing solu­tions to the glob­al cli­mate cri­sis in New York and around the world,” the Trust for Governors Island explains. “The Exchange is a glob­al hub that lever­ages the col­lec­tive pow­er of edu­ca­tion, research, work­force devel­op­ment, pol­i­cy devel­op­ment, and pub­lic pro­gram­ming to advance cli­mate action at the local, nation­al, and glob­al level,” they add. The New York Climate Exchange is an ambitious endeavor, but it is just one project of the newly formedHar­bor Cli­mate Col­lab­o­ra­tive. The organization bills itself as “the cen­ter of a bur­geon­ing cli­mate inno­va­tion ecosys­tem in New York City.” It coordinates three powerful public-private economic engines, the Trust for Gov­er­nors Island, the New York City Eco­nom­ic Devel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion, and the Brook­lyn Navy Yard Devel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion. “The Collaborative is a key commitment of the Green Economy Action Plan, NYC’s roadmap to invest in the jobs and sectors that will help the city combat climate change, and train and position New Yorkers — particularly those from environmentally-disadvantaged communities — to benefit from the nearly 400,000 projected “green-collar” jobs in New York City by 2040,” NYC EDC explains. “As the core of New York City’sburgeoning climate innovation ecosystem, the Collaborative will invest over $725 million to advance New York’s green economy in NYCEDC’s Sunset Park District, the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and on Governors Island,” they add. If you caught that thing about 2040, that’s a good 10 years past January 20, 2029, when President Trump is scheduled to leave office, or at least that’s what he is supposed to do under the terms of the US Constitution. Regardless of what the President does or doesn’t do over the next 3-1/2 years or so, the climate crisis is not going anywhere, and neither are climate solutions. The march of technology has sustained itself throughout modern history regardless of any temporary shift in public policy. Just look at the US auto industry, where long term planning for an EV future is continuing apace, includingFordandGeneral Motorsas well as the new startupSlate Auto. Still, the Climate Exchange has been keeping itself under a low profile over the past few months. The President has plenty of room to do plenty of damage to climate planning in New York State, and New York Governor Kathy Hochul may be running out of cards to play. New York State narrowly dodged a bullet in April, when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum single-handedly broughtthe Empire Windproject to a screeching halt. Governor Hochul negotiated a restart, with the fate ofnew gas pipelinesin the state among the bargaining chips. Also on the table was a high-profile upgrade of Amtrak’s Pennsylvania Station in midtown Manhattan. New York taxpayers were originally on the hook for $1 billion in costs, but in April — during the dustup over Empire Wind — Hochul convinced Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy that the President should take all the credit for the makeover, shifting costs over to the shoulders of federal taxpayers everywhere. On August 27, Duffy announceda $43 million grant to Amtrak, aimed at fast-tracking the Penn Station. The move was enthusiastically endorsed by Hochul that same day. However, just two days later, on August 29th, Duffy announced thatNew York will lose $48 millionin Transportation Department funds that were supposed help upgrade the Arthur Kill Terminal on Staten Island for use as an offshore wind port. No word yet on reaction from Hochul’s office, or from Staten Island residents who were counting on new local employment opportunities at the port. Well, you get what you pay for. Voters on Staten Island gave the President a big thumbs-up of 64% last November.

    "full_text": "Last Updated on:1st September 2025, 11:33 am Who would like to purchase a brand new Chinese EV or PHEV online and have it delivered to their door? OK, anyone who lives in the US, put your hands down. Your government has decided you can’t have one. But for those who live in Europe, the service fromChina EV Marketplacemay be just what the doctor ordered. Not only does China EV Marketplace make it possible for European customers to purchase road legal electric cars and plug-in hybrids directly from China and have them delivered to their homes, the price can include clearing the cars through customs. Now it’s true that people can go to the port themselves to pick up their cars and deal with customs paperwork, but that extra bit of convenience is surely worth the modest amount the company charges for those services. China EV Marketplace claims to be the largest online shop for Chinese electric vehicles and serves customers worldwide. In the first half of the year, the company sold 7,000 vehicles, which was an increase of 66% compared to the first six months of 2024. However, according toCarNewsChina, this growth is mainly due to plug-in hybrids, as these are not subject to special tariffs when exported to the EU. The minimum order quantity at EV Marketplace is one vehicle, so it is open not only to commercial clients but to private customers as well. “For the first time, EV enthusiasts across Europe can order a new Chinese BEV or PHEV directly from China and have it delivered directly to their door,” explained Jakub Gersl, COO of China EV Marketplace. “Our new service removes the traditional complexities and headaches associated with international car imports.” Not only does the service apply to Chinese brands that already have an active presence in Europe, such as BYD, Xpeng, Nio, and Leapmotor, it also can import cars from companies that do not yet sell their products to the Continent. Xiaomi models in particular may appeal to Europeans, given their high performance and lower cost when compared to similar models from Tesla. In fact, China EV Marketplace will be only too happy to deliver a Tesla Model Y manufactured in Shanghai to a customer in Europe. Why would someone in Europe want to do that when the same model is being manufactured locally in Germany? The newly introduced6 passenger Model Y Lmay be a reason. Be the first on yourstrasseto own one and make all the other folks in yourNachbarschaftjealous! Volkswagen manufactures cars in China that are not available in the home market, like the ID.6X and ID.6 Crozz. These can now be imported to Europe for those who want something different. The Chinese made ID.3 is available through the online portal for about €24,000, including VAT — about €6000 less than a domestically-produced ID.3. So why isn’t everyone doing this? Because price is not the only factor when buying a new car. AsElectrivepoints out, these cars come without dealer support. Warranties? Fugeddabowdit. Parts? Nope. Service? Bring your car to the nearest dealer in Shenzen. If your car turns itself into a brick one fine morning, who you gonna call? Do you speak Cantonese? Since these vehicles are all built to Chinese specifications, they will be equipped with the Chinese GB/T charging standard, not the CCS2 connection commonly used in Europe. They need an adapter so that they can be charged at CCS2 charging points, which may affect charging performance. In addition, all controls will be labeled in Chinese and the vehicle’s operating system will be based on Chinese standards, which cannot easily be converted to other languages. Restrictions on use are also possible if the systems or apps can only communicate with Chinese servers. In addition to the prices quoted, China EV Marketplace charges $400 to clear each car through customs. Then each will need to be homologated to show it meets the local vehicle codes of the country in which it will be registered. Readers may recall that some Europeans have imported Tesla Cybertrucks to countries where safety standards are more relaxed but encountered problems when they tried to drive them in other nations where safety regulations are more rigorous. China EV Marketplace will take care of the homologation process for a fee — $1500 to $4000, depending on the model and country it is going to. In theory, customers can satisfy customs and homologation chores themselves, but that takes time and effort. When all is said and done, the extra fees and bureaucratic hassles may diminish the benefits of importing a car from China. However, the lure of having something no one else has is an intangible that you can’t put a price on. Lots of Americans are importingkeitrucksfrom Japan, where the diminutive vehicles are popular because they are cheap and fit on crowded streets. Thekeitrucks must be 25 years old before they can be legally imported to the US, and they arrive with no warranty and no parts or service network to support them, although such services are beginning to develop. People take a risk when they buy them, but they serve a market niche that domestic manufacturers choose to ignore. Speaking of trucks, China EV Marketplace will import a battery-electric Changan X2 mini box truck from Shenzen to your European country of choice at a cost of $8,090. This trucklet is perfect for inner city deliveries, but there is more to the story. Shipping can add $2,200 to $8,000 to the price, depending on destination. The customs clearance fee is $400 and the homologation fee is $3,000. The GB/T to CCS2 charging adapter is $990. Add it all up, and the low cost truck quickly more than doubles in price. Still, if it fits a particular purpose and there are no other electric vehicles that are suitable, it may be worth it. Then for those who prefer Jeep-like vehicles, there is the Baojun Yep, available in orange, green, or black for $11,200 plus tariffs, shipping, customs clearance, homologation, and charging adapter. TheBYD Seagull, sold as the Dolphin Surf in Europe, costs $10,200 plus tariffs, shipping, and all the other necessaries, but it sells in Europe for $22,900, so importing one can still save customers a significant amount of money. Will a BYD dealer in Europe service it? That’s a question you should ask before you put your money down. China EV Marketplace has been active in the United States, but will soon cease operations there. According to reports, sales figures have plummeted due to tariffs. So far, only around 30 vehicles have been sold in the US and those were to commercial customers for comparison purposes. Historically, vehicle importers have played an important role in the international auto business. For many years,Max Hoffmanwas the US importer for BMW automobiles, with a celebrated showroom in New York City.Brumos Porschein Jacksonville was instrumental in building the Porsche reputation for world class race cars. Luigi Chinetti was responsible for introducing the Ferrari marque to US customers, especially through his North American Racing Team (NART). Importing cars and trucks is big business. A little known Massachusetts auto dealer by the name of Ernie Boch made a deal to be the exclusive importer of Subarus east of the Mississippi, a move that made him a wealthy man. He used to have a yacht, the Empress Subaru, that sometimes visited Newport, RI. It was notable because it had a Subaru stowed on deck, where it could be lifted ashore via a special hoist. Those early Subarus were ugly little cars and many of Ernie Boch’s competitors thought he was crazy to get involved with an obscure Japanese automaker. Will Chine EV Marketplace become a part of automotive history? Check back in 20 years for the answer to that question.

    "full_text": "Last Updated on:1st September 2025, 11:23 am This article was curated together withCarbon Removal India Alliance (CRIA)— India’s only durable carbon removal (CDR)-focused industry coalition. India’s climate policy landscape is undergoing a pivotal transformation. Recent developments signal a shift from ambition to action, with foundational frameworks now taking shape across emissions management, carbon markets, international cooperation, and climate finance. The Government of India has issueddraft rulesunder the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), 2023, introducing mandatory Greenhouse Gas Emission Intensity (GEI) targets for five hard-to-abate sectors: Aluminum, Iron & Steel, Petroleum Refineries, Petrochemicals, and Textiles. Entities that outperform their targets can earn tradable carbon credits, while those that underperform must purchase credits or face penalties. This is a critical step toward operationalizing India’s carbon market and providing clarity to industry. The draft notification is open for public comments for 60 days from its publication. India and Japan are reportedly finalizing a Joint Credit Mechanism (JCM) under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, enabling Japanese firms to invest in and deploy carbon-reduction technologies in India to receive emission reduction credits. Target sectors includesolar energy, green hydrogen, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This partnership offers India a strategic opportunity to channel international finance into underdeveloped clean energy sectors (potentially including CDR) and leverage Japanese technical expertise. Read more on the India–Japan JCMhere. India’s Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance has released aDraft Climate FinanceTaxonomy, a landmark step toward aligning financial flows with climate goals. The taxonomy aims to guide investments into mitigation, adaptation, and transition activities. The Carbon Removal India Alliance (CRIA) and GDi Partners, with support from the Punjab Development Commission, Open Philanthropy, and the Nand & Jeet Khemka Foundation, co-organized a pivotal convening in April on “Biochar for Crop Residue Management & Climate Resilience” in Punjab. The event featured a Biochar Developers Showcase and panel discussions on policy, scaling, and finance, fostering connections and collaborative pathways for large scale biochar adoption in Punjab. Please find the key takeaways from the discussionhere. These policy shifts mark a directional progress for India’s climate strategy. By embedding emissions intensity targets, enabling international credit mechanisms, laying the groundwork for climate-aligned finance, and climate resilient agricultural supply chains, India is creating the enabling environment needed for CDR to scale responsibly and equitably. The Carbon Removal India Alliance (CRIA) remains committed to supporting this transition by fostering research, field validation, and pilot projects that advance the carbon removal ecosystem in India.

    "full_text": "Last Updated on:1st September 2025, 11:16 am Tesla dominates headlines. BYD gets the analysis articles. BMW and Mercedes fight for luxury coverage. Meanwhile, three Indian companies have been selling electric cars by the thousands, and most people outside India have never heard of them. The numbers are straightforward. They aren’t yet in the millions, like Tesla or BYD, but they are nevertheless significant in a market wanting to transition to EVs, mostly because of the lower cost of operations and quiet, smokeless performance. A survey by Park + Research Labs indicated that respondents who have bought EVs identified areas for improvement as accessible and safe public charging points, faster-charging batteries and reduction in EV prices. Tata Motors sold 3,825 electric vehicles in February 2025. Mahindra moved 2,632 units, up 343% from the previous year. In a country where every car purchase decision involves months of family discussions and calculator sessions, these companies have figured out how to make electric cars work. Tata’s electric lineup covers four strategic price points, each targeting distinct market segments. The Tiago EV costs ₹7.99 lakh ($9,100), positioning it against conventional petrol cars. The Punch EV runs ₹9.99 lakh ($11,400), targeting the compact SUV segment. The Nexon EV starts at ₹12.49 lakh ($14,200) and extends to ₹17.19 lakh across 10 variants. At the premium end, the newly launched Harrier EV hits ₹21.49 lakh ($24,500). These aren’t placeholder vehicles or compliance cars. The Nexon EV alone has sold over 50,000 units since its launch, becoming India’s best-selling electric SUV. Despite an 11% month-on-month decline in recent data, it maintains its position as the country’s most popular electric passenger vehicle. Taxi fleets in major cities like Mumbai and Delhi increasingly rely on Nexon EVs for their operations, with some fleet operators reporting 40% lower operating costs compared to conventional vehicles. The Tiago EV’s competitive positioning is remarkable globally — it’s priced within 15% of comparable petrol variants, a gap that shrinks further when government subsidies are applied. This pricing strategy has enabled Tata to capture families upgrading from entry-level petrol cars, a demographic most global EV manufacturers have struggled to reach. Tata maintains its market leadership through India’s most extensive EV service network, with over 500 charging stations across 180 cities and service centers in 300+ locations. When competitors face supply chain disruptions or struggle with after-sales support, Tata’s infrastructure advantage becomes decisive. The launch of the Harrier EV in June 2025 represents Tata’s most ambitious electric vehicle yet. Starting at ₹21.49 lakh and extending to ₹28.99 lakh for the AWD variant, the Harrier EV offers up to 627km range with dual battery options (65 kWh and 75 kWh). The AWD model delivers 390 bhp and 504 Nm torque, achieving 0-100 km/h in 6.3 seconds. This flagship model positions Tata to compete in the premium segment previously dominated by international brands. Mahindra launched two electric SUVs in late 2024 under the new “Mahindra Electric” sub-brand. The BE 6 costs ₹18.90 lakh ($21,500), while the XEV 9e is priced at ₹21.90 lakh ($25,000). Both vehicles represent a complete design philosophy shift, featuring futuristic styling and advanced infotainment systems that differentiate them from Mahindra’s conventional SUV lineup. In April 2025 alone, Mahindra’s new electric vehicles contributed significantly to overall market growth, with the segment growing 58% to over 12,000 units. The company sold 2,632 EVs with a remarkable 343% year-on-year growth, though this reflects expansion from a small base – Mahindra’s EV sales were minimal in 2023. The upcoming XUV 3XO EV will complete Mahindra’s electric portfolio at four models, targeting the sub-₹15 lakh segment where Tata currently dominates. Industry analysts predict this launch could capture 8-10% market share within its first year, based on Mahindra’s strong SUV brand equity. Bajaj Auto has emerged as India’s electric mobility leader in the two- and three-wheel segments. In 2024, Bajaj recorded best-ever electric scooter sales of 193,439 Chetak units, representing 169% year-on-year growth. This performance established Bajaj as a serious contender in India’s electric two-wheeler market, which reached 1.1 million units in 2024 with 29% annual growth. The Chetak’s success provided the foundation for broader electric ambitions. Bajaj became the first manufacturer to exceed 5,000 monthly electric three-wheeler sales in September 2024, achieving 8% market share in a segment that recorded 632,634 units with 57% annual growth in fiscal 2024. The February 2025 launch of the GoGo brand for electric three-wheelers targets India’s massive auto-rickshaw market. With models priced from ₹3.26 lakh to ₹3.83 lakh and offering up to 251km range, the GoGo lineup addresses commercial operators’ primary concerns about earnings potential and operational reliability. Bajaj’s approach differs from car manufacturers by focusing on practical urban mobility solutions rather than aspirational transportation. The company leverages existing dealer networks, brand equity, and manufacturing expertise to dominate segments where infrastructure constraints and price sensitivity matter more than advanced features. MG Motor India, the local subsidiary of Chinese SAIC, operates with a focused two-model strategy. The Windsor EV, priced between ₹12.00-14 lakh ($13,600-$16,000), became MG’s best-selling model with 4,308 units in July 2025 – representing 35% of the company’s total monthly sales. The Comet EV, at ₹7.50 lakh ($8,500), targets urban micro-mobility needs with its compact dimensions and city-focused 230km range. Together, the top three players — Tata, MG, and Mahindra — control over 90% of India’s electric passenger vehicle market, creating an oligopolistic structure unique among major automotive markets globally. This concentration reflects the challenges international brands face in adapting to Indian price points and infrastructure constraints. European luxury manufacturers operate in a separate ecosystem entirely. BMW leads the premium segment but with starting prices around ₹70 lakh ($80,000) — nearly four times the cost of mass-market electric SUVs. Mercedes-Benz and Audi combined sell fewer EVs monthly than MG alone, with their vehicles treated as luxury statements rather than transportation solutions. Korean manufacturers Hyundai and Kia occupy the crucial middle segment. Hyundai’s Kona Electric, despite limited volumes, established credibility for Korean EV technology. The upcoming Creta EV and Carens EV launches in 2025 will test whether Korean brands can achieve the price-feature balance needed for mass-market success. Early indications suggest pricing around ₹15-18 lakh, putting them in direct competition with Mahindra’s new offerings. Japanese automotive giants Toyota and Maruti Suzuki represent the most significant market validation. When companies known for reliable, affordable transportation commit to electric vehicles, it signals genuine market maturity. Maruti’s e Vitara and Toyota’s first Indian EV are expected to launch with aggressive pricing strategies, potentially disrupting the current three-player dominance. Chinese influence extends beyond MG through multiple channels. BYD maintains consistent presence in monthly sales rankings, though at smaller volumes. Leapmotor has confirmed the C10 SUV and T03 hatchback for Indian launch, while Vietnamese company VinFast progresses with VF6 and VF7 development, targeting the premium mass-market segment between Indian and European pricing.

    "full_text": "Oh the irony, it burns. The President of the United States of America aimed to kill the vehicle electrification movement in its cradle, but lately he’s been the one ruminating about heaven while US automakers keep laying more plans to populate the roads of the US with more EVs. Along with recent announcements from Ford and General Motors, Hyundai Motor Group is also making moves. To be clear, the near term outlook is less rosy than it was last year, when supportive federal policies encouraged both automakers and the auto-buying public to choose electric. Nevertheless, in August,FordandGeneral Motorsboth announced ambitious new EV plans with a focus on speed and affordability. Hyundai beat both automakers to the punch. In 2024, Hyundai opened its massivenew Metaplantin Georgia, then followed up in March of this year with a new investment plan of $21 billion over the next three years, covering a wide field of its US operations. The plan includes the goal of manufacturing a total of 1.2 million units of both ICE and electric vehicles combined, but Hyundai also took the opportunity to sketch out several EV-specific elements in the new three-year plan, includingrobotaxiand autonomous driving partnerships with Waymo and Aptiva, along with a continued interest in the newIONNAEV charging consortium. Hyundai also announced plans to establish a new “auto cluster” focusing on localized supply chains for battery packs among other auto parts. The $21 billion plan also supports other Hyundai ventures in the US, including robotics, SMR (Small Modular Reactor) nuclear energy, and eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft. So much for March. Much water has passed under the bridge in the months since then, including the passage of a new federal tax bill that eliminates the $7,500 credit for EVs, a cut for which Trump forcefully advocated and Republican members of Congress gleefully enacted. Nevertheless, at the beginning of August, Hyundai announced plans to bringmore electric delivery vansto the US, in partnership with the BrightDrop branch of General Motors. Hyundai capped off a busy month on August 25, when it announced a significant new addition of $5 billion more to the $21 billion announced in March, for a total of$26 billion invested in the USover the next three years. Hyundai did not add a new item to its to-do list, though it did emphasize that Hyundai Motor Company and Kia Corporation will “substantially expand” production capacity in the US, with the aim of “strengthening the Group’s ability to meet the evolving needs of American consumers with greater speed and efficiency.” What might Hyundai mean by “evolving needs” remains to be seen. One thing that comes to mind is the thirst of the US driving public forbig, bigger, and biggestvehicles of any sort, electric or not. However, that trend has been in motion for decades. It doesn’t represent a particularly new or different evolution in “the needs of American consumers.” What is evolving is the role of vehicles in homes and businesses. In contrast to the one-way fueling street that ties the hands of ICE vehicle owners, electric vehicles tap into a web of driver-centered interactions with smart grids, energy storage, solar panels, virtual power plants, and other 21st century technologies. If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Before you do, consider that Hyundai is among those already meeting those evolving needs. In 2022, the company launcheda home electrification packageincluding solar panels and energy storage in support of its zero-emission mobility business. In a sign that supply chain stakeholders are also looking ahead to the future, on August 27, the top-rated German firm MAHLE announced that it will begin manufacturing its e-compressors in Morristown, Tennessee. The new assembly line will share space with the company’s existing ICE piston manufacturing facility. “E-compressors are important for thethermal management in electric vehiclesand crucial for battery life, high charging speed and driving range,” MAHLE notes. “Starting the e-compressor production in Morristown, Tennessee, marks an important milestone for MAHLE as we further strengthen our footprint in the USA,” explained MAHL board chairman and CEO Arnd Franz. “This decision represents MAHLE’s strong commitment to the US market as well as for the Morristown production site,” Franz added. “MAHLE plans to increase its presence and activities in the USA in the coming years as part of the group’s strategy to manufacture world class products for vehicles ‘Made in America,'” MAHLE emphasized for good measure. Stakeholders in the EV charging industry also did not get the memo about the death of the electric car. News in that sector has been surfacing all year, including a new turnkeycharging station infrastructurepartnership between Eaton and ChargePoint. The plan was announced in May, and passage of the new tax law in July did not take the bloom off the rose. The two firms unveiled theirnew “ChargePoint Express Grid”in August. Another interesting item popped up on August 28, when Ford announced a new plan to install “Ford Charge” public and fleet EV charging stations at more than320 dealershipsacross the country. “Ford Charge has immense potential because it offers drivers the peace of mind of being backed by Ford,” enthused a dealer in New Hampshire in the company’s “On the Road” blog. The 320+ dealers are now part of Ford’s BlueOval Charge network, through which Ford aims to make EV fast chargers available within every 18 miles on main routes. Another area to keep an eye on is the growing field of transportable,drop-in charging stations. The mobile business model is designed for fleet decarbonization, providing a quick solution for near-term EV charging needs.

I’m hearing I’m not doing well,”the President said on August 19during a call-in to a television show. “I am really at the bottom of the totem pole.

    "full_text": "Last Updated on:1st September 2025, 11:04 am The January 2024 blackouts that plunged the Visayas into darkness exposed a harsh reality: the Philippines’ economic growth is outpacing its energy infrastructure. When aging coal plants failed and transmission lines couldn’t cope, Panay, Guimaras, and Negros lost power for days. For Iloilo Province, the crisis became a catalyst for transformation. Today, Iloilo sits atop over 1,390 megawatts of offshore wind service contracts — nearly five times its current generating capacity of 314 MW. This isn’t just energy diversification; it’s a complete reimagining of provincial power supply that could serve as a template for the Philippines’ renewable energy future. Iloilo’s offshore wind pipeline takes on new significance against the World Bank’s assessment of Philippine wind resources. The Bank estimates over 178 GW of technical offshore wind potential nationwide — enough to power Southeast Asia multiple times over. Within this vast resource, Iloilo’s 1,390 MW represents less than 1% of what’s technically feasible, suggesting the province is merely beginning to tap its wind wealth. The numbers tell a story of necessity driving ambition. East Panay and Sicogon account for 990 MW of planned capacity, with another 200 MW across Concepcion and the Iloilo Strait. Additional onshore and offshore projects totaling 350 MW remain in pre-development. If realized, this renewable capacity could transform Iloilo from energy-vulnerable to energy-abundant, potentially positioning the province as a net exporter to the broader Visayas grid. Pope John Sotto of the Global Wind Energy Council notes that Iloilo’s offshore wind resources alone could contribute up to 35% of the Philippines’ national electricity demand if fully developed. For a country importing over 90% of its fossil fuel requirements, such indigenous energy resources offer unprecedented strategic value. Iloilo’s renewable push arrives as the Philippines commits to achieving 50% renewable energy in its power mix by 2040. The World Bank’s comprehensive roadmap study identifies offshore wind as crucial for meeting this target, presenting scenarios that depend heavily on early-mover provinces demonstrating successful large-scale deployment. What distinguishes Iloilo’s approach is institutional commitment beyond project approvals. The Iloilo Provincial Ordinance on Renewable Energy (I-PORE) allocates provincial budget specifically for renewable projects, while dedicated energy offices and comprehensive planning align local priorities with national energy transition goals. Rey Victor Garin, the province’s energy efficiency focal person, describes systematic facilitation that extends from policy to implementation. Yet challenges persist. The Energy Virtual One-Stop Shop (EVOSS) platform designed to streamline permitting sees limited adoption — only Iloilo City has enrolled across the province. Complex regulatory processes and grid infrastructure constraints continue slowing development nationwide, highlighting the gap between renewable energy ambitions and implementation capacity. Perhaps most significantly, Iloilo’s energy transformation demonstrates how renewable development can benefit host communities directly. Energy Regulations No. 1-94 ensures that local areas receive financial benefits from power sales, supporting everything from electrification to healthcare improvements. The provincial government already uses energy savings from net-metered renewable installations to enhance hospital services. Gaspar Escobar Jr. of the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities emphasizes that offshore wind development creates economic multiplier effects beyond direct energy sales. Large-scale projects generate demand for steel, cement, and allied industries while creating employment from high-skilled engineering to local service positions. For provinces transitioning from agricultural to service-based economies, renewable energy represents another economic pillar. Converting 1,390 MW of offshore wind contracts into operational turbines remains the critical challenge. Grid integration poses particular difficulties in an archipelagic geography where existing infrastructure was designed around centralized fossil fuel plants rather than distributed renewable resources. Accommodating variable wind generation requires significant upgrades to transmission lines, substations, and grid management systems. The timeline matters critically. Iloilo’s continued economic growth drives power demand upward even as renewable projects advance through development phases. Success requires ensuring grid stability during the transition period while managing complex permitting processes and community relations. Yet the convergence of crisis and opportunity may provide necessary political momentum. The January 2024 blackouts created public awareness of energy vulnerability that climate arguments alone had failed to generate. Economic competitiveness concerns give business communities direct stakes in transition success, while provincial leadership provides local institutional capacity often missing from top-down energy planning. What happens in Iloilo over the next decade will influence energy policy across the Philippines. The World Bank’s development scenarios depend on successful early adopters proving that large-scale offshore wind is viable in Philippine conditions. Success would validate the Bank’s projections and demonstrate that the country’s 178 GW offshore wind potential is achievable. Failure would reinforce skepticism about renewable energy reliability in tropical archipelagic conditions, potentially derailing development scenarios that international institutions consider essential for Philippine energy security. Other provinces facing similar challenges would lose a proven model for harnessing their offshore wind resources. For now, Iloilo occupies an unusual position: a province that experienced energy crisis early enough to catalyze transformation before vulnerability became catastrophe. Whether January 2024’s blackouts mark the end of unsustainable energy dependence or the beginning of renewable abundance will determine not just Iloilo’s future, but potentially the trajectory of Philippine energy development itself. The offshore winds sweeping across Panay carry more than weather — they carry the potential to reshape how the Philippines powers its growth.

    "full_text": "It was recently announced that Dragonfly Energy’s Battle Born Batteries® are now the lithium battery option for all Airstream products. This is a really interesting development because batteries in motorized and towable recreational vehicles provide electricity for running onboard lights and appliances without needing to be constantly plugged into grid electricity. Having the ability to go off-grid for a time is exactly what some RVers want. There are also RV owners who want to utilize solar panels to generate their own electricity to charge their onboard battery systems. Additionally, there are some customers who live in their RVs so they have a tiny home on wheels. Batteries power their refrigerator and freezer combos, cookstop stoves, lights, AC/heat, laptops, wifi, and so on. When combined with their own solar power systems, they can charge their batteries and not have to use electricity from a utility. Tyler Bourns, Chief Marketing Officer at Dragonfly Energy, answered some questions about their expanded partnership with Airstream. Which Airstream products will have Dragonfly Energy’s Battle Born Batteries? Dragonfly Energy’s Battle Born® LiFePO₄ batteries have powered Airstream products for many years, and we’re proud to now be featured across their entire lineup. Beginning with the 2026 model year, our batteries are standard in Airstream’s Interstate and Atlas motorized lines, seamlessly integrated into both the Advanced Power System and the Advanced Power Plus Packages. Beyond that, Battle Born Batteries are available across all Airstream products, whether as standard equipment or as an optional upgrade. Our batteries use lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO₄), which is widely recognized as the safest chemistry for energy storage. Unlike other lithium chemistries, LiFePO₄ is highly stable, nontoxic, and far less prone to thermal runaway, making it ideal for mobile and residential applications. We take safety one step further by engineering our packs with cylindrical cells, which are inherently more robust and resistant to mechanical stress. That design choice not only improves reliability but also gives our customers confidence that their families are safe, even when they’re literally sleeping right on top of the batteries in an RV or trailer. All of our batteries are assembled in our 400,000-square-foot facility in Reno, Nevada, where we combine advanced engineering with rigorous quality control to ensure consistency and safety at scale. From a performance standpoint, our LiFePO₄ batteries deliver 3,000–5,000 cycles at 100% depth of discharge, meaning they last significantly longer than traditional lead-acid options while providing more than twice the usable power in the same footprint. Every Battle Born Battery is backed by a 10-year warranty; we build them to last, and we stand behind them. What are the battery capacities? We currently offer batteries ranging from 75 Ah up to 270 Ah, serving applications in the 12-volt to 48-volt range. Many of our models are available with optional integrated heating technology, ensuring reliable performance even in colder climates. In Airstream’s lineup specifically, our Battle Born Batteries are factory-installed within the Advanced Power System and Advanced Power Plus Packages on the Interstate and Atlas motorized products. At the heart of these packages is the High-Capacity System, featuring three of our patented BBGC3H LiFePO₄ batteries, which deliver 10.3 kWh of usable energy at 100% depth of discharge. For those who need even more power, Airstream Interstate and Atlas 2026 models can be upgraded to the Advanced Power Plus system, allowing customers to add up to two additional BBGC3 batteries (an extra 6.9 kWh) either at the factory or through an authorized Airstream dealer. Other Airstream towable units feature ourBBGC3HandBBGC2Hproducts, giving customers dependable lithium power options across the brand. These integrations provide long service life, safety, and confidence wherever Airstream owners’ travel. Do the batteries have thermal management, including for cold weather? Yes. All of our models are available with optional integrated heating technology inside, which provides internal thermal heating to allow for safe charging and discharging even in cold weather. Every Battle Born Battery also includes an advanced Battery Management System (BMS) with low-temperature protection, which prevents charging in conditions that are too cold, ensuring the cells are never damaged. Together, these safeguards deliver safe, reliable power year-round and give customers confidence in their systems no matter the climate. What is the price range for the batteries? Our batteries start at $799 for our most popular model, theBB10012(100 Ah 12V Deep Cycle), and go up to $2,299 for our largest battery, theBBGC3(270 Ah 12V Deep Cycle). Customers can also choose additional options, such as integrated heating or Dragonfly IntelLigence® wireless communication, for an added cost. Are the batteries compatible with solar power or a small wind turbine? Yes. Our Battle Born Batteries are a perfect match for solar power systems, and we firmly believe a battery bank should be considered a required part of any solar installation, so you can store the energy you capture and use it when you need it most. Our batteries also pair with small wind turbines, and while some of our off-grid customers experiment with them, wind generation is less common due to the relatively low energy produced compared to the turbine size. In both cases, our LiFePO₄ batteries provide safe, reliable storage that makes renewable energy truly usable. About how much do the batteries weigh? Our batteries are significantly lighter than traditional lead-acid — nearly one-third the weight in the same form factor. Depending on the model, our packs range from about 31 pounds for a 100 Ah battery up to around 80 pounds for our largest 270 Ah battery.

    "full_text": "Last Updated on:1st September 2025, 01:53 am Continuing our series onUS auto salesandUS EV salesin the second quarter of 2025, we now get to a short post but a big one. The whole idea of “cleantech” is technology that will help cut pollution, especially CO2 emissions, but also air pollution that is extremely harmful to human health. So, big figures with regard to EV (electric vehicle) sales are 1) what share of overall auto sales are EV sales, and 2) getting more to the point, how many fossil-fueled vehicles are put onto the market — leading to pollution for many years to come. EV share of the overall US auto market dropped to 7.4% in the second quarter, down year over year from 8.1% in Q2 2024, and also down quarter over quarter from 7.6% in Q1 2025. That’s not good…. 7.4% EV market share is the worst its been since Q1 2024 when the share was 7.2%. The EV market will surely rebound in Q3 2025 as people rush to buy electric vehicles before the US EV tax credit expires, but then it will no doubt crash in Q4. Looking at trends across the overall US fossil-fueled vehicle market, we can see that sales are up year over year (3% higher), up compared to two years ago (also by 3%), and up a great deal compared to Q2 2022 (+14%). They are down considerably (-14%) compared to Q2 2021. Though, admittedly, 2021 was an odd year for the auto industry. There was a surge in sales back then as markets rebounded from COVID-19 lockdowns and supply chain challenges. Overall, growing fossil fuel vehicle sales and declining EV sales are not positive trends for the US auto market, but hopefully they are just a blip and we will get back on track soon.

    "full_text": "My travels in my non-Tesla electric vehicle (EV)had been fraughtover the last few summers. There were too many times where sporadic or Level 2 charging, which provides about25 milesof range per hour, had made my longer distance travel quite time-consuming. In 2025, though, in addition to a significantbuildoutof charging stations, the North American Charging Standard (NACS), developed by Tesla, became available. NACS needs an adapter for all but2000 non-Teslas, and only newer generation Superchargers can accommodate the NACS. I learned that lesson earlier in the summer: non-Tesla EVscan only chargeat the V3 250kW or V4 chargers. Would the NACS make a difference in charger availability and faster charging while my guy and I were on the road? It was time to find out. During the summer my family and I garage our Model Y and move from Florida to Connecticut. We explore the region from our park model home with our 2017 Chevy Bolt. It has an upgraded battery and anticipated range of about265 miles. These summer digs have just 30 amp electrical service, so adding a 40 amp, 240 volt circuit has been out of the question. Hubby installed a weather resistant outlet to the exterior of our shed, and we’ve been plugging into that household outlet for the majority of times we’ve spent in our summer bungalow by the brook and state forest. Like many EV drivers, our pattern is toplug inwhen we get home and wake up to a fully charged battery. That scenario disintegrates into dust, however, if we’re going to be taking a road trip. Last month it was toCape Cod. This month it was 11 days in northern New England, with the first leg starting off in north-central Connecticut and moving through Massachusetts and New Hampshire and into Maine. There we’d spend three nights with friends, enjoying their north country summer spaces before heading to a week in Vermont. Tesla’s fabulous Supercharger system used to be available only to Teslas, but with our newly purchasedNACS adaptertucked cozily into its own corner of the hatchback, we were ready to hit the road, head to the northern country, and test our luck. Would our slow tripping be more efficient this summer season? I created aspreadsheetof fast charging options, just to increase our odds of success. We pulled into Seabrook, New Hampshire and The Brook casino compound. After wandering around just a bit, we found the Tesla Superchargers bank. It’s open to Tesla and NACS-enabled vehicles with CCS compatibility. Getting the charger to recognize our existing Tesla account was, admittedly, a bit of an ordeal. The screen variously wanted us to enter in a serial number on the side of the charger or to scan a QR code. We had to move the Bolt twice to a new space because previous failed attempts indicated to the Tesla reader that the spot was occupied. But number three was golden — voila! It recognized my scan of the QR code and the final click in place of the balky connector with attached NACS adapter. While the Bolt charged, we entered the casino through swooping electric doors and into a vast room full of slot machines. At noon, several bars were open. The patrons were pasty, wearing ill-fitting clothes, and squinting in the dim light. After a quick restroom stop we ventured back outside and sat in the comfort of our Bolt. In 21 minutes we gained 10 kWh of energy for $5.22. At 80%, it would be enough to get us to our Kennebunkport, Maine destination. The Goose Rocks area of Kennebunkport runs parallel to the Gulf of Maine and its striking tidal rise and fall of up to 15 feet. Our host was a friend from Florida who invited us to her home. Her large family greeted us warmly, and we spent the evening telling stories and breaking bread. The Bolt happily sucked up electrons from an outlet in the barn. The Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge was out back — grasses swaying in the current, seagulls squawking, light glinting off the stream. We added 60 anticipated miles overnight. From there we headed north to Augusta, Maine and another Tesla Supercharger equipped to accept our NACS adapter. This time the screen identified me immediately — no need to register through a QR code. As we were setting up to charge, a Tesla technician approached us. He was repairing one of the 16 Superchargers and let us know that this site did not require our NACS adapter — it had an internal adapter. It was a Magic Dock. This connector was slim and elegant — a world away from the usual clunky NACS fit and much easier to plug in. We ate a bland snack at a 99 Restaurant in the same parking lot. Over 51 minutes we added 26.6 kWh at $.53/kWh, for a total of $14.12. We hopped in the car, with only 30 minutes until our next destination. In the Sheepscot Lake region of Palermo, Maine, we were delighted to plug into an exterior outlet at our friend’s rustic rental cottage, which had upgraded electrical. We sat on the dock and watched diving ducks. Looking out a wall of windows to a lake cove, we feasted on pasta primavera one night and stir fry the next. We toured around the arts-oriented seaport of Belfast, savoring a vegetarian lunch and a walk along the waterfront. The Bolt purred away as it inhaled electrons. Before we knew it we were waving goodbye and off to North Conway, New Hampshire, where we would meet aCleanTechnicareader for lunch. A bank of 8 Tesla Superchargers awaited us. We noted the stall number, pressed that icon on the Tesla app, and plugged in. While the NACS adapter continued to be balky, it did click in with a little extraooommmpphh. We ate at a nearby “Mexican” restaurant (too Americanized for my tastes), chatted with our new friend, and accumulated 23.09 kWh in 1 hour and 7 minutes — up to 92% charge! I took a turn removing the connector and separating the NACS adapter from it; it wasn’t a graceful sight, with me bracing the connector between my legs and pulling the adapter off with all my might. But I did it, which gave me the confidence to know that I could use the NACS successfully by myself if my guy were not with me. My brother’sWaitsfield, Vermont home, set on the side of a mountain and looking out over the valley to the Mad River Ski area, was our final destination of the trip. It took nearly another three hours of travel to reach this northern New England oasis, where we immediately plugged into an exterior plug. Here we relaxed with friends and spent a week savoring the vistas, breathing in the802 fun. Our charging for the rest of the trip was at non-Supercharger sites, but having the NACS fast charging capability across the previous miles made all the difference in our peace of mind. Yes, we relied on the kindness of friends and their exterior household plugs, sure. But we were able to successfully traverse the region on lots of highways from ocean to lake to mountains and valleys, with about one hour stops each time to charge. It was slow tripping without range anxiety — a much-improved, elevated EV road trip experience. I would do it again!

    "full_text": "In their book,Abundance, Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein argue that the progressive policies so carefully put in place by progressive politicians over the past several decades — things like the Administrative Procedures Act and the National Environmental Policy Act — have fueled the furious assault on reason and rationality on display every hour of every day by the MAGA crowd — especially the full frontal assault on renewable energy. They write that progressives over the past 30 years have been more concerned with erecting barriers to right-wing policy initiatives than actually getting things done. The result of all those restrictions is the perception that government doesn’t work. It is that constant drumbeat of “government is the problem” thinking that has brought the New Fascism to prominence in the US, they suggest. In other words, the road to hell is paved with good intentions and Democrats have pretty much shot themselves in the foot with their insistence on requiring all government action be fully compliant with every jot and tittle of the progressive agenda. In a recent article byRebecca Egan forGrist, she suggests many of those environmental protection efforts created by progressives are now being turned into weapons against environmental action by the fossil fuel industry and its acolytes. The evidence can be seen in a statement by the failed president of the United States that he posted on his personal antisocial media channel recently in which he said the administration “will not approve wind or farmer destroying Solar. The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!” Actually, the days of stupidity are just beginning, as he and his slavish minions are taking a sledgehammer to renewable energy at every opportunity. Egan says many renewable energy experts say what the president and the Interior Department are doing is using the environmental legal playbook created by progressives against them to derail renewable energy. Laws meant to protect and safeguard wildlife and public lands from mining, drilling, and habitat degradation — such as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act’s prohibition against “unnecessary or undue degradation” — are being used as a cudgel against wind and solar, Egan writes. “They are effectively trying to co-opt arguments that we have used for years to push back on fossil fuels,” Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, the executive director at the Western Environmental Law Center, told Egan. “But I think it should go without saying that they are abusing those laws.” Thompson and Klein would agree with that analysis. He pointed to the recent capacity density order by the Interior Department as a particularly troubling example. Secretarial orders are meant to function as internal guidance to agencies. “They are not intended to put in place substantive rules that dictate outcomes,” he said, calling the capacity density order “ade factoprohibition against the siting and permitting of renewables on federal public lands. The DOI is fixating on this one metric — capacity density — to the exclusion of a holistic understanding of costs and benefits of a particular energy technology.” What is capacity density? In simple terms, it is a measure of how much energy can be created per square foot, or square yard, or acre of land. A tank of gasoline has a greater energy content than a 65 kWh battery. By the DOI’s logic, electric cars would be banned on public roads unless and until their batteries reach energy density with gasoline on a per volume basis. As Egan points out, when a wind or solar farm is decommissioned, the equipment is removed and within a year or two, it’s hard to tell anything was there and the land can be reused. But when a refinery or a fossil fuel plant shuts down, the ground is poisoned. Cancer-causing chemicals like benzene saturate the soil and remediation can take years, assuming it happens at all. “The DOI is fixating on this one metric, capacity density, to the exclusion of a holistic understanding of costs and benefits of a particular energy technology,” said Schlenker-Goodrich. “The [DOI is] trying to come up with the facade of a rational reason to stop doing anything related to renewables, but this one especially is really mind-boggling,” said Josh Axelrod, senior policy advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Everything it compares wind and solar to — none of those types of facilities are built on federal land. … There’s no comparison.” The Interior Department’s order that all wind and solar projects on federal land undergo “elevated review” is another misuse of environmental law, experts toldGrist.Routine procedures that would have previously been handled by a DOI bureaucrat will now need the secretary’s personal sign-off. The restrictions will impact projects on private land just as much as on public land. A recentanalysis from The American Clean Power Associationfound that 27 of the new procedures requiring Burgum’s sign-off — such as needing consultations around harm to wildlife and endangered species — will allow the DOI to effectively end development of renewable energy projects nationwide. The goal, it seems, is to create an impossible backlog that bleeds projects of funding before they can get off the ground, Egan writes, and the rules and regulations created by environmentalists are making such attacks on common sense possible. It’s a variation on the old expression “Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.” And boy, howdy, are Democrats getting it! Alex Klass, an environmental law professor at the University of Michigan, told Egan, “[The administration] can talk about energy dominance and talk about the need for new energy,” she said, “but before there was always an argument [that] you shouldn’t try to prop up an industry that can’t make it on its own. That’s basically what they’re doing.” What’s worse is that foreseeable environmental consequences are being ignored. Burgum has cited concerns for migratory birds and whales as justification for shutting downoffshore wind projects. Yet on August 26, the Interior Department announced plans to hold 30 offshore oil and gas lease auctions over the next 15 years. Offshore drilling has been shown to be especially harmful to marine animals. Seismic blasting can result in hearing loss, which affects the ability of whales to breed and communicate. “It’s clear that actual energy development is being approached from a position of political theater, rather than practicality,” Egan writes. Interior officials are working overtime to roll back environmental regulations around mining, despite local concerns about a scarcity of fresh water supplies. “Given the administration’s aggressive antipathy for environmental regulations, experts say it’s impossible to believe that the Interior Department’s sudden conservationist concerns around solar and wind impacts are being made in good faith,” Egan reports. “It’s not like the Biden administration stopped permitting oil and gas development. There’s lots of oil and gas development,” said Alex Klass. “They just also tried to prioritize wind and solar. Here they’re saying, ‘Not only are we not going to prioritize [wind and solar], we’re going to try to shut it down entirely.’” Remember when Republicans said government should not be picking winners and losers in the marketplace? Now they are doing much more than picking winners; they are effectively banning entire industries from competing both at home andabroad. Tyrannosaurus Don has decreed he wants renewable energy destroyed, and his minions are falling all over themselves to execute his wishes — emphasis on “execute.” My colleagueTina Caseycalls the fake president “a malevolently incompetent clown.” She’s right, although even that description may be too mild. The willfully malicious destruction of the clean energy industry is inflicting real harm on communities all across the US, many of them in red states.Trump II — The Revenge Touris the most vicious campaign since Sherman’s scorched earth policy on his infamous March To The Sea.

    "full_text": "The global construction industry is at an inflection point. Mass timber has moved from an architectural curiosity to a material that countries are embracing as part of the climate and housing solution. It offers the ability to lock carbon into buildings while displacing concrete and steel, two of the most emissions intensive materials in use today. Canada has a chance to be a leader, but that depends on how it learns from international experience and positions itself in export markets that will be increasingly contested. This is one of the final articles in my series examining the role of mass timber in Canada’s housing and climate future. Thefirst piecelaid out Canada’s timber moment, framing CLT and modular construction as the fastest lever for addressing housing shortages, jobs, and embodied carbon. Thesecondexplored how Mark Carney’s housing initiative could industrialize the sector through pre-approved designs, offtake contracts, and regional factories. Thethirdexplored the requirement for vertical integration within the industry to maximize efficiencies. Thefourthshowed how CLT displacement could bend the demand curves for cement and steel, making their decarbonization pathways more realistic. Thefifthdemonstrated that from harvest to housing, CLT already locks away more carbon than it emits, strengthening its climate case. Thesixthturned to the forestry supply chain, arguing that electrification of harvesting, transport, and processing is essential to maintaining CLT’s carbon advantage. Theseventhpiece addressed systemic barriers, focusing on high insurance costs and bespoke code approvals, and argued that normalizing mass timber in regulatory and financial frameworks is the key to scaling. Theeighthpiece, arguably one that should have been much earlier in the series, explored the various technologies in mass timber and its currently dominant form, cross-laminated timber (CLT). This piece assesses the global leaders, opportunities and competition for Canada’s mass timber industry and considers lessons to learn. Austria and Germany are the starting point for the modern story of cross laminated timber. In the 1990s, sawmills in the Alps were facing limited export options for dimensional lumber and needed to create more value from their forests. They began experimenting with layering boards at right angles and bonding them into panels. That innovation became CLT, which has since defined mass timber. Austrian firms like Binderholz and KLH and German counterparts scaled quickly, vertically integrated with sawmills, and made exports a central part of their business model. By doing so they set global standards for quality and certification and established durable advantages. The lesson for Canada is clear. Building scale, integrating with the existing sawmilling industry, and thinking globally from the outset are what created the first movers’ leadership positions. Finland and Sweden show a different pathway, one where government strategy and corporate giants moved in lockstep. Finland’s national wood building program and code reforms in 2011 increased the share of wood in mid-rise construction tenfold within five years. Companies like Stora Enso and Metsä Wood treated CLT and LVL as strategic investments and built massive factories to supply both domestic and export markets. Sweden leaned on a strong domestic preference for sustainable housing, and now about a quarter of its new multi-family buildings are timber. These countries demonstrate that a coordinated strategy involving government policy, corporate investment, and education can accelerate adoption far beyond what market forces alone would deliver. Canada should take note. Without major forestry firms treating mass timber as a core business, the country risks falling behind. Japan is an interesting hybrid. It has a cultural tradition of wood architecture but had shifted to concrete and steel in its modern cities. Recognizing underused cedar forests and a need to reduce emissions, the government passed laws requiring wood in public buildings. This was followed by the creation of national CLT standards and the establishment of domestic plants. Japanese companies adapted mass timber to local conditions, using cedar and cypress rather than spruce and pine, and accounting for seismic requirements in their engineering. While Japan is not likely to become an exporter, it is a valuable market and an example of how standards, public procurement, and product adaptation can grow an industry. For Canada, the lesson is that clear rules, public leadership, and respect for local resource realities drive adoption. The United States is both Canada’s largest opportunity and its most direct competitor. For years, Canadian producers supplied many of the U.S. demonstration projects because domestic production was minimal. That changed after the 2021 International Building Code allowed timber high-rises up to 18 stories. Since then, U.S. production has surged, with regional hubs in the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast building out significant capacity. Walmart’s new headquarters in Arkansas is being built with timber supplied by a local plant. The United States is forecast to demand millions of cubic meters of mass timber annually by 2035. Canadian companies will have room to participate, especially in regions close to the border, but they will be competing against a growing base of American producers. Differentiation on service, specialty products, and reliability will be essential. China is the wildcard. Today it has only a handful of CLT and glulam plants and all of them rely on imported lumber. Canadian SPF and Douglas fir are already significant inputs. The government’s dual carbon goals and its push for prefabricated construction are driving interest in timber, and most Chinese producers expect double-digit growth in coming years. In the short term, China is an export opportunity for Canadian lumber and possibly finished panels. In the longer term, it could be a competitor if it decides to scale manufacturing in the way it has with solar panels or wind turbines. That would mean importing logs, making panels in vast factories, and exporting them at low cost. Canada cannot ignore this possibility, even if it is years away. Brazil and Latin America are also beginning to appear on the map. Brazil’s Urbem plant, with capacity for 50,000 cubic meters of CLT and the same of glulam annually, is the first large-scale facility in the region. It uses fast-growing plantation pine and eucalyptus, which can be harvested in less than 20 years. Chile has smaller pilot projects and is considering expansion. These countries have cost advantages in labor and raw material and could become exporters within a decade. Canada should not assume that only Europe and North America will dominate global trade. Competition can come from the Global South as well. Taken together, these case studies provide a set of lessons for Canada. Integration across the value chain from forestry to finished product lowers costs and creates resilience. Supportive policies that normalize timber in building codes and public procurement accelerate domestic demand. Scale and automation drive competitiveness in export markets. Branding that emphasizes sustainability and carbon credentials builds market preference. Without these elements, Canada will remain a secondary player. With them, it could be a leader. In terms of market opportunities, the United States will remain the largest and most accessible export destination. Canada should focus on regions where it has logistical advantages, such as Eastern Canada serving the Northeast U.S. and Western Canada serving the Pacific Northwest. Asia presents a mix of opportunities. Japan and South Korea are receptive markets with cultural acceptance of wood. China is a short-term opportunity but a long-term challenge. Southeast Asia and city-states like Singapore are beginning to explore timber as part of their climate strategies. Emerging markets in Latin America and Africa may not import large volumes soon, but they are potential partners for Canadian expertise and technology transfer. The domestic market is just as important. Without strong local demand, Canadian producers cannot achieve the economies of scale that allow them to compete globally. Public procurement mandates, embodied carbon rules, and continued investment in building codes will ensure that Canadian plants have a reliable base load of projects. That, in turn, supports the investments needed to expand capacity for export. Mass timber is not just another building material. It sits at the intersection of climate action, industrial strategy, and housing policy. Austria and Germany show what happens when an industry scales early and integrates vertically. Finland and Sweden demonstrate the impact of national strategy and corporate commitment. Japan illustrates the power of standards and public procurement. The United States shows how fast demand can grow once codes change. China and Brazil highlight both new markets and future competitors. Canada has all the raw materials it needs and a growing base of skilled companies. The choice now is whether to remain a supplier of dimensional lumber or become a global exporter of high-value, carbon-storing building systems.

    "full_text": "Mindanao in the Philippines, the southernmost island, is a power-hungry but energy-starved province. Like much of the Philippines, it is highly dependent on fossil fuels, but also has the highest potential for renewable energy in terms of wind (onshore and offshore), hydroelectric, geothermal, and solar. A significant step toward a cleaner energy future for Mindanao’s commercial and agricultural sectors was announced following a major solar power agreement between Berde Renewables, KCC Malls, and Biotech Farms. The landmark 8.4 MWp solar power purchase agreement (PPA) will provide clean, cost-efficient energy to three KCC Malls and a Biotech Farms facility, highlighting a growing trend of sustainable business practices in the region. Under the “zero-CAPEX” model, Berde Renewables, backed by global infrastructure investor I Squared Capital, will fully fund the project, including its construction, operation, and maintenance. This arrangement allows KCC Malls and Biotech Farms to integrate renewable energy without any upfront capital investment, making the transition to solar power more accessible for businesses. Once operational, the projects are expected to generate approximately 13 million kWh of clean energy annually, leading to an estimated ₱5.8 million in monthly savings and offsetting 9,600 tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year. Officials from both KCC Malls and Biotech Farms expressed their commitment to sustainability. KCC Malls CEO Arvin Chan noted that the partnership reflects the company’s efforts to modernize and enhance its sustainability standards. Meanwhile, Biotech Farms Renewable Energy Director Rainnyl Chiang emphasized that the initiative will help secure a stable power supply while reducing the company’s environmental footprint. This agreement is a powerful demonstration of the shift in Mindanao’s energy landscape and could have a significant ripple effect on the region’s renewable energy (RE) scene. The partnership shows that major players in energy-intensive sectors like retail and agriculture are now ready to invest in large-scale RE projects. This move is particularly impactful for Mindanao, which has historically relied on a mix of hydropower and fossil fuels, with an increasing dependence on the latter in recent years. The deal validates the zero-CAPEX PPA model as a viable and attractive solution for businesses looking to adopt solar power. This financial model can encourage other companies to follow suit, overcoming the major barrier of high initial installation costs. As more large corporations make the switch, it builds momentum for the widespread adoption of renewable energy, creating a more robust and decentralized energy grid. This shift could help Mindanao reduce its reliance on traditional, and often more expensive, fossil fuels.

    "full_text": "Last Updated on:31st August 2025, 02:35 am Yesterday, I reported on theUSA’s top selling electric vehicle models in the 2nd quarter, and also reported thatUS EV sales were down 6% in Q2year over year — entirely because of Tesla’s sales drop. But, looking more broadly, how are different auto brands and auto groups ranked in terms of the country’s EV sales? Let’s have a look. (Note that all of these charts are better viewed on a laptop/desktop computer than on a phone.) So, yes, despite Tesla’s big sales drop year over year (and even more so going back two years), the US electric vehicle brand still dominates US EV sales. The company accounted for 48.5% of the country’s EV sales last quarter. With almost 144,000 sales, Tesla had more than four times as many sales as #2 Chevrolet. That’s where we are. Behind those two leading brands, Ford and Hyundai are in a tight race for #3, with 5.5% and 5.3% share of the US EV market, respectively. (Ford needs to step it up if the brand wants to stay on the podium.) Overall, though, frankly, anything under 50,000 quarterly EV sales from Chevrolet, Ford, and Hyundai is unsatisfactory, inadequate. They can do better. Cadillac, BMW, and Rivian are next in line, but these are premium brands, so it’s a little more acceptable to have just over 10,000 sales a quarter, but I hope we see them all double those numbers before too long. I know many people prefer to look at things by auto group, though, not just brand. So, let’s look at those rankings now. Obviously, Tesla is in the same position, since it doesn’t have multiple brands. GM then steps up quite a lot to solidify 2nd place. The company’s 15.2% of the market was up significantly from its10.8% of the market in Q1 2025. Meanwhile, 3rd place Hyundai–Kia’s share of the US EV market dropped a little bit from 7.8% in Q1 to 7.3% in Q2. Volume was also down from almost 23,000 to almost 21,500. Then, basically, the ranking trails off. Ford’s got 5.5% share of the market, Honda’s got 4.1% of the market, BMW Group and Volkswagen Group have 3.7% of the market each, Rivian has 3.6% of the market, and so on and so on.

    "full_text": "There are more ways to store energy than just using batteries. Some are using fire bricks, particularly for process heat for industries that rely on high heat in manufacturing. Others propose an arrangement ofmassive concrete blocksthat move up and down like the weights of a giant grandfather clock, converting kinetic energy to potential energy and back again. In Finland, two intrepid engineers began experimenting with a sand battery a few years ago. As we reported when the firstprototypewas unveiled three years ago, the idea of a sand battery began with two Finnish engineers, Markku Ylönen and Tommi Eronen. The concept is simplicity itself. Make a really big pile of sand. Heat it with excess renewable electricity to around 500°C (932°F), then use that heat later to heat homes, factories, even swimming pools. They say the sand can stay hot for 3 months or more. The pair have founded Polar Night Energy, which constructed a prototype consisting of 100 tons of sand inside what looks like a silo in the town of Kankaanpää. Many Americans are unfamiliar with the concept of district heating, but it is widely used in other counties, especially in Scandinavia where keeping schools, municipal buildings, arenas, factories, and homes warm in winter is a challenge. Loviisan Lämpöis a Finnish district heating company that supplies district heating to customers in Loviisa, Pukkila, Pornainen, and Pyhtää. It has collaborated with Polar Night on a new sand battery — one that is much larger than the prototype — which began operating in the city of Pornainen in southern Finland this month, where it is expected to reduce carbon emissions from district heating by 70 percent. Previously, the majority of heat needed for the system came from burning oil, but that has now been completely eliminated. The system will continue to burn wood chips to supplement the sand battery. Wood chips are at least carbon neutral, although not an ideal solution since it takes years for trees to grow but only minutes for the chips to burn. At the commissioning ceremony for the new battery, Mikko Paajanen, CEO of Loviisan Lämpö, said, “A couple of years ago, we started considering how to take district heating in Pornainen to the next level. It would have been easy to simply replace the old wood chip power plant with a new one of the same kind, but that didn’t align with our goals. We evaluated every possible alternative, and the Sand Battery proved to be the best option.” The battery is a 42 foot tall, 50 foot wide steel cylinder filled with 2,000 tons of crushed stone. According toFast Company, when extra renewable electricity is available, the system uses it to heat up the crushed stone, where it is stored until needed. Then the heat from the battery travels to other buildings through a system of pipes filled with hot water. Each building has its own equipment to distribute the heat to radiators, floor heaters, or other heating devices. “We have already learnt that our system has even more potential than we initially calculated. It’s been a positive surprise,” said Ylönen after the prototype was placed in service. “Whenever there’s a high surge of available green electricity, we want to be able to get it into the storage really quickly.” The need to use energy more wisely was driven home for Finns after Russia stopped providing electricity, methane, and oil to Finland when it voted to join NATO. Finland and Russia share a common border. The sand battery is simplicity itself. “We just heat air and [circulate it] through sand,” says Liisa Naskali, COO of Polar Night Energy. But materials other than sand can be used. The new battery actually uses crushed soapstone chips from a local fireplace manufacturer. Sand, or other material crushed into sand-size particles, has the ability to store heat for weeks. Unlike some other batteries, the system doesn’t rely on chemicals, doesn’t degrade, and won’t catch on fire. In operation, the sand battery has demonstrated a round trip efficiency of 90 percent. Inside the steel tank, a heat exchanger and a closed loop system are used to circulate the heat. Software runs heaters when electricity prices are low. So far this summer, the district heating operator has paid only about 10 percent of the average price of electricity because heating the system only occurred at optimal times. That helps make the technology cost competitive, although the initial installation cost is fairly high. Polar Night is now in talks with other district heating companies and factory owners with a need for high temperature process heat. For the company, the project in Pornainen is a critical proof point. “This is really important for us because now we can show that this really works,” a spokesperson for Polar Night said. Polar Night and its partners see abright financial futurefor sand batteries because they can participate in electricity reserve markets, reduce dependence on single energy sources in heat production, and serve as an excellent example of sector integration between electricity and heat. “For us, the sand battery is a great commercial investment, but we also wanted to boldly support an innovative solution that benefits customers, the municipality, and the entire electricity market. This is a concrete example of a cost efficient and sustainable investment. If it works here, it will work anywhere,” said Sauli Antila, the investment director at CapMan Infra, the corporate owner of Loviisan Lämpö. The profitability of the sand battery is based on charging it according to electricity prices and Fingrid’s reserve markets. Its large storage capacity enables balancing the electricity grid and optimizing consumption over several days or even weeks. The reserve market operations and optimization of the Pornainen Sand Battery are managed by the software unit division of Elisa Industriq. “The Pornainen plant can be adjusted quickly and precisely, and it also has a remarkably long energy buffer, making it well suited for reserve market optimization. Our AI solution automatically identifies the best times to charge and discharge the Sand Battery and allocates flexibility capacity to the reserve products that need it most. Continuous optimization makes it a genuinely profitable investment,” explained Jukka-Pekka Salmenkaita, vice president of AI and special projects at Elisa Industriq. Polar Night has a clear vision for the future. Construction of an electricity production pilot will begin in the coming weeks in Valkeakoski, Finland, and the company is in active negotiations for several large-scale thermal storage projects in district heating, hot air, and process steam production. “Industrial applications are particularly promising, especially where heat above 100°C is required, something electric boilers and heat pumps cannot provide,” said Polar Night COO Liisa Naskali. This technology is never going to replace grid-scale battery storage, but could be useful in many situations where battery storage is not. A comment on the YouTube video below complained, “Not a word about return on investment in the presentation. That means it’ll never pay off. They just wasted taxpayers’ money to stroke their own egos.” MAGAlomaniacs are everywhere these days.

    "full_text": "Induction cookingis a new concept for most people. Until now, most food preparation by professional chefs has been done over a methane or propane flame. Cooking with electric burners is too slow and controlling the heat of the pots and pans too imprecise for top chefs. The single most prominent feature of most commercial kitchens is an enormous 6- or 8-burner gas stove. In recent years, restaurants and professional chefs have bitterly opposed state or local laws thatprohibit gas stoves. Government overreach! Woke mind virus! An attack on democracy, they claim. Those sorts of arguments led to the defeat of an effort by Berkeley, California, to ban new methane gas installations, even though the latest research indicates cooking with gas releases contaminants into the air inside the kitchens of our restaurants and homes. New technologies often get pushback from those who oppose change. The automobile was despised by many who were used to horses and mules. The electric guitar almost caused a riot at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. Microwave ovens would interfere with human hearts, and cell phones caused brain cancer. And please, let’s not get started on solar and wind, which some say are spawn of the devil! What is induction cooking, anyway? For the answer to that question, we turned toWikipedia: “Induction cooking is a cooking process using direct electrical induction heating of cookware, rather than relying on flames or heating elements. Induction cooking allows high power and very rapid increases in temperature to be achieved: changes in heat settings are instantaneous. “Pots or pans with suitable bases are placed on an induction electric stove which generally has a heat-proof glass-ceramic surface above a coil of copper wire with an alternating electric current passing through it. The resulting oscillating magnetic field induces an electrical current in the cookware, which is converted into heat by resistance. “To work with induction, cookware must contain a ferromagnetic metal such as cast iron or some stainless steels. Induction tops typically will not heat copper or aluminum cookware because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current. “Induction cooking is among the most efficient ways of cooking, which means it produces less waste heat and it can be quickly turned on and off. Induction has safety advantages compared to gas stoves and emits no air pollution into the kitchen.” Whatever the kerfuffle about induction cooking in certain circles,Bloombergreports that some top level professional chefs are beginning to embrace the new technology. Ikoyi, a Michelin two-star restaurant in London, installed a four-unit induction cooktop over two years ago. While head chef Jeremy Chan says he still loves the emotional experience of cooking with gas, he chose induction for its safety, efficiency, and practicality. It gives him confidence that his chefs can follow his recipes absolutely to the letter. The precise settings on the induction stove mean Chan’s recipes can be carried out to exact specifications by his staff, with no room for interpretation as there would be with instructions like “a low flame.” Chan said, “There’s less human error. You can be more precise in a more foolproof way. You can just say set it to, say, 3.5. There’s nothing to interpret there.” He now cooks on an induction cooktop at home. “As much as I love [gas], I’m never going back to it.” There are no definitive statistics on how many professional kitchens have switched to induction cooktops, but the industry expertsBloombergspoke with said they are seeing an uptick in demand for induction, but not necessarily for environmental reasons. “They are really interested in the performance benefits of electric over gas,” said John Cunningham, chief executive of the Foodservice Equipment Association in the UK, which represents manufacturers of stoves and ovens. Some of its members now sell more electric than gas equipment. Though, across the industry, gas is still the leader, he said. One feature ofinduction cooktopsis they do not need a lot of electrical power to operate. In fact, many one- and two-element units can be plugged into a conventional 120-volt wall outlet. But residential stoves all have an oven for baking and broiling. The oven requires a lot of electricity when in use, which may require a 40-amp 240-volt outlet or higher. If a family wants to replace a conventional gas stove with an electric stove, adding the wiring needed can be an expensive proposition. In some cases, the entry panel in the home may need an upgrade, which could make the cost of switching to electricity too high for some. How do induction stove manufacturers handle that situation? Channing Street Copper Company has an innovative solution. Cofounder Sam Calisch toldFast Companyit has developed a range for residential use that includes a lithium-ion battery. The battery is charged by electricity from a standard wall outlet. It then provides the power for both the four-burner cooktop and the oven when required. Calish co-wrote a book with Saul Griffith calledElectrifythat advocates for electrifying everything in order to reduce atmospheric pollution and address global warming. That book brought him to the attention of Democrats in Congress who were working on the Inflation Reduction Act during the Biden administration. The new stove is calledCharlieand was designed to meet the need for a conventional 30-inch-wide, 4-element residential range that was more efficient and less polluting than a typical gas range without the need for expensive electrical upgrades. Because it has a battery, Charlie can reduce demand on the electrical grid, because when in use, it draws power from the battery, not an electrical outlet. The battery also means Charlie can continue to cook food for up to 5 days during a power outage if just the induction units are used, or 1 day if the oven is used. The oven heats up four times faster than a traditional gas oven and the temperature can be more precisely controlled. When designing the stove, the company found what customers disliked most about induction appliances was navigating touchscreens and digital controls, so Charlie has good old fashioned knobs, which people are more familiar with. Automakers are also finding many drivers prefer traditional knobs and switches in their cars rather than controls activated from a touchscreen. Charlie is fairly pricey at $5,999. It currently qualifies for a 30% federal tax credit, but be sure to check with your accountant first. Virtually all such tax credits are being eliminated by the failed administration currently in office. Still, for commercial landlords interested in converting from gas to electric, avoiding the cost of expensive electrical upgrades to multiple apartments in older buildings may offset some of the expense of the stoves. The practical benefits of cooking with electricity include less carbon dioxide and oxides of nitrogen inside the home, but those are not the reasons most people would cite when considering an induction stove. The thing that really gets people’s attention is the precision control of cooking temperatures induction stoves make possible. “The first time I made a grilled cheese on our stove, I was shocked,” Calish says. “I’d never made a grilled cheese that uniform and perfectly golden brown.” When he makes falafel, he says the oil stays at exactly the right temperature, never getting too hot and filling the kitchen with smoke. Is an induction stove the right choice for everyone? Of course not, just as an electric car is not the right choice for every driver. But as the word spreads, more people will decide they want that level of precision when cooking and the objections will begin to fall away. And, of course, as with all new technologies, prices will begin to fall as more units get sold and economies of scale kick in. 20 years ago, a digital TV cost $5,000 or more. My wife and I paid $2,000 for one 5 years later. Today, they can be had for around $300. The curtain falls, time passes, and change happens. Induction cooking technology will prevail eventually not because of some woke mind virus but because it is a better way to cook.

    "full_text": "If you haven’t subscribed to Teresa Hanafin’s weekly newsletter at theBoston Globe, you’ve missed the pleasure of reading the longtime editorialist’s acerbic wit and hard-hitting interpretation of current events. This week’snewsletterwas entertaining, as always, but it also contained a bit of information I hadn’t come across previously: a “soft secession” movement by Democratic governors. They’re working behind the scenes in ways that could reshape the US government, and one endeavor focuses on the Electoral College. Did you know the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC) has secured 209 electoral votes? First, it makes sense to offer a quick overview of the current US Electoral College system. To be awarded the presidency, a candidate must win at least 270 of the 538 available electoral votes. The US Constitution gives state legislatures the right to choose how presidential electors are chosen. Since the 19th century, each state (with the exceptions of Maine and Nebraska)has awardedits electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote in that state. The US Electoral Collegedevaluesthe voting power of individuals in states far from the national median partisanship. This makes the likelihood of casting a pivotal vote for a presidential candidate quite small for many voters and disproportionately likely for others. But under the NPVIC, states commit to award their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote instead. The Compact will go into effect only when states controlling at least 270 electoral votes have joined. The National Popular Vote non-profit argues that the national popular vote winner should become President — the US presidential election system would convert to one-person, one-vote. It would also inspire candidates to campaign in all 50 states; in 2024, 94% of the general election campaign events took place in just seven states. To say it another way, 43 states and 80% of US voters were on the sidelines. It has been enacted into law by 17 states and DC with 209 electoral votes (status in the states). It needs an additional 61 electoral votes to go into effect. This will guarantee that the candidate receiving the most popular votes nationwide will get enough Electoral College votes to become President. To develop this conversation, let’s look at an interesting statistic in Hanafin’s newsletter: more than half of the 19 states that pay more to the feds than they get back are blue states. The divide between so-called “giver” states and “taker” states means that blue states are subsidizing red states. According to political analyst Chris Armitage, 23 Democratic attorneys general nowgatheron near-daily Zoom calls — running strategy sessions, drafting legal briefs, filing lawsuits within hours of executive orders. “The infrastructure is built. The legal precedents are established. The money is there.” Armitage claims. “Blue states have spent two years sharpening these tools.” When the blue state governors meet again next week, the agenda, according to three sources, includes a discussion of whether to coordinate state tax policy to offset federal cuts. As blue states prepare to deny federal agents access to their databases, their highways, maybe even their airspace, the soft secession isn’t coming, according to Armitage: “It’s here.” Climate change, like voting in a democracy, is a collective action problem — a conflict between the individual interest and the group interest. What have researchersconcludedabout higher income, better educated voters — like those who typically live in blue states? They have a higher likelihood of following political developments, voting, and donating to campaigns. Voters who believe climate change is an important issue are significantly more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate. They also tend to offer greater support for climate action. Because fossil fuels are tied to urban air pollution, city residents could also be more favorable toward renewables, regardless of party, in upcoming elections. It seems that many individuals hesitate to expend resources and effort to reduce their carbon footprints, as they recognize that their actions have only a marginal impact on the global carbon budget. Yet elections certainly influence collective action on problems like environmental pollution and climate change. Matthew Burgess, CIRES Fellow and C-SEF director,explainswhy, even if climate change isn’t voters’ top issue, it is still such a strong predictor of their future voting. “One reason might be that most people see the evidence for climate change as so strong that, if a candidate were to deny or minimize that issue, they might trust that candidate less on other issues,” Burgess said. “Another reason might be that voters are beginning to see a connection between climate change and the kitchen table issues they care about more, like the economy, security, and health. But we can’t say for sure, and this is a key question for future research.” One way to make sense of the correlation between active participation in a democracy and the desire for climate actionis to examineemissions per voter. A cautious or conservative approach to estimating emissions responsibility of voters is to equally apportion the emissions total to the total electoral districts that elect members of Congress and then give equal responsibility to every registered voter in those districts. A second way — with a very different outcome for the climate — is to apportion the projected emissions (in)action from an election only to winning electoral districts. In either approach, the potential climate responsibility of voting is higher than most individual lifestyle decisions that the average person has the opportunity to make. Important federal climate policies emerged during the Biden administration, including pathways to clean energy, investments in underserved and more vulnerable communities, and participation in international climate treaties. Of course, those policies were the result of voters’ choices in the 2020 elections. The Trump Administrationhas slashedeverything from participation in theParis AgreementtoEV incentivestooffshore wind installations. Yet efforts continue to return climate action to the US political agenda. For example, the Environmental Voter Project (EVP)identifiesmillions of non-voting environmentalists and turns them into consistent voters. They estimate that 11.2 million environmentalists did not vote in the 2024 presidential election, and they conclude that many more skip midterm, state, and local elections. According to their website, they are identifying these non-voting environmentalists and “efficiently converting them into a critical mass of consistent voters that will soon be too big for politicians to ignore.” EVP founder Nathaniel Stinnettsaysthat, in our increasingly isolated lives, it’s important to connect with other people who have shared values and try to accomplish something together. “Good climate policy only happens when policymakers feel political pressure to lead on climate,” he adds. If we dig back into to the soft secession idea, we find that theRegional Greenhouse Gas Initiative’s 11 states have reduced emissions by 50% while the federal government rolled back climate regulations. TheUS Climate Alliance’s 24 governors represent 60% of the US economy. Many US states are building a political infrastructure and governance that operates even more separately from the US government. Changes to the Electoral College via National Popular Vote action could make all the difference in future climate mitigation. Let’s make it happen!

    "full_text": "Last Updated on:1st September 2025, 11:25 am Cry me a river. Wait, make that two rivers. On Friday, August 29, the Trump administration yanked another rug out from under the US offshore wind industry, sending thousands of construction jobs spinning into the black hole of malevolent incompetence that passes for the US government these days. How many of those jobs were held by Trump voters remains to be counted, but … yeah, cry me a river. USA Todaytook stock of the situation on August 27, shortly after Trump’s Interior Secretary, Doug Burgum, single-handedly shut down theRevolution Windoffshore project in New England. The work was 80% complete but hundreds of workers were still busy tying up the loose ends when they were all sent home by Secretary Burgum. “A lot of building trades workers, a lot of union workers,voted for Donald Trump and his team. But they didn’t vote to have union jobs shut down,” Rhode Island AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley toldUSA Today. “It shouldn’t work like this.” Actually, it does work like this, and they did vote to have their jobs shut down. Trump’santipathy to wind turbinesis a well-known fact that he has proclaimed often, and loudly, ever since first campaigning for President in 2016. That was nine years ago. That makes nine years of promising tokill the US wind industry, onshore and off, right on up to and including the campaign year of 2024. Last year, Trump also promised that the US wouldhave “only two sexes”if he won the office again. Apparently some voters decided that having two sexes, and only two sexes, was more important than, you know, making a living. “For our folks, this is work, this is make or break for them,” Crowley also toldUSA Today. “When you get a chance to work on a project that’s going to be around for months at a time, that provides you and your family such a sense of stability. And to have this happen? I’ve never seen anything like this before.” In the weeks following Election Day 2024,Associated Presswas among those noting that support for Democratic candidates continues to run high amongunionized workersand others holding construction jobs, so it’s not clear that Crowley’s observation is a by-the-numbers reflection of the Trump votes cast by people who have a personal interest in working for a living. Still,APwas also among those emphasizing that the trend has been shifting towards Republican candidates in general, and Trump in particular. “But with Trump’s populist appeal, his working-class base saw a decent share of union rank-and-file voting for Republicans this year,”APreported on November 23 last year. “Working-class voters helped Republicans make steady election gains this year and expanded a coalition that increasingly includes rank-and-file union members,”APadded. If that is indeed the case, then the Rhode Island wind workers who voted for Trump will have plenty of company as they cool their heels around the kitchen table. Revolution Wind is just one among several parts of the US offshore wind industry that were already in motion when Trump took office with intent to kill. That brings us to Friday, August 29, the day when Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy helped to ensure that the bleeding of union jobs continues. Duffy issued an order clawing back$679 million in federal fundsthat had been allocated for 12 portside improvement projects that were to have supported the offshore wind industry, funded through his agency’s Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects program and the Port Infrastructure Development Program. So, there go more jobs. They are probably not coming back. The offshore wind industry, on the other hand, will be just fine. The technology is not going anywhere, and there are plenty of opportunities to create new jobs building offshore wind farms in other countries. The reaction to Friday’s announcement was swift, not that it matters. The Republican majority in Congress has gleefully permitted the President to overr-reach his Constitutional authority on a daily basis ever since January 20. Why should August 29 be any different. Here’s a representative sample from Democratic Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts: “In unlawfully and senselessly cutting hundreds of millions in federal funding to offshore wind projects, Trump just signed a death warrant forthousands of union jobs nationwideand guaranteed that families’ energy bills will continue to skyrocket.” Liz Burdock, president of the offshore wind trade organizationOceantic Network, also pointed out that the impact of the August 29 order will spread far beyond the offshore wind industry. “Offshore wind port development upgrades facilities and capabilities that serve multiple industries,” she said, noting that the offshore wind industry has brought new jobs to seaports by reviving underused and idled facilities, some of which had lain fallow for decades. That’s news toTransportation Secretary Duffyand his gang of taxpayer-paid office workers. “Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Duffy said in a press statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little,” he said, adding insult to injury. Not to worry! Duffy will use the money to make more jobs at US seaports. No harm, no foul amirite? “Where possible, funding will be used to invest in real infrastructure, restoring American maritime dominance,” Duffy’s office declared. That remains to be seen. Meanwhile, as may be expected the axe fell almost entirely on states headed up by Democratic governors. Here’s the list posted by Senator Markey, with the states added in: What do you bet New York Governor Kathy Hochul is on the phone with Trump right now, working to get that $11 million+ project back in motion? Earlier this year, Hochul negotiated a restart ofthe Empire Wind offshore project, with gas pipeline projects in her state as bargaining chips. Perhaps she has another card to play. Let’s see what Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin has to say about this, too. Youngkin is the only Republican governor on Duffy’s hit list, and he must be wondering what he did wrong. After all, Youngkin hasaffirmed his supportfor the Trump agenda all throughout this year. On the other hand, Youngkin is also the rare, if not the only, Republican governor in the US to champion an offshore wind project. WithYoungkin’s support, the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is well underway, safe from the knives of the Trump administration — for now, at least. As of this writing, Youngkin has yet to issue a public response to the loss of more than $60 million in federal funding. Maybe he never will. Why should he? After all, Youngkin is term-limited, and the smart money says a Democratic governor will inherit the whole mess after Election Day in November.

Globally, we’ve also seenTesla sales declining for the past couple of years. The question — quarter after quarter — is whether the US electric car company can rebound and get back to significant sales growth. As I’ve been seeing more promises from Elon Musk pop up regarding “Full Self Driving” expectations for the end of the year, serious predictions (yet again), it got me thinking that there are really two extremely different ways Tesla could end 2025. And it’s not just a matter or more or less sales; it’s a potentially an existential matter for the company, or a world-changing matter for society. Let’s roll through two different scenarios and just list what could result from these totally different realities. Tesla Full Self Driving (Unsupervised) rolls out widely and successfully. Tesla Full Self Driving (Unsupervised) continues to miss timeline targets, isn’t ready for primetime. These are two vastly different possible futures for Tesla and Tesla [NASDAQ:TSLA] shareholders.

    "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report On September 2, 2025,Thyssenkrupp Nuceraofficially wrapped up the purchase of some crucial technology assets from the insolvent Danish electrolyser makerGreen Hydrogen Systems. The court-supervised deal, struck after GHS filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, includes everything from detailedpressurised electrolyserdesign blueprints to the fully outfittedtest facility in Skive, Denmark. Paid in cash through Thyssenkrupp Nucera’s liquid reserves, the high single-digit million euro agreement instantly catapults the German company into the high-pressure segment ofhigh-pressure alkaline electrolysis, strengthening itsgreen hydrogen technologyportfolio. It’s a strategic no-brainer: fast-track R&D, broaden the product lineup beyond atmospheric-pressure units, and sharpen their edge in delivering compressed hydrogen solutions for demanding industrial applications.Industry Context and Historical BackgroundAnyone tracking the hydrogen scene will know howThyssenkrupp Nuceracame to be: a joint venture between Thyssenkrupp and De Nora that blends steelmaking know-how with electrochemical expertise. Over the past five years, this team has earned a reputation as a global leader in electrolyser tech, rolling out flagship scalum 20 MW atmospheric-pressure modules across projects from North America to Asia. Meanwhile,Green Hydrogen Systemshad carved out its own niche with modular high-pressure alkaline plants—but mounting financial headwinds and fierce market competition pushed GHS into bankruptcy in early 2025, setting the stage for this asset sale. What we’re seeing here is emblematic of a wider trend: nimble pioneers getting picked up by larger industrial players with the capital and international reach to scale next-gen innovations.Analysts anticipate the electrolyser market will surge at roughly 30% CAGR through 2030, fueled by corporate net-zero pledges and government stimulus packages. In such a fast-track environment, nabbing exclusive IP for high-pressure operation gives Thyssenkrupp Nucera a serious leg up.How the Technology WorksWhen you strip it down,high-pressure alkaline electrolysisis elegantly simple: water meets an alkaline electrolyte, electrodes, and electricity to split H₂O into hydrogen and oxygen. But by cranking the pressure up to around 35 bar, you get hydrogen right off the bat at industrial pressures—no extra compression skids needed. Inside each cell, a porous diaphragm keeps the cathode (hydrogen side) and the anode (oxygen side) apart as hydroxide ions shuttle through, carrying charge and freeing up gas molecules.

It simplifies hydrogen production and delivery, fortifies Skive’s local economy by preserving vital R&D capabilities, and gives Europe’s zero-carbon journey a serious boost. We can’t wait to see how thesepressurised electrolysersperform in real-world pilot projects—and ultimately how they reshape industrial hydrogen markets around the world, slashing emissions and delivering reliable, cost-effective clean energy solutions.Spread the love Skive, a vibrant town of about 47,000 in central Jutland, has been a hotbed for industrial innovation for decades. The newly acquired facility there is already rigged for both pilot tests and full-scale demos. By tapping into Skive’s skilled workforce and Denmark’s leadership in renewable energy,Thyssenkrupp Nucerakeeps the R&D momentum going without missing a beat. Local technicians and researchers will fine-tune test rigs, experiment with advanced cell materials, refine stack architectures, and dial in digital control systems. It’s a genuineMade in Denmark, made for Denmark’s futurestory, preserving homegrown know-how and anchoring the region’s role at the forefront of green hydrogen research. Switching togreen hydrogen technologyis a cornerstone for decarbonizing sectors that are otherwise tough to crack—and it’s a key part of Europe’s strategy to hit climate goals like those in the Paris Agreement and the EU’s Fit for 55 package. With zero CO₂ emissions at the point of production when powered by renewables, high-pressure alkaline electrolysis ticks all the boxes for cleaner industry. Plus, since the hydrogen comes out of the electrolyser already compressed, downstream energy consumption drops and so does the carbon footprint. On the economic front, Thyssenkrupp Nucera’s move protects hundreds of jobs at the Skive site and stimulates local supply chains—from valve makers to control system integrators—thanks to ongoing maintenance, upgrades, and service contracts that keep cash circulating in the region.Looking AheadLooking ahead, Thyssenkrupp Nucera isn’t content with merely rebrandingGreen Hydrogen Systemsgear; they plan to weave the acquired IP into their own modular roadmap, cooking up next-gen high-pressure electrolyser units. Over the next 18 to 24 months, expect to see pilot installations of these optimized pressurised systems, drawing on lessons from their reliable scalum 20 MW modules.

    "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hold onto your seats—on August 30, 2025,Pure Hydrogen Corporationand California’s fleet guruGTS Groupjust shook things up with a non-binding letter of intent to deployhydrogen fuel cell trucksall across North America. It’s a bold step into the heavyweight arena of commercial trucking and a big moment for the future ofCalifornia clean transport.They’ve got their sights set on both Class 8 tractor units and sturdy hydrogen-powered rigids, aiming to deliver the first trucks in Q4 2025. Whether it’s picking up trash or hauling concrete mixers, these rigs promise the driving range and lightning-fast refuels fleets crave—without the lingering diesel fumes.And let’s be clear: this isn’t some tiny pilot project. It’s a full-throttle strategic push—pending technical due diligence and regulatory sign-offs—and it rides on the momentum of a fresh $1 million capital raise to fuelPure Hydrogen Corporation’s U.S. expansion. Ready to catch this hydrogen haulage wave?Greasing the Skids for Zero-Emission FreightLet’s face it: diesel trucks are the backbone of freight, but they’re also a major culprit behind smog and soot. The U.S. trucking sector hauls over 70% of freight by weight, and in California’s sprawling network, nearly 40 million people breathe air heavy with NOx, CO2 and particulate matter.Pressure’s building from every angle. California’s Advanced Clean Trucks rule is pushing OEMs to bump up zero-emission vehicle sales, while incentive programs slash the price tag for early adopters. On top of that, corporate clients are demanding greener supply chains—so fleet owners have zero room to hide.Where dozero-emission heavy-duty vehiclesfit in? Battery-electric trucks shine for city routes, but long-haul runs and nonstop schedules can push them past their range limits. That’s precisely where hydrogen fuel cells step in: fill up in minutes, keep rolling at peak uptime, and haul every bit of payload without compromise.Here’s the clincher: this LOI pairsPure Hydrogen Corporation’s proven fuel cell tech withGTS Group’s deep leasing network, giving fleets a clear runway to test and scale hydrogen without second-guessing.The Technology Under the HoodThink of a fuel cell stack as a pocket-sized power plant. It combines hydrogen and oxygen in an electrochemical waltz, producing electricity for the motors—and all you get is water vapor. No sparks, no explosions, just smooth, silent power.Onboard, hydrogen sits snug in rugged, high-pressure tanks engineered for safety. The fuel cell modules deliver consistent thrust, letting these trucks tackle steep grades and hefty loads with diesel-like grunt.Yet the story doesn’t end at the tailpipe.Pure Hydrogen Corporationalso builds electrolysers, storage solutions, and refuelling stations, weaving together an end-to-end ecosystem. Picture “plug-and-play” hydrogen docks at warehouse doors or truck stops—slash downtime, ditch logistics headaches.Why It MattersHere’s the bottom line: fleets need emissions-free solutions that don’t skimp on efficiency. Hydrogen answers the call—cutting carbon compliance fees, driving down fuel costs over a truck’s lifetime, and delivering uptime that electric charging can’t touch.And think about upkeep. Fewer moving parts mean less wrench time and lower maintenance bills compared to diesel engines. Plus, fleet managers hedge bets against volatile fuel prices and strained electricity grids by adding hydrogen to the mix.The community wins, too. Cleaner air around ports and depots means healthier neighborhoods, fewer asthma flare-ups, and better ties between fleets and residents. In other words, it’s a win for business and public health alike.Rolling Into the Real WorldSo, what’s actually on the table? Under the LOI,Pure Hydrogen Corporationwill roll out its first Class 8 hydrogen tractor in Q4 2025.GTS Groupwill then hit the road with demos and roadshows, gathering real-world data on range, refuel times, and maintenance.They’re not stopping at tractors—hydrogen rigid trucks for garbage collection and concrete mixing are in the mix, too. Those stop-and-go jobs demand rapid turnarounds and full payloads—trades that hydrogen can handle far better than batteries.Keep in mind, it’s non-binding for now. Next up: technical due diligence, U.S. Department of Transportation approvals, and finalizing contracts. Exact volumes and locations will emerge as both teams nail down the fine print.Behind the ScenesPure Hydrogen Corporationkicked off in 2020, and since then they’ve built a portfolio covering hydrogen vehicles, electrolysers, storage, and refuelling infrastructure. They’ve inked master supply deals across Latin America and North America, fueling their global vision for zero-emission transport.Just this year they closed a $1 million placement with sophisticated investors, boosting R&D and funding their North American push. They’ve got the tech chops and the bankroll to roll.Meanwhile,GTS Groupstands tall as California’s go-to for truck distribution and leasing. With a client base spanning sanitation, construction, and logistics, they’ve got a ready-made audience eager for hydrogen demos. It’s a match that fuses cutting-edge tech with tried-and-true fleet know-how.What’s Next?This LOI could light the fuse for a hydrogen highway network from L.A. to San Francisco and beyond—interstate refuelling stations and urban depots all primed forhydrogen fuel cell trucks. Fleets would finally get the infrastructure they’ve been craving.Don’t be surprised if competing responses pop up: battery makers might sweeten their proposals, diesel giants could fast-track cleaner blends, and policymakers may roll out new incentives as hydrogen builds momentum.One thing’s crystal clear: the race to decarbonize heavy-duty transport is on. If this partnership delivers, you’ll see the hydrogen haulage revolution hit California roads before you know it.

    "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report In a big leap for New Zealand’shydrogen productionroadmap,MyFarm InvestmentsandHiringa Energyare joining forces to build five 5 MW solar farms across Northland. Together, these plants will crank out 25 MW of renewable electricity to power electrolyzers, feeding a steady stream ofgreen hydrogenfor heavy transport under a 10-year power purchase agreement.Solar-to-Hydrogen BlueprintPicture this: top-tier photovoltaic arrays paired with advanced electrolyzers to turn sunshine into storable fuel. Here’s how the magic happens:Solar panelssoak up sunlight and generate electricity.That electricity driveselectrolysis, splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen.Newly mintedgreen hydrogenis compressed and stored for fueling stations.Oxygenis vented or repurposed for industrial use.Backing the TransitionTheMyFarm Solar Fundis raising NZ$14 million from wholesale investors to cover construction and operations. With total project costs at NZ$36 million—secured by a decade-long PPA withHiringa Energy—investors get predictable revenues, lower risk and a front-row seat insustainable energyassets.Policy MomentumNew Zealand’s 2050 net-zero goal hinges on cleaning up transport—especially heavy-duty diesel. The government’s hydrogen strategy zeroes in ongreen hydrogenfor big rigs and industrial feedstocks. This Northland project taps policy incentives and grid-connection support, proving how private capital can fast-track public targets.Investor Appetite and ReturnsEyeing the solar fund? Forecast returns hover around 10–12% per annum, and tax depreciation can push net yields to about 15%. By hosting assets on Syndex, MyFarm injects liquidity into an otherwise illiquid sector. Locked-in power sale prices also shield investors from wholesale volatility.Northland’s RoleWith its high solar irradiance and plenty of farmland, Northland’s the perfect backdrop for solar-to-hydrogen. Once one of NZ’s quieter regions, it’ll gain construction jobs, operations roles and a boost to local services. Plus, adding distributed renewables strengthens the grid’s resilience.Tech and Market IntegrationBalancing intermittent solar power with electrolyzers takes finesse. Thankfully, Hiringa’s hydrogen refueling network guarantees every kilogram produced finds a buyer. On the financing side, MyFarm’s asset syndication expertise keeps investors and stakeholders in sync. Together, they’re laying out a repeatable model for marrying site-hosted solar withelectrolysis.Strategic ImplicationsThis expansion cements both firms at the forefront of New Zealand’s clean energy shift. It demonstrates how private syndicates can mobilize capital into industrial decarbonization outside urban hubs. If it succeeds, this template could roll out across other regions—and even cross the Tasman into Australia-Pacific markets eyeinggreen hydrogen.By linking rural investment, renewable asset development andhydrogen infrastructure, MyFarm and Hiringa are rewriting the playbook on how agrarian capital can back cutting-edge clean tech. As governments and corporations push for zero-emission logistics, these 25 MW of solar-to-hydrogen capacity could kick off a much larger wave.Spread the love Picture this: top-tier photovoltaic arrays paired with advanced electrolyzers to turn sunshine into storable fuel.

    "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Whenever you hearhydrogen fuel cells, chances are you imagine sleek, silent cars that puff only water vapor—and honestly, who wouldn’t love that? But flipping that future into our daily grind takes more than glossy prototypes; it needs savvy policy moves, hands-on expertise and boots-on-the-ground input. That’s the sweet spot whereJennifer Gormanshines.A Foot in the Lab, a Hand in PolicyBack in summer 2025,Gorman, a Public Policy whiz finishing up her master’s atUCLA Luskin, joinedAmerican Honda Motor Co.‘sHydrogen Solutions Teamin California. Forget coffee runs—instead, she dove headfirst into market validation studies forfuel cell technology, navigated sprawling regulations and mapped out workforce strategies to help Honda crank up its hydrogen operations. By lining up commercial and compliance timelines, she steered the team on where to pour research funds and which pilot programs deserved a green light.Fuel Cell 101Imagine ahydrogen fuel cellas an electrochemical wizard: you feed it hydrogen, it teases protons apart from electrons, sends those electrons through a circuit to generate electricity and then marries them back with oxygen—leaving nothing but water vapor and a bit of heat in its wake. Zero tailpipe CO2, full stop.Policy Meets Practice in CaliforniaCaliforniahas been setting the pace since the 1970s—think the original Zero Emission Vehicle program—and today, its Innovative Clean Transit rule tells transit agencies to snap up 100% zero-emission buses by 2029. That ticking clock sends a crystal-clear market signal and piles on pressure for tech developers and fleet operators alike, accelerating timelines and upping the ante.Bridging Skills GapsGorman’s digging revealed a showstopper: with too few technicians trained in high-pressure hydrogen systems, even the slickest fuel cell buses risk gathering dust.

Top-down policies often skip over on-the-ground realities—like mapping out fueling stations or servicing those finicky fuel cell modules.

    "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report We’re thrilled to share thatGuofu Hydrogen Energy, together with its Inner Mongolia arm,Mengfa Guofu Hydrogen Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and the local government ofSiziwang Banner, has kicked off a massive ¥5 billionGreen Hydrogen Hubas part of China’s carbon-neutral push. Nestled in the heart of theInner Mongolia Energyregion, this game-changing project will crank out about 40,000 tonnes of liquid green hydrogen a year, tapping into a whopping 1 GW of wind and solar power. The concept’s straightforward: split water into hydrogen, chill it into a denser form, and ship it nationwide—easier said than done, but oh-so impactful.Scaling Up Clean Energy ProductionRight at the core of this hub are beefy electrolysers—think 1,000 Nm³/h units, roughly 5 MW apiece—pulled by pure renewables viaRenewable Electrolysis. They knock water into hydrogen and oxygen, then whisk the hydrogen off to a top-of-the-line liquefaction plant that churns out 120 tonnes a day. That’sLiquid Hydrogen Productionat scale, solving real-world headaches around storage and transport in one slick, closed-loop system. And because we’ve tuned everything for peak performance in semi-arid conditions, uptime stays sky-high even when the weather’s not playing nice.Powering a National Logistics NetworkProduction’s only half the story. We’re also setting up over 20 multi-fuel stations so industries and fleets can top up on hydrogen, oil, gas, or electricity without breaking a sweat. All of this is orchestrated by a centralHydrogen Logistics Network, ensuring smooth delivery to factories and transport hubs across China. We’ll even layer in real-time tracking and inventory management to dodge bottlenecks and keep everyone in the loop. It’s a huge leap toward slashing carbon footprints in sectors that really need it.Made in China, Made for China’s FutureBy exploiting Inner Mongolia’s vast wind and solar resources, this whole operation stays local—from R&D benches to assembly lines. Local manufacturing hubs will churn out key components, slashing lead times and dependency on imports. That “homegrown” approach lets us move fast and keep costs down, perfectly in line with China’s vision for boosting domestic energy resilience. Plus, customizing electrolysers for the semi-arid climate here? That’s efficiency unlocked.Positive Environmental ImpactHere’s the kicker: green hydrogen is zero-emission at the point of use, only leaving behind water. Industries like steel, chemicals, and heavy transport can swap out their fossil fuels and slash greenhouse gases dramatically. Beyond just cutting carbon, it also helps rebalance local ecosystems by reducing air pollutants. And because we’re running the electrolysers on renewables, we’re also easing grid stress and capturing energy that might otherwise go to waste.Boosting Local EconomiesThis project’s not just green—it’s a local job maker. Hundreds of folks will find work in construction and day-to-day operations, from tech experts to logistics coordinators. Local supply chains get a boost too, as materials and services flow into the region. Similar efforts across the region have bumped up tax revenues, improved local services, and opened doors for skills training. Even farmers and herders stand to earn extra income leasing land or supplying materials. In short, Siziwang Banner’s bottom line gets a healthy shot in the arm.Collaboration Across SectorsIt’s a real team effort. TheSiziwang Bannergovernment handles zoning, policy direction, and power allocation to keep renewables flowing steadily. On the flip side,Guofu Hydrogen Energyand its subsidiary pitch in the technical know-how, project financing, and on-the-ground management. We’re also tapping nearby universities and research institutes to keep R&D fresh and ideas flowing. Together, we’re right in sync with goals set out in the 2024 “Green Hydrogen Industry Action Plan.”Setting a Blueprint for Future ProjectsAs one of China’s largest hubs of its kind, this integrated setup—from electrolysers to storage to refueling stations—is basically a plug-and-play template. Stakeholders see it as the launch pad for swapping out grey hydrogen and cutting emissions at a national scale. And with this blueprint in hand, we can replicate the model in provinces from Guangdong to Xinjiang, scaling quickly without trading off our environmental standards.Aligning with National GoalsThis hub feeds directly into China’s targets: 200,000 tonnes of green hydrogen by 2025 and a leap to one million tonnes by 2027. It slots perfectly into the bigger picture of diversifying energy sources, ramping up renewables, and grabbing the global lead in hydrogen tech. It also underpins efforts to integrate hydrogen into power grids, industrial zones, and even residential heating experiments. It’s proof positive that when local governments, state-backed firms, and private investors team up, big clean-energy wins happen.Looking AheadConstruction’s already in full swing, with the first electrolysers slated to hum by late 2026. When they go live, we’ll be churning out liquid green hydrogen for next-gen vehicles, helping heavy industry go green, and feeding chemical plants across the country. And once the pilot phase wraps, there’s potential to double capacity or spin off sister hubs in other wind-blown provinces. With all the permits secured and policies aligned,Guofu Hydrogen Energyand its partners are charging full steam ahead toward a cleaner, more resilient grid.A Promise of InnovationNo doubt we’ll hit some bumps—scaling up electrolyser capacity and handling cryogenics at this level is no small feat. But with robust government backing, solid VC funding, and a dash of AI-driven controls to optimize performance on the fly, the team’s set to push the envelope. AsGuofu Hydrogen Energy’s leadership puts it, the playbook’s simple: make green hydrogen in bulk, move it smartly, and use it everywhere from transport fleets to industrial plants.At its heart, this isn’t just an industrial complex—it’s a beacon for China’s clean-energy future. By tapping into local resources and forging strong public-private partnerships, Siziwang Banner is well on its way to becoming the nation’s hub for hydrogen logistics and production. That means more jobs, cleaner air, and a real shot at hitting net-zero targets—a story worth getting behind.Spread the love Right at the core of this hub are beefy electrolysers—think 1,000 Nm³/h units, roughly 5 MW apiece—pulled by pure renewables viaRenewable Electrolysis.

It’s proof positive that when local governments, state-backed firms, and private investors team up, big clean-energy wins happen.Looking AheadConstruction’s already in full swing, with the first electrolysers slated to hum by late 2026. When they go live, we’ll be churning out liquid green hydrogen for next-gen vehicles, helping heavy industry go green, and feeding chemical plants across the country. And once the pilot phase wraps, there’s potential to double capacity or spin off sister hubs in other wind-blown provinces. With all the permits secured and policies aligned,Guofu Hydrogen Energyand its partners are charging full steam ahead toward a cleaner, more resilient grid.A Promise of InnovationNo doubt we’ll hit some bumps—scaling up electrolyser capacity and handling cryogenics at this level is no small feat. But with robust government backing, solid VC funding, and a dash of AI-driven controls to optimize performance on the fly, the team’s set to push the envelope. AsGuofu Hydrogen Energy’s leadership puts it, the playbook’s simple: make green hydrogen in bulk, move it smartly, and use it everywhere from transport fleets to industrial plants.At its heart, this isn’t just an industrial complex—it’s a beacon for China’s clean-energy future. By tapping into local resources and forging strong public-private partnerships, Siziwang Banner is well on its way to becoming the nation’s hub for hydrogen logistics and production. That means more jobs, cleaner air, and a real shot at hitting net-zero targets—a story worth getting behind.Spread the love This project’s not just green—it’s a local job maker. Hundreds of folks will find work in construction and day-to-day operations, from tech experts to logistics coordinators. Local supply chains get a boost too, as materials and services flow into the region. Similar efforts across the region have bumped up tax revenues, improved local services, and opened doors for skills training. Even farmers and herders stand to earn extra income leasing land or supplying materials. In short, Siziwang Banner’s bottom line gets a healthy shot in the arm. It’s a real team effort. TheSiziwang Bannergovernment handles zoning, policy direction, and power allocation to keep renewables flowing steadily. On the flip side,Guofu Hydrogen Energyand its subsidiary pitch in the technical know-how, project financing, and on-the-ground management. We’re also tapping nearby universities and research institutes to keep R&D fresh and ideas flowing. Together, we’re right in sync with goals set out in the 2024 “Green Hydrogen Industry Action Plan.”Setting a Blueprint for Future ProjectsAs one of China’s largest hubs of its kind, this integrated setup—from electrolysers to storage to refueling stations—is basically a plug-and-play template. Stakeholders see it as the launch pad for swapping out grey hydrogen and cutting emissions at a national scale. And with this blueprint in hand, we can replicate the model in provinces from Guangdong to Xinjiang, scaling quickly without trading off our environmental standards.Aligning with National GoalsThis hub feeds directly into China’s targets: 200,000 tonnes of green hydrogen by 2025 and a leap to one million tonnes by 2027.

This isn’t a static demo—it’s a real-deal ISR platform flying 12+ hours with 99.5% fewer emissions than diesel drones or manned helicopters, a shining example ofzero-emission technology. Oh, and it pilots itself.Behind the scenes, Northern Europe’s only airship factory went from blueprint to flight-ready hull and propulsion modules in under 18 months. That lean startup hustle turned Kelluu into a defense player almost overnight.Historic ComebackAirships patrolled WWI skies but vanished after WWII amid durability and safety worries. Then came the Hindenburg in 1937, and with it, a fear of hydrogen that drove operators toward scarce, pricey helium. Fast forward to today: cheap, electrolysis-powered hydrogen and tougher carbon targets have blown the dust off lighter-than-air craft. Kelluu isn’t the only one betting on this humble molecule—startups across Europe are prototyping H2-driven dirigibles—but nobody’s steered one straight into NATO drills before. Even better, Kelluu snagged a spot in NATO’sDIANA innovation accelerator, fast-tracking the tech into alliance programs quicker than any rival platform.Fast FactsEndurance: 12+ hoursPayloads: LiDAR, thermal imagers, andAgEagle RedEdge-Pmultispectral camerasNav: AI-driven, GNSS-denied capableDeployment: First hydrogen airship at REPMUS 25 & Atlantic Trident 25Production: Northern Europe’s lone airship factoryWhy NATO’s WatchingConventional ISR tools hit roadblocks in contested airspaces: clouds scramble optics, jammer nets kill GNSS, and batteries conk out after a couple hours. Want to circle a hostile coastline or an Arctic archipelago for days? That’s where Kelluu’s blimp shines. It slips under cloud cover in near silence, shrugging off harsh temps thanks to a hydrogen-safe envelope, and its onboard AI navigates GNSS-denied zones like a champ. Pilots from 30 allied nations eyeballed it during REPMUS 25 in Portugal—NATO’s maritime unmanned systems week—and again at Atlantic Trident 25 in Finland. During REPMUS, operators even tapped its live data feed into multinational C2 systems to test interoperability. Plus, as militaries push forindustrial decarbonizationand green defense initiatives, this platform ticks both boxes: cutting carbon footprints and delivering real-time ISR.Under the HoodThink of it as a tech geek’s dream: a 12-meter envelope crammed with high-pressure hydrogen tanks, a 5 kW fuel cell doing double duty for lift and thrust, and enough buoyancy to lug a 50 kg multi-sensor payload. Kelluu’s patented chassis keeps hydrogen away from hot surfaces, nixing any Hindenburg-era horror stories. The sensor suite? LiDAR for 3D mapping, thermal cameras for perimeter sweeps, and theAgEagle RedEdge-Psnapping pixel-perfect RGB and NIR shots. Onboard AI stitches it all into georeferenced digital twins covering up to 300 km in diameter, in real time. The same hydrogen tanks handle buoyancy and fuel cell needs, so no mid-mission refuel juggling. Even headwinds don’t faze it—the AI tweaks flight controls on the fly. No joystick needed.Civilian Spin-offsThis isn’t just a defense toy.Terrafame, Finland’s nickel and zinc giant, has flown the airship over tailings ponds to map pit walls and track slope stability. Forestry services eye it for inventory checks. Farmers could patch it in for precision agriculture—spotting crop stress or irrigation leaks with minimal fuss. These trials underscore how defense-grade platforms can powersustainable energyefforts and drive real-worldindustrial decarbonizationby mapping critical assets without a hefty carbon bill.Jamming and GNSS-Denied OpsWhen GPS signals vanish under jamming or spoofing, Kelluu’s got your back. Its GNSS-denied navigation relies on onboard sensors and processing to keep the blimp on course—vital when you’re operating beyond the map. That system was put through its paces over the Atlantic, where jamming drills are part of the regular routine.Maverick PerspectiveLook, I’m not here to gush without reservations. Scaling uphydrogen infrastructure—think storage tanks, refueling stations, safety hoops—is a massive headache. Privacy advocates will raise eyebrows at persistent aerial surveillance over civilian zones. And let’s be real: flashy demos can stall if money talks don’t show up. Governments love green buzzwords but often prioritize shells over blimps. Even so, this simplest molecule pulled off longer, cleaner ISR missions that battery-only systems can’t touch. If Europe’s serious aboutsustainable energyand resilient defense, it needs to back projects like this—not just hype electrolyzers and storage tanks.Portugal and Finland on DisplayPortugal’s modern ports and NATO ties made its Atlantic shores the ideal proving ground for REPMUS 25. Less than a month later, Finland—NATO’s newest member since 2023—put the airship through Arctic paces at Atlantic Trident 25. For Lisbon and Helsinki, hosting these drills isn’t just good optics; it’s a chance to steer NATO’s acquisition roadmaps and draw in defense R&D investment. Both venues highlight the platform’s flexibility across wildly different theaters.Next FlightNATO’s nod of approval goes beyond a press photo op—it’s a live-fire audition for future ISR fleets. Next up: stockpilinggreen hydrogenat forward bases, ironing out flight-safety regs, and syncing with existing C2 systems. And budgets? Can defense ministers justify green hydrogen bunkers over ammunition racks, or will this tech stay a shiny demo? Keep tabs on the supply chain: electrolyzer makers, hydrogen producers, logistics firms all stand to gain if H2 aviation truly takes off.

Pilots from 30 allied nations eyeballed it during REPMUS 25 in Portugal—NATO’s maritime unmanned systems week—and again at Atlantic Trident 25 in Finland. During REPMUS, operators even tapped its live data feed into multinational C2 systems to test interoperability. Plus, as militaries push forindustrial decarbonizationand green defense initiatives, this platform ticks both boxes: cutting carbon footprints and delivering real-time ISR.Under the HoodThink of it as a tech geek’s dream: a 12-meter envelope crammed with high-pressure hydrogen tanks, a 5 kW fuel cell doing double duty for lift and thrust, and enough buoyancy to lug a 50 kg multi-sensor payload. Kelluu’s patented chassis keeps hydrogen away from hot surfaces, nixing any Hindenburg-era horror stories. The sensor suite? LiDAR for 3D mapping, thermal cameras for perimeter sweeps, and theAgEagle RedEdge-Psnapping pixel-perfect RGB and NIR shots. Onboard AI stitches it all into georeferenced digital twins covering up to 300 km in diameter, in real time. The same hydrogen tanks handle buoyancy and fuel cell needs, so no mid-mission refuel juggling. Even headwinds don’t faze it—the AI tweaks flight controls on the fly. No joystick needed.Civilian Spin-offsThis isn’t just a defense toy.Terrafame, Finland’s nickel and zinc giant, has flown the airship over tailings ponds to map pit walls and track slope stability. Forestry services eye it for inventory checks. Farmers could patch it in for precision agriculture—spotting crop stress or irrigation leaks with minimal fuss. These trials underscore how defense-grade platforms can powersustainable energyefforts and drive real-worldindustrial decarbonizationby mapping critical assets without a hefty carbon bill.Jamming and GNSS-Denied OpsWhen GPS signals vanish under jamming or spoofing, Kelluu’s got your back. Its GNSS-denied navigation relies on onboard sensors and processing to keep the blimp on course—vital when you’re operating beyond the map. That system was put through its paces over the Atlantic, where jamming drills are part of the regular routine.Maverick PerspectiveLook, I’m not here to gush without reservations. Scaling uphydrogen infrastructure—think storage tanks, refueling stations, safety hoops—is a massive headache. Privacy advocates will raise eyebrows at persistent aerial surveillance over civilian zones. And let’s be real: flashy demos can stall if money talks don’t show up. Governments love green buzzwords but often prioritize shells over blimps. Even so, this simplest molecule pulled off longer, cleaner ISR missions that battery-only systems can’t touch.

    "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Ready for a Green Hydrogen revolution that’s actually rollout-ready? Buckle up!OnSeptember 2, 2025,Electric Hydrogennamed hydrogen industry veteranBruno Forgetas General Manager forEurope MENA. His job? Craft the game plan, ramp up delivery of theHYPRPlantElectrolyzerlineup, and turbocharge operations to keep pace with skyrocketing demand for industrial-scaleRenewable Hydrogen. Since kicking off in 2020 in Devens, MA, Electric Hydrogen has grown to more than 300 employees across Europe and the US. Now, with Bruno in charge over here, the company’s hitting the gas—aiming for gigawatt-scale capacity, new partnerships, and a serious push toward a cleaner energy future. From Uniper’s Green Wilhelmshaven to Infinium’s e-SAF in Texas, they’re stitching together a global footprint to boost industrial competitiveness and shore up energy security.Here’s the Game-ChangerHYPRPlantisn’t some dusty lab prototype—it’s a full-on, modularElectrolyzersolution built for big-time scale and efficiency. Think advanced PEM tech splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using nothing but renewable juice, with everything—from catalysts and membranes to power electronics and control systems—packed into easy-to-stack 20 MW+ units. It’s basically plug-and-play, so firing up a new plant is as smooth as it gets and won’t break the bank. Electric Hydrogen’s already got heavyweight projects signed, like the 200 MW Green Wilhelmshaven site in Germany with Uniper and Infinium’s e-SAF operation in Texas. It’s clear: this tech’s set to redefine the market.Why This Matters NowThe energy game inEurope MENAis shifting fast—tight climate targets, geopolitical curveballs, and an all-out race for energy security. Europe’s Fit for 55 and REPowerEU packages are pushing for massive emissions cuts—Green Hydrogen is top of the list for decarbonizing heavy industries, refineries, and power plants. At the same time, Middle East players are betting big on hydrogen exports and homegrown green-fuel plants to shake up their economies. By roping inBruno Forget, who’s got over two decades in the hydrogen world at Air Liquide, Cummins, and Plug Power, Electric Hydrogen is signaling it’s ready to cut through red tape, grab policy incentives, and nail down giant, multi-hundred-megawatt deals—fast.On-the-Ground ImpactGermany (Wilhelmshaven): Uniper’s Green Wilhelmshaven will host a 200 MWHYPRPlantElectrolyzer, churning out up to 40,000 tonnes of Green Hydrogen a year for industrial and power uses.USA (Texas): Renewable Hydrogen from HYPRPlant units feeds Infinium’s sustainable aviation fuel project, slashing lifecycle emissions on transatlantic flights.Middle East (planned): Partnerships across the GCC aim to tap abundant solar power and desalinated water for gigawatt-scale plants, shipping out hydrogen and ammonia via new pipelines and vessels.These anchor projects prove HYPRPlant can handle anything—from blustery North Sea conditions to blazing Texas sun and arid desert heat. Scaling up also brings huge perks: thousands of new jobs in manufacturing, ops, and maintenance; fresh water treatment and recycling plants to keep theElectrolyzerfeedstock flowing; plus beefed-up ports and pipeline networks that lock in energy security. It’s innovation plus infrastructure—that’s the recipe for a bulletproof hydrogen supply chain.The Fuel Behind the FireAt the heart of everyHYPRPlantsits advanced Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysis tech. It’s up and running in minutes, keeps efficiency high even when renewable inputs wobble, and plays nice across varying loads. Thanks to Electric Hydrogen’s partnership withIngeteam, those 20 MW skids pack top-shelf power electronics and digital controls, tweaking voltage, current, and temperature in real time. The payoff? Over 70% energy conversion efficiency and a potential 20% cut in the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) compared to older systems. And because the setup’s modular, you can service a single unit without killing the whole plant’s uptime.Power Moves Behind the ScenesThis isn’t just about slick tech—it’s about muscle in the market. Electric Hydrogen is lining up green bonds, calling in export credit agencies, and forging alliances with regional engineering partners to fast-track permits, construction, and commissioning. With 300+ staff worldwide, they’re opening local hubs in Frankfurt, Dubai, and Barcelona so they can talk the talk, navigate regional rules, and hit the ground running. Bruno Forget’s history of sealing big deals atAir Liquide,Cummins, andPlug Powerwill be gold when it comes to landing long-term offtake agreements with steel mills, refineries, and chemical plants. They’re also working on hydrogen certification standards and digital tracking to tick all the emerging EU boxes on Guarantees of Origin and carbon pricing. Meanwhile, the Devens R&D crew keeps feeding fresh upgrades into next-gen plant designs, driving down capital costs.Big Picture ShiftGreen Hydrogen has officially left the R&D lab—it’s runway-ready. With net-zero pressures mounting across iron, steel, ammonia, and petrochemicals,Electrolyzercapacity demand is skyrocketing. Just inEurope MENA, we could see more than 50 GW of capacity needed by 2030, triggering billions in new infrastructure and pipeline projects. Electric Hydrogen’s end-to-end package—cutting-edge PEM stacks,Ingeteampower electronics, and a global delivery team—puts it in a tight group capable of pulling off multi-hundred-megawatt plants on schedule. This ramp-up will ripple through power grids, forcing them to handle two-way energy flows; it’ll need smart water treatment to recycle spent brine; and it’ll spark new hydrogen certification and trading lanes for exports. As carbon pricing and Guarantees of Origin rules firm up, having a proven turnkey solution with a leader likeBruno Forgetin place becomes a standout advantage. Buyers get transparency, competitive pricing, and the peace of mind that comes with a track record.Looking AheadBringingBruno Forgeton board isn’t just another hire—it’s a green light for breakneck growth. With him steering the ship, Electric Hydrogen is primed to power up ports, refineries, and industrial parks from Europe to the Middle East and everything in between. If you’re a policymaker scouting ready-made decarbonization fixes, an investor eyeing exponential returns, or an industrial player in need of dependable hydrogen supply, here’s the deal: Electric Hydrogen’sHYPRPlantis ready to roll, and it’s moving fast.

At the same time, Middle East players are betting big on hydrogen exports and homegrown green-fuel plants to shake up their economies. By roping inBruno Forget, who’s got over two decades in the hydrogen world at Air Liquide, Cummins, and Plug Power, Electric Hydrogen is signaling it’s ready to cut through red tape, grab policy incentives, and nail down giant, multi-hundred-megawatt deals—fast.On-the-Ground ImpactGermany (Wilhelmshaven): Uniper’s Green Wilhelmshaven will host a 200 MWHYPRPlantElectrolyzer, churning out up to 40,000 tonnes of Green Hydrogen a year for industrial and power uses.USA (Texas): Renewable Hydrogen from HYPRPlant units feeds Infinium’s sustainable aviation fuel project, slashing lifecycle emissions on transatlantic flights.Middle East (planned): Partnerships across the GCC aim to tap abundant solar power and desalinated water for gigawatt-scale plants, shipping out hydrogen and ammonia via new pipelines and vessels.These anchor projects prove HYPRPlant can handle anything—from blustery North Sea conditions to blazing Texas sun and arid desert heat. Scaling up also brings huge perks: thousands of new jobs in manufacturing, ops, and maintenance; fresh water treatment and recycling plants to keep theElectrolyzerfeedstock flowing; plus beefed-up ports and pipeline networks that lock in energy security. It’s innovation plus infrastructure—that’s the recipe for a bulletproof hydrogen supply chain.The Fuel Behind the FireAt the heart of everyHYPRPlantsits advanced Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysis tech. It’s up and running in minutes, keeps efficiency high even when renewable inputs wobble, and plays nice across varying loads. Thanks to Electric Hydrogen’s partnership withIngeteam, those 20 MW skids pack top-shelf power electronics and digital controls, tweaking voltage, current, and temperature in real time. The payoff? Over 70% energy conversion efficiency and a potential 20% cut in the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) compared to older systems. And because the setup’s modular, you can service a single unit without killing the whole plant’s uptime.Power Moves Behind the ScenesThis isn’t just about slick tech—it’s about muscle in the market. Electric Hydrogen is lining up green bonds, calling in export credit agencies, and forging alliances with regional engineering partners to fast-track permits, construction, and commissioning. With 300+ staff worldwide, they’re opening local hubs in Frankfurt, Dubai, and Barcelona so they can talk the talk, navigate regional rules, and hit the ground running. Bruno Forget’s history of sealing big deals atAir Liquide,Cummins, andPlug Powerwill be gold when it comes to landing long-term offtake agreements with steel mills, refineries, and chemical plants. They’re also working on hydrogen certification standards and digital tracking to tick all the emerging EU boxes on Guarantees of Origin and carbon pricing. Meanwhile, the Devens R&D crew keeps feeding fresh upgrades into next-gen plant designs, driving down capital costs.Big Picture ShiftGreen Hydrogen has officially left the R&D lab—it’s runway-ready. With net-zero pressures mounting across iron, steel, ammonia, and petrochemicals,Electrolyzercapacity demand is skyrocketing. Just inEurope MENA, we could see more than 50 GW of capacity needed by 2030, triggering billions in new infrastructure and pipeline projects. Electric Hydrogen’s end-to-end package—cutting-edge PEM stacks,Ingeteampower electronics, and a global delivery team—puts it in a tight group capable of pulling off multi-hundred-megawatt plants on schedule. This ramp-up will ripple through power grids, forcing them to handle two-way energy flows; it’ll need smart water treatment to recycle spent brine; and it’ll spark new hydrogen certification and trading lanes for exports. As carbon pricing and Guarantees of Origin rules firm up, having a proven turnkey solution with a leader likeBruno Forgetin place becomes a standout advantage. Buyers get transparency, competitive pricing, and the peace of mind that comes with a track record.Looking AheadBringingBruno Forgeton board isn’t just another hire—it’s a green light for breakneck growth. With him steering the ship, Electric Hydrogen is primed to power up ports, refineries, and industrial parks from Europe to the Middle East and everything in between.

    "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report At theKorea-Serbia Strategic Energy Development Forumin Belgrade, the atmosphere was electric: Serbia’s gearing up for its next big energy milestone. Remember a time when the grid ran on lignite coal and an abundance of hydropower? Those days are giving way to a greener chapter, wherenuclear energyandgreen hydrogentake center stage. On September 2, 2025, two game-changing MOUs were signed between the Serbian Ministry of Mining and Energy andKorea Hydro & Nuclear Power(KHNP), marking a fresh push in Serbia’ssustainable energyroadmap.Leading the charge,Sonja Vlahović, State Secretary at the Ministry, andJoo-ho Whang, President and CEO ofKHNP, put pen to paper. Their signatures lock in collaboration on workforce training, info sharing, and joint pilot projects across nuclear power tech and green hydrogen development. Bottom line: these deals are all about sharpening Serbia’s energy skills, shoring up national security, and slashing greenhouse gas emissions.Nuclear Innovation: Building Expertise and ResilienceThe first MOU dives into nuclear innovation, tappingKHNP’sproven track record—whether that’s massive reactors or nimble Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). Serbia shelved its nuclear dreams after the Yugoslav wars and Chernobyl, but now nuclear’s back as a rock-solid baseload solution. Under this pact,KHNPwill share know-how, roll out customized training for Serbian engineers and regulators, and back joint research with institutions like theVinča Institute for Nuclear Sciences.Serbia’s keeping it flexible, weighing both classic large reactors and modular SMRs. With units from 50 to 300 MW, SMRs let you scale capacity exactly where it’s needed—no overbuilding. This two-pronged approach means that whether Serbia opts for a full-scale station or a network of modular plants, robust safety and regulatory frameworks will be in place within five to seven years.Yes, the upfront tab for those technical studies comes in at roughly€30 million, covering institution building, safety reviews, and workforce training. It’s a sizable investment, but when you stack it against the long-term payoff of stable, low-carbon power—and Europe’s tightening grip on coal—the math starts to look very attractive.Advancing Hydrogen Production and Pilot ProjectsThe second MOU zeroes in ongreen hydrogen, made viaelectrolysispowered by renewables. Serbia’s already testing hydrogen to decarbonize industry and balance the grid, with early work led byElektroprivreda Srbije (EPS). Now, teaming up withKHNP, Serbia will pilot electrolyzers, hook them up to solar and hydro plants, and trial hydrogen storage and distribution chains.Both partners will swap expertise across the full supply chain, aiming to position Serbia as a regional hub forhydrogen production. These demo projects will feed hydrogen into local factories and mobility trials, echoing Europe’s push for robusthydrogen infrastructureand industrial decarbonization.Tech Spotlight: SMRs and ElectrolysisSMRspack nuclear fission into compact modules, making financing and siting a breeze compared to gigawatt-scale plants. You can deploy them bit by bit, matching demand without overkill. Meanwhile,electrolysissplits water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable juice—creating zero-emission fuel. Pair electrolyzers with solar or hydro, and you smooth out generation swings, store extra energy, and either send hydrogen into industrial processes or feed it into the gas grid for heat and transport.From Coal Reliance to Low-Carbon AmbitionsFor decades, Serbia’s energy story was written in lignite and Danube-fed dams. But aging plants, EU carbon targets, and volatile coal markets have laid bare the risks of that model. Reinventing the grid means pairing reliable baseload—where nuclear shines—with renewables backed by hydrogen buffering.International partnerships have been key to Serbia’s strategy. French, Russian, Chinese, and US firms have all pitched in studies. Now, South Korea is stepping up as a strategic ally. Through theKorea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA), Korean heavyweights likeHyundai Engineeringhave already kicked off Serbia’s largest solar-plus-storage project, proving these ties run deep.Strategic Impact and Next StepsThese MOUs deliver a stack of wins. First, they fast-track workforce upskilling in cutting-edge energy tech. Second, they open doors to foreign direct investment, driving economic modernization and stronger Serbia–South Korea ties. Third, they diversify Serbia’s energy partnerships beyond old-school allies, boosting resilience against supply shocks.On the ground, entities likeElektroprivreda Srbijeand theVinča Instituteare already lining up pilot zones—think repurposed coal sites and industrial parks—where hydrogen plants and SMR modules can co-locate. That cuts infrastructure costs and breathes new life into coal-dependent communities.Sure, hurdles remain—public acceptance of nuclear power, long-term radioactive waste handling, and project financing. But partnering with a seasoned player likeKHNPavoids many geopolitical headaches and technical roadblocks. Now, dedicated working groups will refine technical roadmaps, nail down funding, and close regulatory gaps to turn these agreements into operational reactors and electrolyzers.In many ways, Serbia’s dual push ongreen hydrogenand nuclear mirrors a global shift—nations tappinghydrogen productionto decarbonize while keeping reliable baseload from nuclear. If these projects gain traction, Serbia could become a poster child for energy diversification, showing how a coal-dependent country can transition to a zero-emission world.

You can deploy them bit by bit, matching demand without overkill. Meanwhile,electrolysissplits water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable juice—creating zero-emission fuel. Pair electrolyzers with solar or hydro, and you smooth out generation swings, store extra energy, and either send hydrogen into industrial processes or feed it into the gas grid for heat and transport.From Coal Reliance to Low-Carbon AmbitionsFor decades, Serbia’s energy story was written in lignite and Danube-fed dams.

Hard to believe, right? Yet come September 2025,Extreme H, the world’s first pure hydrogen-powered off-road racing series, will roar into Saudi Arabia, completely rewriting what we thought was possible in sustainable energy and high-speed motorsport.From Extreme E’s Electric Spark to Hydrogen’s High-Octane PotentialRemember whenExtreme Esent electric SUVs into remote, climate-impacted corners of the world? It was eye-opening for zero-emission tech, but charging in the middle of nowhere was a major headache. That’s wheregreen hydrogencomes in. By running electrolysis on solar and wind power, teams can pull off a full tank swap in minutes instead of hours. The custom-builtPioneer 25pairs a 400 kW Symbio fuel cell stack with Fortescue ZERO batteries, feeding instant torque to dual electric motors and leaving only H₂O in its wake.Saudi Arabia’s Green Hydrogen GambitWhy choose Saudi Arabia? Under Vision 2030, the kingdom is plowing billions into renewables andgreen hydrogeninfrastructure. Backed by theSaudi Public Investment Fund (PIF)and giga-projectNEOM, they’re mapping out a desert-scale supply chain—from giant electrolyzers to high-pressure refueling stations. Tacking a week-long, World Cup–style race onto this grand plan isn’t just about spectators: it’s a statement that Saudi wants to be a global hub for hydrogen production and sustainable energy.FIA’s Green Flag for Hydrogen RacingWhen theFédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA)waved the green flag on Extreme H, it marked their first pure hydrogen series—slotting it right alongside Formula 1 and the World Rally Championship. That FIA nod is a magnet for sponsors, investors, and top-tier drivers eager to back cutting-edgefuel cell technology. Thanks to entrepreneurAlejandro Agagshepherding talks with Saudi powers and the FIA, a specialized working group is hammering out safety measures—from tank integrity tests to emergency-response playbooks—that could set the standard for hydrogen fuel cells everywhere.More Than a Race: Data, Skills, and Policy MomentumExtreme H isn’t just a spectacle; it’s a rolling laboratory. Drivers push fuel cell stacks hard—battling heat, dust, and altitude. Engineers collect precious data on membrane life, thermal management, and refueling speed, feeding insights back into broader hydrogen production and vehicle projects. Pit crews learn to swap out tanks faster than the old battery modules ever saw, building hands-on expertise that’s critical to scaling up a full-fledged hydrogen infrastructure economy.The Road Ahead: Scaling a Hydrogen EcosystemOf course, hurdles remain. Electrolyzers gulp massive amounts of renewable power, fresh water sources need careful stewardship, and high-pressure storage demands bulletproof safety protocols. But motorsport has a knack for fast-tracking breakthroughs—just look at the birth of carbon fiber or disc brakes. If Extreme H proves hydrogen’s reliability under the harshest conditions, economies of scale could kick in, driving costs down and opening doors for hydrogen fuel cells in trucking, buses, and even aviation.Final Lap: A Preview of 2026 and BeyondAs thePioneer 25carves fresh ruts in the Saudi sands, the ripple effects could be enormous. A smashing debut might lead to new races in Europe’s green hydrogen valleys or North American deserts—each stop adding more data, infrastructure, and investor confidence.

    "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report TheDaures Green Hydrogen Villagein Namibia is rewriting the playbook onsustainable energyin Africa. Touted asAfrica’s first net zero village, it’s kicking off a pilot in October 2024 that’s expected to churn out around 18 tonnes ofgreen hydrogenand 100 tonnes ofclean ammoniaeach year. With global net zero deadlines breathing down governments’ necks, being able to capture sunlight and wind to whip up fertilizer-grade chemicals right on the spot is a total game-changer. But beyond the eye-catching numbers, this venture aims to flip the script for remote communities, turning them into self-sufficient hubs of energy production, supplyingzero-carbon fertilizerto local farms, and kickstarting a fresh wave of socio-economic growth.Context and AmbitionSet against the rugged backdrop of theErongo regionnear Uis, the Daures site sprawls across 15,000 hectares, with 300 hectares earmarked for the pilot stage. Namibia’s fertilizer import bills have long been a headache—sub-Saharan Africa applies just 15% of the rates recommended by the FAO. By tapping into its world-class solar irradiance and breezy wind corridors, theNamibian Governmentlaunched this project in 2023 as part of a bigger push to diversify the economy, boost energy independence, and pave the way for industrial decarbonization.While similargreen hydrogenschemes are popping up in Egypt, Morocco, and Mauritania, Daures stands out by weaving local agriculture and training into the mix from day one. Engineering consultants fromFichtner GmbHhandled both pre-feasibility and detailed feasibility studies, and theUniversity of Namibiastepped in for research partnerships, field trials, and student training. Under CEOJerome Namaseb’s leadership, this project is as much a living lab as it is an industrial plant—a real-world demo of how modern energy solutions can spark regional change.The global buzz aroundhydrogen fuel cellsandclean ammonia, coupled with maturing carbon markets and fresh policy incentives, means the pilot is stepping into the spotlight right when industrial players are hankering for low-carbon pathways.Deep Dive into TechnologyThe magic kicks off with fields ofphotovoltaic panelsandwind turbinesfeeding juice toelectrolyzersthat split water—from seven local boreholes—into hydrogen and oxygen. Thishydrogen productionprocess createsgreen hydrogen, which then feeds a renewable-poweredHaber–Bosch reactorto churn outclean ammonia. By co-locating with acopper smelter, the sulfuric acid byproduct gets a second life, reacting with green ammonia on-site to makeammonium sulfate fertilizer—skipping out on shipping emissions and fossil-based feedstocks.Smartautomationkeeps everything humming: sensors track pressure and temperature in real time, while control algorithms tweak catalyst performance on the fly. Excess heat from electrolysis gets captured to warm the greenhouses, and process water loops back through the system, epitomizingzero-emission technology.On the agricultural front,hydroponic greenhousesshowcase how those ammonia-derived nutrients can grow veggies year-round under LED lights and climate controls—turning desert dust into a veritable oasis of sustainable farming.Community Impact and Skills TrainingCommunity engagement is at the heart of Daures. With backing fromUNIDO’s Accelerate-to-Demonstrate Facility, the village will host hands-on workshops for around 250–300 Namibians. Trainees cycle through modules on electrolyzer upkeep, ammonia synthesis, fertilizer blending, greenhouse operations, and lab analytics—with priority spots for youth and marginalized groups.On the procurement side, at least 30% of pilot contracts are set aside for local SMEs—from builders to service providers—so the cash flows right back into the region. Early social impact assessments predict a 10–15% uptick in household incomes as new jobs, apprenticeships, and entrepreneurial ventures blossom. AsJerome Namasebputs it, “We’re weaving a value chain that starts with electrons and ends at dinner tables.”Economic and Export StrategyInitially, the project will supply local farmers with affordable ammonium sulfate fertilizer, but the bigger picture is global. Thanks to its proximity toWalvis Bay portand Namibia’s nascent green hydrogen export roadmap, Daures is poised for a commercial scale-up in 2027—following the ground-breaking for an expanded ammonia sulfate facility slated for September 2025.Beyond Europe, neighboring markets like South Africa, Botswana, and Zambia could slash import bills by tapping into locally made fertilizer. With demand forclean ammoniasurging—spurred by decarbonization targets in agriculture, shipping, and power generation—and Europe’scarbon border adjustment mechanismlooming, Namibian exports are sitting pretty.Financially, the project’s phased investment rounds tie funding to construction and performance milestones, keeping risks in check. Its off-grid design sidesteps strain on Namibia’s aging grid, letting capacity scale up swiftly—a blueprint for other regions wrestling with infrastructure bottlenecks.Risks and Future PerspectiveScaling from demo-scale electrolysis to multi-megawatt operations won’t be a walk in the park—it’ll test supply chains and technical resilience. Water management is another tightrope act, as borehole use needs to stay sustainable to protect aquifers. Plus, fertilizer prices and carbon credit markets can be fickle, which might sway the project’s bottom line.Still, with a mix of national policy backing, UNIDO grants, and German clean energy partners, there are solid guardrails in place. As performance data rolls in, design tweaks will fine-tune operations and pave the way for bigger rollouts. If the pilot hits its 2024–2027 marks, Namibia could unlock gigawatt-scalehydrogen productioncapacity, kickstarting a continental shift toward carbon-neutral industry.Looking AheadTheDaures Green Hydrogen Villagepaints a big-picture vision—fromgreen hydrogenproduction to fertilizer, from community training to export markets. As the pilot fires up this October, it’s more than just a local success story—it’s a blueprint for how remote, resource-rich areas can leapfrog old-school industrial models and chart a course to sustainable prosperity. In the sands of Erongo, a global green revolution is taking root, and its demo could reshape policies and spur investments all across southern Africa, lighting the way for a fresh wave of low-carbon industrial parks.Spread the love Set against the rugged backdrop of theErongo regionnear Uis, the Daures site sprawls across 15,000 hectares, with 300 hectares earmarked for the pilot stage.

    "full_text": "Finland-based Lumon has integrated balcony PV modules into a glass parapet, maintaining the facade’s appearance without visible technical components. The first project using the product has already been completed in Finland. Balcony modules for parapet installation are already well known. Finnish glazing specialist Lumon is taking a step further. With its eRailing system, the glass parapet itself becomes a PV system. The solution transforms the glass wall, attached to the balcony as fall protection, into a power generator. According to the manufacturer, the PV modules are integrated almost invisibly between two panes of glass. Cables and connections are concealed beneath a cover in the handrail. This creates an aesthetically pleasing solution with no visible technical components. Lumon aims to use this argument to appeal to architects and planners. The system meets current standards for structural stability, wind loads and safety, according to the company, and is as stable as conventional balcony glazing, parapets and railings. Parapet elements can be combined to create different balcony dimensions. Further design options are available in black and gray. In Finland, eRailing was used for the first time in a building renovation. A six-meter-long element with an optimal southerly orientation and northern European conditions should generate about 622 kWh of solar power per year, according to the manufacturer. This corresponds to a module output of about 800 W to 900 W. The solution does not include an inverter, which must be provided separately by the builder.

    "full_text": "The sixth phase of work at the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, set to add 1.8 GW of solar to the site, is more than two thirds complete with 1 GW now in operation. Image: Government of Dubai Media Office A further 1 GW of solar is operational at the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, the world’s largest single-site solar park, located in theUnited Arab Emirates. Work is currently underway on thesixth phaseof the project that will add a total of 1.8 GW of solar to the site, which is being implemented by Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) under an independent power producer (IPP) model. An update published by the government of Dubai confirms the sixth phase is approximately 68.59% complete, having reached the 1 GW threshold, with the remaining 800 MW under construction. Over 2.2 million solar panels have been installed to date, with the number on track to reach over 3.9 million by the time the current phase of work is completed next year. To date, the solar park’s cumulative production capacity stands at over3.8 GW,according to figures published by DEWA. By the end of the decade, its capacity is expected to reach over 7.2 GW, exceeding the original 5 GW target, and will contribute to around 34% of Dubai’s total electricity capacity. In February, DEWA issued a call for developers to assist with theseventh phaseof the project on an IPP basis. The tendered solar facility will have a capacity ranging between 1.6 GW and 2 GW and will be connected to 1 GW of battery capacity, making it one of the largest solar-plus-storage projects in the world. In April, DEWA Managing Director and CEO Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer announced that47 global companieshad expressed interest in developing the next phase.

    "full_text": "Bangladesh has canceled 5.68 GW of planned solar capacity across 34 projects after developers failed to secure implementation, power purchase or land lease agreements, raising investor concerns over policy stability. Image: Aboodi Vesakaran, Unsplash The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) has scrapped approvals for 34 solar power plants for which letters of intent (LoIs) were issued under the Special Provisions Act. The LoIs are being canceled because no implementation agreements, power purchase agreements (PPA), or land lease agreements have been signed, said the BPDB. The canceled projects, supported by local and foreign investors, were expected to have a combined capacity of 5,681 MW. The LoIs were issued under the Quick Enhancement of Electricity and Energy Supply (Special Provisions) Act without competitive bidding during the previous government. After taking office, the current government in August 2024 suspended all negotiations, project selection, and procurement processes under the Special Provisions Act, citing widespread irregularities in awarding plant approvals, including tariff fixation. This July, the government published an ordinance repealing the Special Provisions Act and decided not to authorize any more power plants under it. Future procedures for the canceled plants must follow an open tender process. The renewable energy sector said the government’s cancellation of so many solar approvals sends “wrong signals” to foreign investors in particular. “Foreign investors will now rethink while making any investment plan in Bangladesh due to uncertainty of policy sustainability in the country,” said Mostafa Al Mahmud, president of the Bangladesh Sustainable and Renewable Energy Association (BSREA). He said entrepreneurs have already invested about $300 million in these projects.“We had requested several times to reconsider the decision, but the government did not respond,” he toldpv magazine.

The approvals conclude the fifth bidding round of the country’s large-scale solar programme, which opened for applicationsin January. Aiming to procure 2 GW, the bidding round received 37 applications across two bid packages for a total capacity in excess of 4 GW, according to a statement published by Malaysia’s Ministry of Energy Transition and Water Transformation (Petra). Petra says the 13 selected bidders complied with all the requirements set out in the request for proposals.The approved capacity during the scheme's fifth round is the largest agreed on since the LSS program was implemented in 2016. The scheme has now approved 4,263 MW of large-scale solar projects in total. The ministry added that the newly-approved projects will begin generating electricity in 2027 and 2028. Among the projects is a 200 MW floating solar array, one of Malaysia’s largest to date, PETRA says. Further individual project details are yet to be disclosed. Malaysia’s cumulative solar capacity reached 2,306 MW by the end of 2024, up from 2,146 MW at the end of 2023, according to statistics published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The country has set a target of achieving a 40% renewable energy share in its national energy mix by 2040. Last month, subsidiaries belonging to Malaysian companies Gentari and Gamuda revealed plans to develop1.5 GW of solartied to battery energy storage to supply hyperscale data centers located in Malaysia.

In a challenging year for large, distributed solar generation projects – between 1 MW and 5 MW in scale and often developed in clusters – and for centralized photovoltaic plants, inverter supplier Sungrow experienced a decline in orders. That has been balanced by new business for Sungrow’s storage products, including pre-agreements for the LRCAP capacity reserve auction for batteries. An extension of the deadline for centralized generation sites to begin commercial operation – with associated incentives protected – has also generated new business for Sungrow but the inverter maker expects 2 GW of equipment sales for centralized generation this year, down from almost 3 GW last year, according to Brazil Country Manager Rafael Ribeiro.

Image: Benjamin Jopen, Unsplash China's Kibing Group has met with the Algerian Ministry of Energy to discuss beginning production ofsolar glassinAlgeria. According to a statement from the Algerian Press Service, the two parties met last week to allow the Chinese glass manufacturer to present an investment proposal for the project. The project would encompass the construction of a solar glass production plant with an annual capacity of 1.53 million tonnes, alongside an ultrapure silica sand processing and recovery unit with an annual capacity of 1.08 million tonnes.The Chinese delegation told ministers the project would create 3,000 direct jobs with a local integration rate reaching 90%. The two parties also discussed the construction of an integrated production chain in Algeria’s solar energy sector to strengthen the country’s position as a regional hub for the Middle East and North Africa region, according to officials. They then agreed to form joint working groups to study the solar glass project’s feasibility, financing and implementation. Kibing’s proposal is part of the group’s wider plans to expand its solar glass manufacturing presence in North Africa. Last month, Egypt’s State Information Service reported the company plans to build a solar glass plant valued at $685 million within the Sokhna Integrated Zone. Earlier this year, the Algerian ministrymet with a delegationfrom Chinese module maker Longi to discuss the country’s domestic solar market, including plans for a solar manufacturing facility. Algeria reissued atenderfor three solar projects totaling 520 MW in January. According to figures published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the country had a cumulative solar capacity of 462 MW at the end of last year, unchanged from the year prior.

    "full_text": "Canadian and U.S. researchers have investigated applying pressure to a 2D hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite to tune the optical and electronic properties to suit photovoltaic applications, light emitting diodes or other semiconductor devices. PL measurements of DPDAPbI4 at high pressure Image: University of Western Ontario, Advanced Optical Materials, Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 Two-dimensional (2D)Dion-Jacobson (DJ) phase perovskiteshave sparked interest in the scientific community due to their stability against harsh environmental conditions and their competitive performance in optoelectronic applications. Solar cells based on DJ perovskites, however, have shown comparatively poor performance compared to their 3D counterparts. With this in mind, Researchers from the US and Canada, led by a team from Canada’sUniversity of Western Ontarioused diamond anvil cell (DAC) technology to apply pressure to 2D Dion-Jacobson hybrid lead iodide perovskite material, known as DPDAPbI4, to investigate how to improve their potential for photovoltaic and other semiconductor applications. The study involved measuring the structural origins and mechanisms of phase transition and optoelectronic tuning of the hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite (HOIP) material, which revealed “unexpected octahedral distortions under compression,” which was different from previous lead-based 2D material studies. The work involved a “unique and neat physical” method of compression, or squeezing, to finetune the chemical structures, according to Yang Song, corresponding author of the research, explaining that the aim was to alter optical and electronic properties of the materials in order to tune performance for practical applications, such as photovoltaics. “We found that under compression, the crystal lattice undergoes unusual distortion that influences the photoluminescence quantum yield, with more than two-fold enhancement. The bandgap energy, a critical parameter for semiconducting materials used in photovoltaics, exhibits a prominent pressure-induced reduction, a desirable behavior potentially for better performance in photovoltaic devices,” Song toldpv magazine. The details of the research, which required using the Canadian Light Source and the Advanced Photon Source at the U.S.-basedArgonne National Laboratory, were published in the paper “Pressure-Induced Structural and Optoelectronic Modulations in 2D Dion-Jacobson Hybrid Lead Iodide Perovskites With a Rigid Spacer,” published inAdvanced Optical Materials. The team examined the high-pressure behavior of a Dion-Jacobson type 2D HOIP, DPDAPbI4, which incorporates the rigid organic spacer N,N-dimethylphenylene-p-diammonium (DPDA). The 2D HOIPs are seen as having superior chemical and thermal stability compared to 3D perovskite counterparts for use as light absorbers, hole transport layers, or passivation layers, according to the researchers. The team said that the work provides “new insights into the design” of DJ-type 2D HOIPs with rigid organic spacers, paving the way for materials with tunable optical properties. “They are relatively easy to fabricate through solution processes like spin-coating,” said Song. To determine the behavior under pressure, the team used UV–visible absorption, vibrational spectroscopy, and in situ synchrotron powder X-ray diﬀraction, a continuous wave diode-pumped solid-state laser equipped with a beam splitter, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, in addition to the light sources mentioned above. For the high-pressure photoluminescence (PL) sample measurements, the DPDAPbI4 crystals were loaded into a diamond anvil cell (DAC) with type II diamonds with 600 µm diameter culets or facets. A diamond anvil cell (DAC) is a research apparatus that can apply static high pressures, up to several million atmospheres. The research team included scientists from theNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, both based in the United States. The researchers are now working on similar research with another type of 2D perovskite that does not contain lead (Pb). “We are exploring Sn (tin) based 2D perovskites to evaluate their optoelectronic properties under high pressure in comparison with the Pb counterpart,” said Song.

    "full_text": "An Australian state parliamentary report says residents near the Central-West Orana renewable energy zone in New South Wales face negative social and economic impacts, despite a AUD 128 million ($83 million) community benefit program. The New South Wales legislative council’s first report on the impact of renewable energy zones on rural and regional communities found that residents near the Central-West Orana renewable energy zone (CWO REZ) have been negatively affected. The CWO REZ spans about 20,000 square km, covering the communities of Mudgee, Dubbo, Dunedoo and surrounding towns and villages located 330 to 400 km northwest of Sydney. The report, titled “The Impact of Renewable Energy Zones on Rural and Regional Communities and Industries in New South Wales: First Report,” makes recommendations to address the impacts in the CWO REZ region. Chaired by Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party member of the legislative council Mark Banasiak, the committee issued five recommendations, finding that “a significant proportion of the Central-West Orana community believe the CWO REZ has negatively impacted the region.” This conclusion comes despite a New South Wales government commitment of AUD 128 million (USD 83 million) to the CWO REZ community benefit program, which includes AUD 15 million for a community fund, AUD 500,000 in small grants, AUD 10 million for a First Nations fund, and AUD 2.9 million for the Renewable Energy Skills Legacy Program to boost the regional energy workforce. The report said uncertainty over project development approvals is causing concern in communities, with repercussions from inadequate consultation between the government, renewable developers and the CWO community “eroding social cohesion and undermining the social license of renewable energy operators in the region.” The government has granted CWO REZ access rights to 10 renewable energy projects with a combined capacity of 7.7 GW of renewable energy and storage. Projects include the Lightsource bp Sandy Creek and Pacific Partnerships Cobbora solar farms and batteries. The ACEREZ consortium is building new transmission lines and infrastructure, while Tilt Renewables’ Liverpool Range Wind Farm, ACEN’s Birriwa Solar and battery energy storage system, and Squadron Energy’s Spicers Creek Wind Farm are approved and advancing. The report also said communities are concerned about local agricultural industries, calling on the government to monitor impacts and address public liability insurance for properties adjacent to developments. It further found that the CWO REZ has created significant challenges for local councils. The report recommends an independent cumulative impact study, that EnergyCo provide mental health support to affected landowners, a review of the use of social impact assessments, and that payments for land acquisitions not be taxed. The final recommendation calls on the New South Wales government to identify ecological protection and restoration priorities for each of the state’s renewable energy zones and to encourage developers to contribute to regional environmental outcomes.

    "full_text": "The American public has shown a strong willingness to fund solar and other renewable energy projects through tax credits, largely because voters trust directed infrastructure funding more than open-ended government revenue pools. Image: Andres Siimon, Unsplash, CC SA 4.0 Solar tax incentives are not incentives, at least not in the traditional sense. They are politically palatable carbon pricing. More than that, Americans increasingly view them not as subsidies but as civic responsibility and asound investment. For decades, fossil fuel-aligned politicians have sought to brand carbon pollution pricing as a “carbon tax,” a term carefully chosen to make a practical, market-friendly policy politically toxic. Philosophically, Americans are against taxation. We bristle at the word “tax.” After all, “no taxation without representation” is a foundational rallying cry. The phrase “carbon tax” lands poorly because it evokes images of politicians digging a new tunnel into our collective pockets. Even amongsupporters of carbon legislation, there’s often discomfort with handing elected officials a blank check. And yet, most Americans recognize that emissions are pollution, and pollution carries a cost. We’re surprisingly willing to pay a bit more for a better product (cleaner energy) and we’ll even accept added fees on electricity bills when we know those dollars are building visible infrastructure. Americans don’t just say that they like solar, they back it with their wallets. Favorability polls put solarright up there with apple pie, and the numbers support it. There are more thanfive million US solar installationsonline, most of them residential. The US solar fleet exceeds 200 GW and is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. If we’re going to pay what amounts to a carbon tax, Americans have made it clear: they want those dollars tied directly to real hardware. A 2017Yale University pollfound that US households were willing to pay up to $177 more per year on electricity bills for cleaner energy. When asked how they’d like that money spent, nearly 80% favored wind and solar development, while 77% supported infrastructure upgrades like roads and bridges. As with the apple pie data, solar’s favorability rating,consistentlyabove 80%, dwarfs that of even the most popular politicians: Obama, Schwarzenegger, Harris, and Sanderstop out between 50% and 61%, still far behind solar. That popularity is also why Trump, who recently called solar and wind the“scam of the year,”was never able to eliminate the tax credits. There’s precedent for this kind of political durability. In Europe,wind and solar grewunder public incentive programs that rewarded early adopters, especially in the wake of repeated global energy crises. The reason for the social acceptance is simple: the cycle works. Distributed generation brings distributed benefits – jobs, bill savings, rooftop revenue—all funded by distributed responsibility. The $177 yearly figure becomes a civic baseline. Still, fossil-fueled media voices claim that wind and solar have “outlived” their incentives. The narrative doesn’t hold. These supports are not giveaways. They’re obligations. Because fossil interests delayed climate action for decades, the United States forfeited its first-mover advantage and the luxury of a smooth transition under purer market principles. America has lollygagged since the 1980s, sedated by 40 years of propaganda, even as climate science grew clearer and more urgent. The bill is now due: to meet our 2050 climate targets, we must compress 40 years of inaction into just 25 years of decisive effort. And the slope towards a stable biosphere keeps steepening. As science raised its voice, so did its opposition. The propaganda didn’t fade, it evolved. It’s louder now, more sophisticated, and deeply embedded in the culture wars that drown out facts with outrage. Yet even in this moment, broad support for solar and storage has helped launch a genuine energy revolution. Tax credits aren’t energy welfare. They’re the cost of delay. They’re a down payment on civic responsibility, deferred by misinformation, regulatory capture, and legislative gridlock. They’re the uncomfortable byproduct of a disrupted transition, and the price of playing catch-up in an emergency. There’s no elegant way to undo decades of inaction, and we’re out of time for purity tests. We must embrace risk. Some things will break. Others will work. Disruption is the price of transformation. Compared to the cost of doing nothing, it’s a bargain. This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

    "full_text": "Turning challenges into opportunities as the U.S. solar and storage sectors enter a phase of major policy and market realignment. The U.S. solar PV and storage sectors are entering a phase of major policy and market realignment. The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB), together with proposed tariffs on foreign components and systems, is reshaping incentives, investment flows, and supply chains across both technologies. While these measures are designed to strengthen domestic manufacturing and reduce exposure to foreign entities of concern (FEOC), they also introduce new challenges for manufacturers, developers, investors, and utilities. Understanding how these shifts affect profitability, demand, and regional dynamics is essential for stakeholders seeking to navigate near-term uncertainties and position themselves for long-term growth in the clean energy transition. Market impact: Solar PV and storage under OBBB The OBBB marks a turning point in the economics of U.S. clean energy, reshaping the fundamentals of both solar PV and storage. While solar faces tightening margins and policy-driven uncertainty, battery storage continues to show resilience, offering stakeholders a clearer path to near-term profitability. For solar PV, the numbers tell a sobering story. According to EUPD Research analysis, internal rates of return (IRR) for residential, commercial & Industrial (C&I), and utility-scale projects decline by 4% to 7% under OBBB, reflecting the phaseout of tax credits and rising compliance costs, particularly when projects rely on domestic modules. Yet the picture is not uniformly bleak. States with higher retail electricity prices such as California, Massachusetts, and Maine still deliver profitable returns, particularly in the C&I segment, which remains comparatively strong even as residential systems lose some appeal. Battery storage paints a contrasting picture. Even after applying conservative assumptions and excluding tax credits that could be lost under FEOC rules, both C&I and utility-scale storage projects continue to deliver attractive IRRs of 14% to 18%. With growing demand for grid flexibility and backup capacity, storage is emerging as the stabilizer in an otherwise unsettled market. The tariff environment further complicates the economics of solar PV deployment. Proposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on modules from Southeast Asian nations could sharply raise system costs, with average module tariffs projected to approach 800%, though the exact levels vary widely by country. While around 83% of U.S. solar PV module imports between January and June 2025 originated from this region, the absolute volume was only about 15 GW, compared to 49 GW imported over the full year in 2024. Even at these lower volumes, the potential upward pressure on costs could significantly affect both residential and utility-scale projects, further squeezing already tightening returns. On both solar and storage, FEOC restrictions loom large. If domestic manufacturers lose access to Section 45X manufacturing tax credits under the IRA, costs are expected to rise by roughly US$0.07 per watt for solar modules and US$10 per kilowatt-hour for battery modules. These amounts correspond to the incentives currently provided through the IRA, and losing them would directly increase system costs. While such increases are not expected to drastically alter profitability, they add to developers’ and investors’ uncertainty. The immediate demand outlook reflects ongoing policy transitions. Solar PV capacity additions are projected at 53–56 GWdc in 2025, with growth potentially extending into 2026 and 2027 as developers accelerate projects ahead of tax credit phaseouts for C&I and utility-scale systems. At the same time, an uncertain regulatory environment and the risk of project cancellations could temper this momentum. If cancellations occur, demand could weaken as early as 2026. Manufacturing and supply chain realignments If the OBBB is reshaping project economics on the demand side, its true force may be felt upstream in manufacturing and supply chains. The combination of FEOC restrictions and proposed tariffs is not only changing who can participate in the U.S. market, but also creating ripple effects far beyond its borders. As per EUPD Research analysis, roughly 17 GW of Chinese-affiliated solar PV module manufacturing capacity in the U.S. is now at risk of disqualification under OBBB’s FEOC rules. The U.S. had about 24 GW in total, of which around 7 GW has already been sold to U.S.-based firms. The remaining capacity faces an uncertain future. Unless these assets change hands, they may be shut out of federal incentives or forced to shut down entirely. For investors, the question is whether these facilities can be quickly restructured to comply or whether they represent stranded capacity in a tightening market. Beyond ownership, the U.S. faces more fundamental bottlenecks. While module assembly capacity has grown, the country still lacks large-scale production of critical upstream components such as ingots, wafers, and cells. For storage, the gaps are equally pressing: cathode and anode active materials remain heavily dependent on imports from China. Under OBBB’s domestic content tests, these gaps mean many products could fail to qualify for tax credits, even if final assembly occurs on U.S. soil. Bridging these weaknesses will require sustained investment in upstream capacity, something that cannot be achieved overnight. In response, manufacturers and policymakers are exploring new strategies. One option is nearshoring, building capacity in allied countries with stronger trade ties to the U.S. Joint ventures with non-FEOC jurisdictions are also being discussed, offering a pathway to reduce Chinese exposure while diversifying risk. These partnerships may allow manufacturers to maintain access to U.S. incentives while securing more stable component supplies. Given potential future regulatory volatility, it is difficult to project the intrinsic risks with certainty. Why stakeholders should engage now The shifting U.S. policy landscape demands immediate attention from all stakeholders in the solar and storage ecosystem. OBBB provisions, proposed tariffs, and FEOC restrictions are not abstract policy debates, they directly influence investment returns, project pipelines, and supply chain stability. Against this backdrop, stakeholders must act decisively in four key areas: Stakeholders who move early will be better positioned to mitigate risks and seize emerging opportunities as the market resets. A good step in this direction is to engage in forums that bring together developers, investors, and policymakers to discuss strategies. Industry forums such as the upcomingSolar – Made in the USA Conference at RE+provide a vital platform to address these questions collectively and to build the partnerships required for long-term competitiveness. The OBBB and proposed tariffs represent a double-edged shift for the U.S. clean energy sector. In the near term, they are already raising system costs, constraining imports, and amplifying uncertainty around project economics. While they could eventually support a stronger domestic clean energy base by reducing supply chain vulnerabilities and stimulating local manufacturing, returns are tightening across the value chain. PV power plant investors in particular are recording lower IRRs compared with international benchmarks, highlighting the financial headwinds the sector must navigate during this transition. The challenge for stakeholders is to bridge this transition: to weather short-term disruption while preparing for the opportunities of a more self-sufficient market. Strategic positioning before OBBB fully takes effect will be critical, and success will depend on proactive collaboration across industry players, investors, and policymakers. Markus A.W.

    "full_text": "The new coverage will provide up to $20 million in additional expanded capacity, covering damage from severe storms in non-coastal regions. Climate insurance provider kWh Analytics expanded its coverage, adding a new Excess Natural Catastrophe insurance policy for solar projects. The Excess Natural Catastrophe layer provides up to $20 million in additional capacity, covering severe convective storms and named windstorms in non-coastal regions. The company said its loss database shows that hail accounts for 73% of total solar industry losses by damage amount. Technical due diligence and risk mitigation service provider VDE said industry hail damage insurance claims represent only 2% of all claims filed but compriseover 50% of the total costs. The coverage is intended to provide higher insurance limits for catastrophic events like hail or wind damage. “As renewable projects grow in size and tax-equity investors and lenders require higher insurance limits, we’re addressing a critical market gap with this specialized excess layer solution,” said Jason Kaminsky, chief executive officer, kWh Analytics. kWh Analytics approach to underwriting focuses on rewarding projects that invest in resilience. Projects that implement protective measures such as hail stow capabilities, reinforced module characteristics including glass thickness, and O&M protocols benefit from better terms. VDE said insurance claims for utility-scale solar projects damaged by hail average roughly $58 million per claim. However, there are many ways to invest in the resilience of a solar project. To provide a standardized framework for evaluating hail resilience and offer insurance credit for protective measures, kWh Analytics and VDE Americas developed theHail Stow and Risk Evaluationtool. This assessment examines important factors, including panel specifications, tracker stow angles, forecasting systems and testing protocols. Projects demonstrating hail-defense strategies through this evaluation can secure more favorable terms, even in the excess layer, said kWh Analytics. “Resilience should be rewarded at every level of coverage,” said Isaac McLean, chief underwriting officer at kWh Analytics. “Our Excess Natural Catastrophe offering evaluates the same resilience factors we consider in primary coverage, and we request asset owners and sponsors provide us details of their hardening strategies so we can appropriately credit their risk mitigation efforts.” This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

The Spectrum Solar Power Project in Clark County, Nevada- Image: formulanone, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 2.0 The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) released its Procurement Analysis Tool (PAT), a web-based tool designed to help energy buyers navigate off-site procurement options. Backed by NREL data and analysis tools, PAT helps public and private energy buyers to explore off-site electricity options with cost-informed insights tailored to their specific goals. The tool assists with: NREL said following a beta release in 2022, over 180 early adopters are using PAT to inform energy procurement decisions. The tool is intended for use by commercial and industrial buyers, local governments and entities, colleges, universities and campuses, electric service providers, and regulators and public utility commissions. “Our goal with PAT is to make it easy for organizations to understand their options—whether they’re new to the process or have years of experience,” said NREL analyst Jeff Cook, who co-led the development of the tool. “Its easy-to-use interface walks users through a series of questions and identifies actionable, cost-informed energy procurement strategies that reflect their operational needs and priorities.” “While a variety of mature tools are available for analyzing on-site energy options, there are very few tools available to evaluate off-site procurement options,” said NREL analyst Sushmita Jena, who co-led the development of the tool. “We built PAT not only to fill this gap but also to be as user-friendly as possible—ensuring it’s easy to understand and navigate.” PAT integrates several of NREL’s datasets and modeling platforms, including theAnnual Technology Baseline,Renewable Energy Supply Curves,Cambium, and theSystem Advisor Model.

India added 2.8 GW of rooftop solar in the first half of 2025, a 155% increase from 1.1 GW a year earlier, according to Mercom India’s “Q2 2025 Rooftop Solar Market Report.” Of the total, 1.6 GW was installed in the second quarter, up 119% from 731 MW in the second quarter of 2024. Mercom said growth was driven by cleared registration backlogs, the commissioning of new systems, and upgrades to the PM Surya Ghar portal. In Q2 2025, rooftop solar capacity additions were led by the residential segment, which contributed over 74%. This was followed by the industrial segment at over 19%, the commercial segment at about 6%, and the government segment at nearly 0.5%. Installations under the capital expenditure model contributed 88% of the quarterly additions, while capacity additions under the operational expenditure or renewable energy service company model accounted for about 12% of the installations in Q2 2025. “The rooftop solar market is on track for record growth this year, with residential adoption under the PM Surya Ghar program driving nearly three-quarters of new installations. However, persistent DCR module shortages, regulatory unpredictability in some states, net metering and payment issues, threaten to slow this momentum unless addressed quickly. Policy clarity and reliable supply will be critical to sustaining growth at these levels,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, and Rajasthan led the rooftop solar capacity addition during the quarter by contributing 64% of the total installations.

    "full_text": "A paper by King’s College London scientists suggests that space-based solar panels (SBSP) could cut Europe’s land-based renewable energy needs by up to 80%, including reducing battery energy storage usage by more than 70%. The authors are now in contact with leading companies such as Space Solar. Artist's concept of a solar power satellite in place Image: NASA, Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain A group of scientists from King’s College London analyzed the potential of SBSP using designs based on NASA’s cost and performance projections for 2050. Their analysis used a near-baseload, low technology readiness level (TRL) design incorporating mirror-like reflectors, or heliostats, which direct sunlight to a single concentrator, enabling nearly 99.7% annual power availability. The study found that this SBSP design can cut total systems costs by 7% to 15%, offset up to 80% of wind and solar, and reduce battery usage by over 70% (although they noted that hydrogen remains important for seasonal balancing). Their study, “Assess space-based solar power for European-scale power system decarbonization,” waspublishedin the scientific journal Joule in August 2025. “SBSP can provide nearly continuous renewable generation and cover a wide range of areas when deployed in space. As we show in the paper, its role varies significantly depending on system scale,” Dr. Wei He, corresponding author and senior lecturer at King’s College London’s Department of Engineering, toldpv magazine. The King’s College researchers claim their study is the first to explore how beneficial SBSP could be for European grids and that it is the first to provide a cost estimation of using this technology in the European market. Image: Xinyang Che,Lijun Liu,Wei He, Joule 2025, published by Elsevier Inc. According to He, the reaction to the study from the PV industry thus far has been mixed. “I received a range of reactions, from excitement to skepticism. Some believe SBSP is still distant from the current priorities of the PV industry and electrical grids, while other sectors, such as the space economy and space solar, are very enthusiastic about this assessment.” When asked whether energy storage companies have reasons to be concerned by SBSP as a rival technology, He said this is not the case. “I do not consider SBSP a major concern for energy storage companies, as its development remains highly uncertain through 2050, despite its great potential. Overall, energy storage will remain vital now and in the future, even with NASA’s optimistic forecast for SBSP development.” “If I were an energy storage provider, I would monitor SBSP’s progress, as well as other continuous clean generators like nuclear fusion, considering their scale and siting, and examine how the role of energy storage changes across locations and over time,” said the academic.

While the paper acknowledged the potential for SBSP to assist Europe in achieving its net-zero target by 2050, the authors added that the feasibility of the technology is still under review. Besides the lower TRL design which yielded compelling results, the scientists also looked at another design – also based on NASA’s 2050 projections. This was a partially intermittent, higher TRL planar design, which emerged as less cost-competitive than the first option. It would need additional cost reductions to compete with both the heliostat design and terrestrial renewables, according to the study. The first engineering design for a solar power satellite was produced by NASA engineer Peter Glaser in 1968. Widespread deployment of SBSP has been limited due to issues such as its high upfront capital costs, orbital debris risk, beam safety regulation, and public acceptance of kilometer-scale receiving stations based on Earth. However, recent technological milestones such as multi-junction and lightweight photovoltaic cells achieving near 47% efficiency, and the fact that modular in-orbit assembly, and successful wireless power demonstrations have all reached mid-range TRLs suggest SBSP may evolve “from a niche concept to a technically viable solution by the 2030s,” stated the paper. The paper added that the costs associated with launching these systems have significantly reduced due to reusable launch vehicles and that advances in system design have further strengthened the technical foundations of SBSP. While in-orbit manufacturing obstacles and policy frameworks remain, major space agencies are “actively shaping regulatory pathways, motivating the need to understand SBSP’s potential contribution to net-zero goals,” the paper observed.

United Kingdom-based companySpace Solarrecently demonstrated the viability of in-orbit manufacturing as part of its Cassidi research program. “When developing this work, as described in the paper, we did not consult any UK or wider European space-based solar companies, since the SBSP specifications are entirely based on NASA’s report. However, we are now connected with companies like Space Solar and have begun discussions on SBSP,” said He. The scientists’ paper says Europe can use its tradition of multinational cooperation – including cross-border electricity exchange and satellite ventures under the European Space Agency – to develop and operate a centralized SBSP infrastructure. “As a continent-scale solution to provide stable, baseload-scale renewable supply, SBSP would reduce the continent’s reliance on gas-fired power, thereby lowering emissions and enhancing energy security,” the paper stated.

    "full_text": "Azerbaijan and Chinese solar manufacturer Sichuan Sunsync have revealed plans to build a solar panel factory in the Alat Free Economic Zone, south of Baku. Image: Zulfugar Karimov, Unsplash The Azerbaijani authorities are teaming up with a solar cell and panels manufacturer from China's Sichuan province to build an export-focused PV module factory in a free economic zone near Baku. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev recently met Xie Yi, founder and chairman of Sichuan Sunsync Photovoltaic Technology Co., in Tianjin, China, to discuss the plan, according to a statement from the president’s office. The project, south of the Azerbaijani national capital on the Caspian Sea coast, is designed to meet modern technological standards. Most of its output will be exported, said the Azerbaijani government. Xie reportedly said that the investment decision reflects Azerbaijan’s favorable business environment and strategic ties between Azerbaijan and China. The two sides did not disclose any financial terms. Separately, Russian news agency Interfax reported that the venture will create one of Azerbaijan’s first large-scale solar manufacturing sites. Yibin-based Sichuan Sunsync produces tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells and modules. It also offers integrated solar power systems and energy storage solutions for utility-scale, commercial, and residential projects. In April, Azerbaijan signed three separate agreements withChinese companies to develop solar projects, as part of a broader push in recent months to attract foreign investment and expand the country’s renewable energy capacity. Officials said the deals aim to strengthen bilateral cooperation and support utility-scale solar development. In November 2024, Azerbaijan awarded100 MW of new solar capacityin an auction, with the lowest bid coming in at €0.0354 ($0.041)/kWh. This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

    "full_text": "Scientists have used a dual-functional, material-sharing strategy with ethyl viologen diiodide to achieve synergistic performance enhancement in PV-powered batteries. The system was reportedly able to power a wearable glucose monitor for 24 hours. Schematic of the all-perovskite PV-powered battery A research team from theCity University of Hong Konghas developed an integrated PV-powered battery (PVB) for portable electronics that can purportedly achieve stable photo-charging/discharging cyclability. The scientists said that, in the design of the new device, they were able to overcome challenges in integration, miniaturization, and flexibility through a dual-functional, material-sharing strategy using ethyl viologen diiodide (EVI2). “Traditional PVBs typically comprise externally connected independent solar cells and batteries. While this configuration is straightforward and relatively efficient, it lacks the potential for high integration, miniaturization, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness,” the group said. “An advanced, fully integrated design could overcome these limitations by harnessing the combined advantages of solar cell and battery technologies. The pursuit of highly efficient light-active materials with well-engineered surface properties, is critical for optimizing the power conversion efficiency from solar to electrical energy.” At the center of the novel device was the use of EVI2 in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and rechargeable batteries. The strong aromatic conjunction inherent in this compound, the group explained, accelerates electron transfer in the interface of perovskite and charge transport layer in perovskite solar cells. Concurrently, it is also augmenting the intrinsic charge transfer capacity within the ethyl viologen tin iodide (EVSn2I6) cathode in batteries. The team created two versions of the cell, one using a rigid substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO) and the other using flexible polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) and ITO. After making the perovskite solution, they applied it by spin-coating, and following that, they treated the surface with the EVI2 solution. To create the batteries, the team first needed to prepare the EVSn2I6 cathode material by mixing several solutions. Finally, to make the battery itself, a slurry containing EVSn2I6 powder, carbon, and binder is coated onto carbon cloth and assembled into CR2032 coin cells. “The PVB devices were constructed by integrating battery components onto the PSC module within an Ar-filled glovebox. A PET film was adhered to the module using UV glue, to isolate the perovskite solar cell from the battery section, while also providing protection to the perovskite layer,” the academics explained. “For the application, a charging voltage protection board was connected between the PSC’s ITO electrode and the EVSn2I6 cathode and was built into the commercial continuous glucose monitor.” The research team explained that the proposed material-sharing strategy demonstrated highly efficient and stable perovskite cells with an efficiency of 26.11% and the ability to retain 96.2% of the initial efficiency after 1,000 h. The batteries using EVSn2I6 perovskitoid cathodes were found to deliver a capacity decay of just 0.0011% per cycle. “Benefiting from the advanced material design and internal stacking device structure, the integrated PVB devices achieve an overall energy conversion efficiency of 18.54%, while the fabricated flexible PVB devices maintain an overall energy conversion efficiency of 17.62%,” the group concluded. “This device reliably powers a wearable glucose monitor for continuous 24-h operation, enabling real-time data tracking and transmission, thus highlighting the potential of flexible PVB devices in portable electronics.” The system was presented in “Highly efficient all-perovskite photovoltaic-powered battery with dual-function viologen for portable electronics,” published inNature Communications.

    "full_text": "Andrew Early and Ben Echeverria of EPC Burns & McDonnell continue their list of tips for navigating the choppy waters of battery storage project delivery. This exclusive feature article is based on an entry first posted on the Burns & McDonnell corporate blog by Andy Early. Today, the authors run through numbers 6-10;for 1-5, read yesterday’s instalment. There are a surprising variety of battery storage facilities, meaning that use cases can also be widely varied. As a result, many different technology options are available. It’s imperative to have a clear understanding of the operational goals, risk tolerance and site conditions. What are the operational constraints or safety requirements? Will there be a defined goal for return on investment? Are there any high-risk exposures or sensitive receptors nearby? How will the facility be operated and maintained? The answers to these and other questions will drive the selection of technologies. There are many nuances to each technology choice, as well as how each scales up. Understanding the long-term demands and expected performance of the BESS facility is a critical step. With that many variables, the owner or developer faces added complexity. For example, energy density is a big consideration if the project is on a relatively tight site. The project budget and schedule must account for site parameters along with many other variables that may impact ROI. Inverter technology is one of the biggest variables for many projects. A number of big names in the OEM space are introducing AC solutions, thus avoiding the need for a DC box with each one paired with an inverter. Still, there are use cases in which the DC solution is preferred because of the ability to install more power per-square-foot than would typically be possible with the AC pathway. Whether the choice is AC or DC, the use case will dictate a whole menu of options. Coordinating permitting and engineering is prudent to avoid rework, change orders and schedule delays. Both functions go hand-in-hand, and managing both processes at the same time is a prudent approach. Some design input is needed to start the permitting process, and design must have progressed sufficiently to avoid snags in permit applications. If all permitting implications are thought through in conjunction with the design and bid processes, a lot of issues can be avoided. Don’t take the risk of having permits pulled that require a whole different type of fire alarm system that wasn’t accounted for earlier in design. BESS projects are unlike traditional power projects. Not only can local requirements from the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) significantly impact the project, but other site-specific inputs like topography, geotechnical parameters, utility interconnection requirements, and local community considerations may also come into play. The industry is moving at such a rapid pace that no two projects are built the same. While it feels like industry standards are getting closer with respect to how projects will be built, the future is not certain, particularly as more projects are built outside of optimal site locations. Every site will be different, and moving targets are becoming commonplace. Many OEMs are convinced they have the secret sauce with superior products that are safer and more efficient than those of competitors. These design details are considered proprietary and closely held with little transparency. This can make it a challenge to execute designs in such a way that can be scaled up to large BESS facilities. Internal wiring diagrams and component-level data must be shared to verify code compliance and integrate safety, reliability and compliance for the product as well as the project as a whole. This transparency issue will be a focus in the2026 edition of NFPA 855, but until that update is published, the owner and EPC contractor will need to keep the pressure on equipment manufacturers to share the wiring diagrams and component-level data needed to integrate systems at the site level. Many OEMs hold important and/or safety-related details close to the chest due to concerns over leaks of proprietary product information. It’s well known that intellectual property (IP) protection is nonexistent in some Asian countries, so theft of proprietary product data often is a reality. That mentality has percolated into the industry, resulting in a reluctance to share important scope splits and takeoffs for shared systems that get scaled up for a project. Not having detailed knowledge makes it difficult for either the owner or the EPC firm to execute design and convey the pedigree of those systems. AHJs are not going to accept a statement that they can’t see what’s inside a building. They will not be satisfied looking at a fire alarm diagram and being told to simply trust that the system was installed in such a way that it meets the code. Inspectors will want to visually verify systems, so transparency takes precedence over intellectual property concerns with life safety systems. Hiring an EPC contractor before choosing the technology can make all the difference. Reputable EPC contractors have experience with a wide variety of technologies and integration approaches that can help owners make the right choices to meet the demands of a particular project. It’s often a track record of both good and bad experiences, allowing owners to benefit from lessons learned by others in this young industry. It’s important to understand what is brought to a project by a truly integrated EPC partner, versus those that sub out each package. With so many moving parts and pieces, the true benefit of EPC is in the integration of all disciplines. The best case is involving an EPC contractor prior to development of a technology short list. It is unfortunate that developers have sometimes inflicted damage to their own projects based on faulty assumptions that have blown budgets or destroyed schedules. Early integration with an EPC contractor can optimise the project for success and performance in a collaborative environment that explores the pros and cons of various technology pathways, leading to development of project scopes, schedules and budgets that meet expectations of all stakeholders. As BESS technology evolves, the outlook is bright for the overall market. Despite recent rollbacks affecting many renewable categories, energy storage, along with geothermal, nuclear and hydro, are not facing the same obstacles. Those sources retain full tax credit eligibility for construction projects until year-end 2033, before facing gradual rollbacks of 75% in 2034, 50% in 2035 and 0% thereafter. Though some headwinds still are possible — given China’s dominance of the lithium market as well as potential future trade uncertainty — developers, IPPs and utilities can expect continued efficiency and optimal performance from their next project. Paying attention to the 10 key fundamentals of effective project execution is a recipe for success. Andrew Early, PE, is a preconstruction manager for energy storage projects at Burns & McDonnell.

    "full_text": "Chile is leading Latin America’s wave of energy storage adoption, closely linked to its embrace of solar PV, as these recent stories from our colleagues atPV Techattest. Spanish independent power producer (IPP) Grenergy has sold the fourth phase of its flagship solar-plus-storage project in Chile, Oasis de Atacama. Infrastructure investor CVC DIF, a subsidiary of asset manager CVC, acquired the project for up to US$475 million. As part of the agreement, the Spanish IPP will provide operations and maintenance services for five years. Dubbed Gabriela, this phase represents one-tenth of the entire Oasis de Atacama project—2GW of solar PV and 11GWh of BESS—with 272MW of solar PV and 1.1GWh of battery energy storage system (BESS). As the name of the project indicates, it is located in the solar hotbed of the Atacama Desert, in northern Chile. Currently under construction, the commercial operation date for the fourth phase is expected in the first half of 2026. Financing for Gabriela was secured at the beginning of the year with international financial banks BNP Paribas, Natixis, Société Générale, the Bank of Nova Scotia and SMBC. In January, Grenergysecured US$324 million in green financingfor Gabriela’s construction, as covered byEnergy-Storage.news. In total, Grenergy has now sold one-third of the Oasis de Atacama project and retains 1.2GW of solar PV and 7.3GWh of BESS. Late last year,the company sold the first three phases of the project—which combine 451MW of solar PV and 2.5GWh of BESS—to ContourGlobal, a subsidiary of investment firm KKR. The first two phases of the project were commissioned in April 2025, while the third phase is expected to be operational in the second half of this year. Read the full version of this story atPV Tech. Spanish construction firm GES (Global Energy Services) has secured a contract to build a roughly 700MW solar-wind-storage hybrid project in Chile. The company said the project, located in the Antofagasta region of Chile, is the largest in its history, comprising a cumulative 695MW of solar PV, wind power and energy storage capacity. The project is expected to come online in 2027. Sources familiar with the operation toldPV Techthat the site is being developed and owned by AES Andes, the Chilean electricity utility. Last month, AES Andes announced 1.3GW of co-located renewable energy projects in Chile, including the Pampas project, a solar-wind-storage hybrid site in Antofagasta featuring 229MW of solar PV, 128MW of wind capacity and a 171MW 5-hour duration battery energy storage system (BESS). GES said the expansion in Chile supports its strategy to spread into international markets. It has already built over 1,178 MW of wind and solar PV projects in Chile. It also marks its plan to move away from standalone solar and wind projects and operate with a “strong commitment to energy storage.” José Luis García Donoso, CEO of GES, added: “The combination of three renewable technologies in a single facility sets the short-term direction for the sector. Furthermore, it will be the facility with the largest storage capacity in Latin America to date.” To read the full version of this story, visitPV Tech. Independent power producer (IPP) Verano Energy has closed a US$204 million financing for a 83MW/660MWh solar-plus-storage project in Chile. Located in the northern region of Atacama, the Domeyko Solar + Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) project is currently under construction. The project is expected to begin its commercial operation by the end of 2026. The capacity generated by the project will be provided to Chilean gas provider Abastible,under a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA). The Domeyko project will require a total capital expenditure of US$247 million, which will be financed through a US$176 million finance term loan provided by a consortium of international banks that includes SMBC, Société Générale and Scotiabank. The latter will also provide US$12 million in VAT debt financing, while equity will be provided by Lumina Capital Management, a global investment fund specialising in sustainable infrastructure. Dylan Rudney, CEO of Verano Energy, said: “In just over a decade, we have evolved from a solar developer into a fully integrated independent power producer with projects across Chile, Colombia, Argentina and Peru.” To read the full version of this story, visitPV Tech.

    "full_text": "The UK had one of its best months of the year for large-scale BESS projects being completed, in August. That’s according to the latest monthly data from Solar Media Market Research’sBattery Storage: UK Pipeline & Completed Assets Database report, and this exclusive snapshot, brought to you as part of ourmonthly series. The report shows 427MW/854MWh of grid-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) project capacity coming online last month. The bulk of that figure is the300MW/600MWh Thurrock projectfrom Statera, which is now the UK’s biggest BESS project, while Gresham House Energy Storage Fund (GRID) completed its87MW/174MWh West Bradford and 40MW/80MWh Shipton BESS projects. A fire at the Thurrock BESS project occurred in February, when one containerised unit caught fire but was contained and extinguished within 24 hours, with construction resuming shortly after. Other projects were also announced as completed in August. Eku Energy announced the start of commercial operations on its28MW/56MWh Basildon and 39MW/55MWh Loudwaterprojects, and Field did the same for its50MW/100MWh Auchterawproject. Foresight Group, via its Foresight Solar and FGEN funds,energised the 50MW Sandridge BESS. However, construction on these projects was completed earlier, so they were not counted towards August’s total. The new completed capacity brings the UK’s total fleet of operational grid-scale BESS to 7,582MW by power rating and 11,369MWh by capacity. Only February has seen more capacity come online in 2025, when425MW/952MWh was completed. August also saw numerous significant announcements of investments and planning approvals of UK BESS Projects. Some 1,509MW/3,018MWh of combined capacity received planning consent, includingBayWa r.e.’s Redshaw BESS. Meanwhile Zenobē bought a400MW ready-to-build (RTB) BESS from Innovaand there weremajor BESS plan announcementsfrom developer-operator Natpower and the UK government’s National Wealth Fund. The UK’s total approved BESS capacity now stands at 73.4GW/152.4GWh. Having planning consent will be key for developers hoping to get their projects through anongoing overhaul of the UK’s grid interconnection queue. Zenobe also enlisted system integrator Wartsila for a 68MW project in Shetland, at the same time as SAE enlisted Canadian Solar for one in Wales,covered in this piece bySolar Power Portal. Note that the report does not track the quantity of projects going into the construction phase, given this can be harder to define.",

    "full_text": "910MWh of battery energy storage systems (BESS) in Queensland, Australia, have been added to AEMO’s Market Management System, signalling readiness for commissioning. According to Geoff Eldridge, National Electricity Market (NEM) and energy transition observer at consultancy Global Power Energy, the two utility-scale BESS include the Supernode Stage 1 and the Brendale BESS. The larger of the two battery storage systems, Supernode Stage 1, is being pursued by global investment manager Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners and is a 250MW/500MWh system. Quinbrookclosed financing on the first stage of the Supernode projectin April 2024, with Australian utility Origin Energy contracted as its exclusive offtaker. The Supernode BESS comprises three stages. When fully completed, the site will be sized at 760MW/3,096MWh, making it one of the largest batteries connected to the NEM. In July 2024, Quinbrook and Origin signed an agreement to encompass full capacity from stage two, which will increase the total size to 520MW/1,856MWh. BESS solutions provider GE Vernova has been tapped to provide the BESS for stagesoneandtwoof the project. Meanwhile, the third stage of the Supernode BESS, which will bring the total size to 760MW/3,096MWh, wasconfirmed earlier this year when Quinbrook inked an offtake agreement with Queensland government-owned energy company Stanwell. David Scaysbrook, co-founder and managing partner of Quinbrook, said at the time that the deal with Stanwell represented a “sell-out” on the Supernode BESS, which is located at the “highly strategic” South Pine site in the Brisbane suburb of Brendale. Supernode BESS is located near Powerlink Queensland’s South Pine substation, approximately 17km north of the Brisbane CBD. It serves as the central node of Queensland’s transmission network, through which about 80% of the state’s electricity is transmitted daily. It is worth noting that the Supernode BESS is part of a broader development that aims to integrate a low-carbon data centre complex. In the same suburb of Brisbane, developer Akaysha Energy has seen its 205MW/410MWh 2-hour duration Brendale BESS added to the AEMO’s Market Management System. Construction on the Brendale BESS started in August last year, and commercial operations are expected to commence in 2026. Similar to the Supernode BESS, it will be located next to the South Pine substation. As reported byEnergy-Storage.newsearlier this year, Akaysha Energy secured a long-term offtake agreement,confirmed to be a battery revenue swap arrangement, with commodities trading company Guvnor Group. This agreement helps provide revenue certainty for the Brendale BESS while allowing BlackRock-backed Akaysha Energy to optimise operations and respond to market signals. The developer confirmed at the time that it isexploring similar deals for its Japanese BESS assetswith Guvnor Group. Akaysha, whichlast month switched on Waratah Super Battery, the “world’s most powerful battery storage system,”has incorporated Tesla Megapack technology for the Brendale BESS. This is the first time the company has employed the technology, after using Powin battery technology for the Waratah Super Battery and300Wh Ulindaprojects in New South Wales. Earlier this year, Powinfiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcyafter admitting itstruggled to compete with Chinese OEMs’ integrated BESS offerings. In anexclusive interview withESN Premiumlast month, Nick Carter, CEO of Akaysha Energy, modestly said that this was “not optimal”, but the situation had gone “incredibly smoothly” so far.

    "full_text": "Energy-Storage.news speaks with Karina Hershberg, Associate Principal at engineering firm PAE Engineers, on integrating microgrids with sustainable building design. Microgrids are autonomous energy systems capable of functioning independently or linked to the main grid. They offer the flexibility to switch between modes, allowing communities or critical facilities, like hospitals or emergency shelters, to disconnect from the grid during outages. The systems are gaining popularity in regions vulnerable to extreme weather or wildfires. For instance, microgrids are starting to be commonly used in California because they can disconnect from the main grid during power outages and keep supplying energy. Underscoring the technology’s importance, in 2023, the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) programme was announced by then US Secretary of EnergyJennifer Granholm and White House Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator Mitch Landrieu. GRIP was a US$10.5 billion programme that looked to “strengthen grid resilience and reliability” across the US, including funding for 400 separate microgrids. PAE’s Karina Hershberg says of microgrids now, “Every day, I’m talking with clients about their interest in microgrids, and a lot of it’s coming from an interest in energy resilience, an interest in having a little bit more agency over their energy systems, over their utility bills, and over the type of energy that they’re getting.” A similar sentiment was echoed inESN Premium’s interview with microgrid solutions provider BoxPower’s Director of Business Development, Fallon Vaughan and Sales and Marketing Coordinator Noa Schachtel, when Vaughan noted: “Microgrids are traditionally seen as backup or grid-tied systems to provide energy when the distribution or the wider grid fails. But for us, we see these as a complete energy alternative, so they have to perform as such.” PAE is increasingly including microgrids, with numerous energy storage options, in its engineering projects. PAE was founded in 1967. In 2013, the company built a new office in Seattle, Bullitt Centre, the world’s largest commercial ‘Living Building’ in an urban setting. Essentially, it is a regenerative, self-sufficient building built to last for 500 years. Hershberg notes, “We have on-site solar, and then we have on-site batteries. Batteries that can go inside buildings—that is not a market that has a lot of options right now.” The company started integrating microgrids, Hershberg says, a little over a decade ago. “We slowly started to see more and more microgrids. We were coming at it from a place of belief that this really was the future of energy systems, but there wasn’t an understanding of the industry. The technology wasn’t ready yet. The necessary systems infrastructure wasn’t ready yet.” Hershberg continues, “There has been such a transformation, even in recent years, as the technologies are maturing much more. But I think, too, there’s been this growing awareness within building owners, communities, and society at large, that we are in this sort of transition happening in our energy systems and our relationship with our energy systems.” The company often installs microgrids that pair solar PV with a battery energy storage system (BESS). However, PAE has also done projects integrating in-pipe hydro energy storage and small-scale biomass storage. Typically, BESS for PAE’s microgrids are less than 1MW and more than 100kW. Hershberg explains it as “not residential scale, not utility-scale, right in that middle. There aren’t a lot of companies offering that product. We call it the missing middle.” She continues, “Elm is the only real player in it right now, and they have a good product, team, and control system. I’m thankful that they exist in the industry right now, because they can fill that little niche. Still, it is interesting that there’s a lot of interest and demand in the bigger-than-a-Tesla-Powerwall, less-than-a-megawatt range, and just not much product availability right now.” Elm is a microgrid company with a small business BESS solution, the ‘ELM CMG’. Elm’s BESS has a capacity of 258kWh and uses lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells. The company says it uses US-based manufacturing and a domestic supply chain. In April 2024, it opened a manufacturing and distribution facility in The Colony, Texas, to design and manufacture its microgrid and solar thermal technology. It also has a manufacturing site in Oklahoma. Following the signing of theUS budget reconciliation bill, there has been an increased focus on establishinga US supply chain for BESS materials. Hershberg explains, “We’ve definitely seen shovel-ready projects that went on hold because of loss of federal funding and things like that. There’s been some straightforward impacts to projects and the communities that they were benefiting.” Despite these challenges, Hershberg believes microgrids will remain popular. “Even though there’s a lot of uncertainty on things like the investment tax credit (ITC), and how it affects project costs, etc. I have not seen any decrease in interest in these systems. I would argue very strongly that I’ve seen a notable increase in interest in these systems, I think, in reaction to a lot of the other uncertainty happening,” Hershberg says.",

    "full_text": "East Point Energy has been dealt a blow in its pursuit to construct a 150MW/600MWh BESS in Maryland, after local planning officials rejected a rezoning request sought by the developer. With Worcester County’s zoning ordinance not accounting for BESS, the developer submitted its rezoning request on the grounds that the project “aligns with the County’s provisions for public utility infrastructure and essential services,” which are permitted by special exception. This isn’t the first stumbling block encountered by East Point this year, after the developerwithdrew plans for a 116MW BESS destined for upstate New Yorkin response to a local moratorium preventing development of the technology. Plans for the Cedar Hall Energy Center project were presented to the Worcester County Zoning Board of Appeals on 14 August by East Point Energy project developer Benjamin Hadlock, alongside attorney Mark Spencer Cropper. As outlined by Hadlock, the project is proposed for a rural 15-acre site located on the outskirts of Pocomoke City in Worcester County, Maryland. In deciding where to locate the project, East Point opted for this location due to its rural nature and close proximity to transmission lines owned by utility Delmarva Power that feed directly into the PJM Interconnection electricity grid. In order to minimise impacts to the surrounding viewshed, East Point Energy sited the project towards the interior of the parcel and planned to utilise vegetative screening. After listening to concerns voiced by officials during an initial meeting held in July, East Point increased the amount of vegetative buffering located in the northeastern corner of the site. “This facility will be completely screened from public view – for it not to be seen or heard by anybody driving by the site,” explained Hadlock. With buffering being a key sticking point for officials and local residents, Cropper highlighted the differences between East Point Energy’s Cedar Hall proposal and an operational 1MW/3MWh BESS owned by Delmarva Power, also located in the County of Worcester. While showing the zoning board a photo of Delmarva Power’s Ocean City BESS, Cropper pointed out “a fence that surrounds the facility that is not a blockade … you can see right through it.” In designing the BESS, East Point worked closely with Worcester County Fire Marshal’s office and paid for officials to attend a ‘BESS 101’ fire training provided by fire safety specialist group Energy Safety Response Group (ESRG). As outlined within its recent application, “the training addressed fundamental firefighting principles specific to BESS incidents, equipping responders with a better understanding of the unique challenges these systems present.” Following questioning from the board during the recent meeting, Hadlock acknowledged previous BESS fires that had occurred in the US before pointing out how far the technology had advanced in recent years. Interestingly, in discussing BESS fires, Hadlock used the example of an explosion that happened in 2019 atthe McMicken ESS facility in Surprise, Arizona, over more recent incidents. Before rounding off his address to the zoning board, Hadlock touched upon the benefits of locating a BESS at the site over alternative renewable technologies. “We think this is a solution that eliminates the concerns for both visual impacts that you might have from wind – which we hear about quite frequently – and then prime agricultural impacts that you might have with solar,” said Hadlock, in an apparent reference to the Trump Administration’s continued opposition to the deployment of offshore wind turbines. Following East Point’s presentation, the board conducted an almost hour-long public hearing on the project, with almost all speakers voicing their opposition to the plans. After the public hearing, the board voted 4-1 in favour of dismissing East Point’s rezoning request without much further discussion taking place. Despite the majority of the meeting participants rejoicing and preparing to leave at this point, one zoning board member was heard questioning the enforceability of its decision. “You need to put on the record why you are denying the motion,” said the official, followed by another who added, “otherwise, it will get appealed.” Because of this, the zoning board decided only to deny East Point’s rezoning request on a preliminary basis. The zoning board will now gather evidence to back its denial ahead of its next meeting, scheduled for 11 September, where a final decision will be made. East Point Energy has been contacted byEnergy-Storage.newsfor comment on the zoning board’s decision.",

    "full_text": "The market share of vertically integrated battery cell and BESS companies has fallen since 2023, market intelligence firm Rho Motion said. The firm’s research shows that the battery energy storage system (BESS) market share of lithium-ion OEMs like CATL and BYD peaked in 2023 at over 40% and has now fallen to under 30% in the first half of 2025. ‘This was largely due to theLFP cell price surge in 2022, which gave cell players the advantage of being able to produce systems at lower costs, since cells made up the largest cost component of ESS systems,’ the firm said. Price falls and an expansion of the battery industry has brought in more players and broadened the range of options available to BESS producers, allowing them to compete more with vertically integrated players, Rho Motion said. The market overall is becoming less consolidated, although remains top-heavy. The infographic above shows companies’ market share in 2023, 2024 and H1 2025. CATL’s went from 20% in 2023 to 14% in H1 2025 while BYD’s went from 17% to 9%. The biggest examples of this shift to BESS manufacturers that do not manufacture cells are Sungrow, CRRC and Hyperstrong, whose combined market share went from 20% in 2023 to 30% in H1 2025. Sungrow has grown to be the largest player with a 14% market share in the most recent period, while Tesla has kept a roughly consistent market share over the three periods, going from 11% to 14% to 12%. The UK is a great example of this shift, with many of the very early projects in 2018-2022 supplied by BYD and CATL, but their names typically featuring less heavily than Sungrow, Hithium and Envision and Canadian Solar for newer ones. Note that Rho Motion’s research only looks at the BESS supplier, regardless of whether a system integrator sits in between the supplier and the buyer. Other companies’ research typically categorises projects by the system integrator or final seller, meaning CATL ranks lowly or does not appear at all in their reports. Rho Motion’s report also noted that system integration ability is proving more important, echoing what we heard from system integrator Prevalon in aninterview earlier this year forESN Premium. A similar trend of (relatively) newer BESS-specialised cell suppliers taking market share from the established OEMs is also being seen on the cell supply side, Rho Motion said. In H1 2025, Hithium and Eve Energy joined CATL in the top three, overtaking BYD. Rho Motion is part of upstream specialist Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.",

    "full_text": "Katherine Hutton, product manager of cybersecurity at Fluence, discusses why cybersecurity is critical for battery storage systems and how to navigate this increasingly complex area. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) have moved from emerging technology to a critical part of national energy strategies. In Australia, they are already integral to balancing the National Electricity Market (NEM), enabling greater penetration of renewable energy generation, and improving grid reliability. Globally, growth is accelerating at significant rates: over the next five years (2025-2029), BESS deployment is expected to grow at 30% annually in the United States, 45% in the European Union (EU), and 20–25% across Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, and India. This expansion is happening in parallel with a continued transformation in how operational technology (OT) is designed and managed. Instead of physically walking through facilities to check levels, pumps, and valves, operators can now rely on advanced software tools for analytics and visualisation. Today’s grid infrastructure is increasingly digital, interconnected, and remotely controlled – a shift that brings significant efficiency and flexibility but also demands a strong, proactive approach to cybersecurity. Governments and industry bodies are moving to establish consistent security expectations for critical infrastructure. In a landmark move, Australia has adopted the ISA/IEC 62443 series as national standards for protecting operational technology. Developed by the International Society of Automation (ISA) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), this framework outlines how security should be integrated into industrial automation and control systems throughout their lifecycle. Its modular, role-based approach allows asset owners, service providers, and equipment suppliers to apply the sections relevant to their responsibilities, ensuring alignment without prescribing a one-size-fits-all checklist. Internationally, other governments are moving in a similar direction to define cybersecurity requirements for critical infrastructure and a broader scope of industries. In the European Union, the NIS2 Directive extends security requirements to a wider range of energy assets, including smaller-scale energy storage, while the Cyber Resilience Act will, from December 2027, require that all products with digital elements meet lifecycle security obligations. In the United States, both federal and state measures are increasing scrutiny of supply chain integrity, remote access security, and vendor accountability. These policies vary in detail but converge on the same principle: cybersecurity must be part of the design and procurement process, not an afterthought. The operational role and architecture of BESS determine how security must be managed. Cyber-capable components such as battery management systems (BMS), power conversion systems (PCS), and energy management systems (EMS) each contain software and communications pathways that require secure maintenance throughout the system’s life. These elements demand greater scrutiny than passive components like battery cells or structural parts. Remote access is essential for performance optimisation and troubleshooting, but it must be governed by strict protocols to prevent misuse. Similarly, global supply chains support rapid scaling but can obscure visibility into the origins and update histories of components, making transparency critical. Recent investigations have uncovered troubling cases of undocumented communication features in power electronics, illustrating how supply chain opacity can conceal security vulnerabilities. In response, several countries have moved to restrict or remove certain manufacturers’ equipment from critical infrastructure, underscoring that supply chain risks are not hypothetical but active concerns. This does not mean storage systems are inherently unsafe. In fact, BESS offers a unique opportunity for resilience. Unlike legacy grid infrastructure, which can be difficult and costly to secure after deployment, battery storage can be designed with cybersecurity built in from the outset. When properly protected, BESS can strengthen overall grid resilience by providing reliable backup power and stabilisation during disruptions affecting other grid assets. Well-secured energy storage, therefore, is not merely a risk to manage but a critical part of the cybersecurity solution. While each BESS project is unique, certain foundational measures can greatly reduce exposure to cyber threats. Drawing on lessons from across the industry, these practices address common vulnerabilities and can help enable secure and resilient systems over decades of operation. Securing BESS is most effective when it is built in from the outset and sustained throughout the system’s life. By embedding strong protections early, operators can safeguard performance, avoid costly retrofits, and keep assets resilient as threats evolve. When security is built into every stage of development and operations, storage can operate as a trusted pillar of modern grids, supporting reliability, protecting investments, and enabling the energy transition to advance with confidence. Katherine Huttonis the product manager for cybersecurity at Fluence, where she develops solutions to strengthen cybersecurity capabilities across the company’s operational technology and digital products. She stays at the forefront of evolving threats and global regulatory requirements affecting critical infrastructure asset owners, operators, and vendors in the renewable energy sector.",

    "full_text": "Hithium has shipped the first battery energy storage systems (BESS) manufactured at its new plant in Texas, US. The Xiamen, China-headquartered manufacturer, announced the start of shipments from its new factory in Mesquite, Texas, a few days ago (28 August). The vertically integrated company, which makes battery cells, modules and complete systems for stationary BESS applications,officially opened the 484,441-square foot facilityin May. The factory’s construction was first announced in July 2024, when the company said itwould invest an initial US$100 million in the plant, although this sum had doubled by its opening. Planned annual production capacity is 10GWh, although Hithium has not shared how that capacity is split between battery modules and complete systems. The Mesquite factory is not thought to include cell production lines. “Local manufacturing lets us meet American standards, respond quickly to demand, and work with communities and partners to drive the clean energy transition,” Hithium VP of North America operations James Boswell said. At the time the factory was announced last year, the US government under then-president Joe Biden was seeking to promote domestic clean energy supply chains, leading to a rush of investments in manufacturing being announced across the country. Policy uncertainty over issues such as import tariffs and stricter rules on using Chinese imported battery products since Donald Trump took office has contributed to an estimated21GWh of planned BESS cell manufacturing capacity being cancelledsince the beginning of this year, according to market intelligence firm Clean Energy Associates (CEA). However, despite this reduction in planned capacity, coming mainly from startups with greenfield developments, investments by bigger players in the BESS space in both cell and BESS assembly are bearing fruit. Solar Media Market Researchanalyst Charlotte Gisbourne recently wrote in a Guest Blog for this site that capacity additions from Tesla, Canadian Solar and LG Energy Solution will bringUS-based annual BESS cell manufacturing capacity to more than 50GWhby the end of 2026. There will be about the same amount of BESS assembly capacity in the country by the end of this year, Gisbourne wrote, noting that cell production plants take longer to build and cost more than module and systems assembly facilities. Under the current administration, BESS project developers are still able to avail of a 10% adder through domestic content bonuses to the investment tax credit (ITC) and manufacturers the 45x production tax credit (PTC) worth US$35/kWh for cells and US$10/kWh for modules made in the US. However, new restrictions on imported materials or investment from foreign entity of concern (FEOC) companies from China applysince the passing of the H.R.1 ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act’ legislation, intended to drive further self-reliance and lessen dependency on a country the US deems unfriendly. Hithium has yet to announce plans to onshore some of its cell production to the US. The company has, however, made recent headlines for its battery cell technologies made in China. It launched anindustry-first 1175Ah large-format lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cellin June. Mass-produced at a facility in Chongqing, central China, it equips Hithium’s new 6.25MWh containerised BESS solution. The company also said in late August that it had begun mass production of its ∞Cell 587Ah high-capacity energy storage battery cells from its Xiamen factory. The 587Ah cell is based on the same technology as the 1175Ah device but has been adapted for 2-hour duration applications, where the larger cell is suited to applications requiring 4-hours or more duration. According to Solar Media Market Research,Hithium is publicly known to supply cells to four BESS system integrators or manufacturers: NHOA, Risen Energy, Powin (which recently went out of business and its assets substantively acquired by FlexGen) and the company’s own in-house BESS integration projects.",

Egyptian prime minister Dr Mostafa Madouly attended a signing ceremony for a land usufruct contract on Wednesday for the facility, dubbed the ‘Atom Solar Project’, which will be built in New Alamein City, in the Sokhna Industrial Zone in north-eastern Egypt. Backers include Bahraini investor Infinity Capital, leading Chinese manufacturer JA Solar, Egyptian component repair group AH Industrial Management and UAE-headquartered investor Global South Utilities (GSU). The groups will invest a total of US$220 million into the project, and the Egyptian government noted that it expects construction and trial operation to take three years. The government also noted that the factory’s cells will be designated for “export to global markets”, which could be significant as many countries with growing solar sectors look to reduce their reliance on Chinese cell production. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China accounted for 98% of global solar wafer production, and 92% of global solar cell production, as of 2023. Meanwhile, the factory’s modules will be delivered to the domestic and nearby “regional” markets in the Middle East and Africa.

    "full_text": "Renewable energy solutions provider Sunsure Energy claims to have signed India’s first-ever fixed tariff battery storage offtake contract. Sunsure, an independent power producer (IPP) operating a portfolio of wind and solar PV projects, said last week (28 August) that it has signed a battery energy discharge purchase agreement (BEDPA) with utility services provider NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited (NVVN). The two parties have signed the 15-year contract for 125MW/500MWh of capacity from a battery energy storage system (BESS) project to be connected to the 400/220kV Garautha Substation in Jhansi, a city in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Under the agreement, Sunsure must deliver four hours of on-demand power between 6 p.m. and 10 a.m., helping NVVN’s end customer, Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL), meet morning or evening peak electricity demand with clean energy. The IPP did not offer details of the solicitation or process through which it was awarded the contract, but claimed that it is the first of its kind for India in that it will be billed based on a fixed tariff, paid in Indian Rupees per kilowatt-hour of discharged energy, rather than the more common fixed monthly rates. The build, own and operate (BOO) contract is also Sunsure’s first long-term battery storage power supply agreement. The company has a total 500MW portfolio of operational solar PV and wind assets, with a further 2.5GW in construction across various Indian states. “Round-the-clock renewable energy is the need of the modern, growing India. The next generation of clean energy infrastructure will not be the one that works only when the sun shines or when the wind blows – but one that works when India needs it the most,” Sunsure Energy founder, chairman and CEO Shashank Sharma said. Sharma noted that Sunsure has been “quietly building capabilities” toward that future over the past two years, moving from pure-play solar offerings to hybrid renewables-plus-storage technologies for commercial and industrial (C&I) customers. In its utility business, the CEO referenced wins for the company in tenders from the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and hydroelectric power generation company SJVN, alongside NVVN’s “first-of-its-kind BESS deployment in the country.” “We’ve consistently moved up the technology curve, while preserving our returns,” Sharma said. NVVN is a power trading and cross-border energy import subsidiary of NTPC (formerly the National Thermal Power Corporation), another state-owned company like SECI and SJVN. While it may be a first in terms of its contract structure, Sunsure’s latest win sits alongside many different types of hybrid renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs) and energy storage services and purchase agreements that India’s nodal agencies and states are tendering for. India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA) president Debmalya Sen wrote about the different types of tenders, including hybrid renewable energy and standalone energy storage, and the various ways tariffs are awarded and developers remunerated, in a Guest Blog for this site in May. The different designs, such as Round the Clock (RTC), peak-specific, load-following and firm, dispatchable renewable energy (FDRE), are all aimed at answering the needs of grid operators, utilities and energy users with requirements on timings and duration of dispatch. As of the end of the first half of this year, tenders for a cumulative171GWh of energy storage capacity had been held in Indiasince the first was launched in 2018. Over 55GWh have been tendered in 2025 alone. As analyst Charith Konda of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) wrote a few weeks ago, though wildly successful in some respects,the tenders have not been without challenges. For example, the aggressive competition that has seen reverse auction prices fall dramatically could see projects win bids that are not feasible to build, Konda wrote.",

    "full_text": "Hitachi Energy has been successful in its bid to acquire full ownership of Eks Energy, a manufacturer of power conversion systems (PCS). The Switzerland-headquartered energy and power grids subsidiary of Japan’s Hitachi conglomerate announced yesterday that it has completed the acquisition of the remaining 20% stake in Eks Energy (EKS) held by bankrupt US battery storage system integrator Powin. After Powin filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June, rival system integratorFlexGen stepped in as a stalking horse bidder to buy almost all of its assets, including all IP, in a deal whichclosed a few days ago. At the same time, Hitachi Energy bid to buy out the remaining one-fifth of Eks Energy that Powin still owned.Powin bought the companyin 2022 but sold80% of it to Hitachi Energy a year laterin 2023. Eks Energy, headquartered in Spain, was noted for its work on inverters, PCS, and power plant control (PPC) systems for solar PV and mixed-technology microgrids, including in a variety of demanding grid and off-grid environments. Powin executive VP Danny Lu, speaking withEnergy-Storage.newsaround the time of the acquisition, said that PCS equipment represents a small portion of project cost but can be asource of many of the issues that determine the success or failure of energy storage systems. Bringing power electronics in-house meant Powin was not reliant on third-party providers to deliver complex solutions to projects such asAustralia’s flagship ‘shock absorber for the grid,’ Waratah Super Battery, for which Powin brought Eks Energy on board before the acquisition. For Hitachi Energy, which has its own energy storage system (ESS) system integration business along with extensive digital grid edge solutions, the acquisition will allow for greater integration across its suite of products, the company said. Massimo Danieli, managing director of Hitachi Energy’s Grid Automation business unit, said that ownership of the power electronics specialist enabled the company to offer a “comprehensive solution portfolio that combines proven converter and control technology with Hitachi Energy’s global scale, unparalleled grid expertise and digital capabilities.” Hitachi Energy officially launchedin 2021 as a rebrand of Hitachi ABB Power Grids, the joint venture (JV) with ABB that Hitachi fully acquired a year later, buying out theremaining 19.9% stake held by the Swiss automation company. At the beginning of this year, Alberto Prieto, the CEO Hitachi Energy appointed to lead EKS, spoke withESN Premiumabout how the parent company manufactures a wide range of products for high-voltage power applications, renewable energy and energy storage. However, Prieto said, the company saw EKS, spun out of the University of Seville in 2002, as anopportunity to acquire deep specialist knowledge in PCS and control systems, which would become increasingly important as global energy storage markets adopt grid-forming inverter technologies. “At Hitachi Energy, we had been looking to close this gap in the portfolio; we have transformers, we have high-voltage equipment. We were looking for power conversion architecture for a long time,” Prieto toldESN Premiumin the January interview. The company said in its statement yesterday that since its initial investment in the power conversion specialist, it has created a centre of excellence in Seville to increase collaboration across R&D, product development and customer-facing functions.",

    "full_text": "The Australian government has officially launched two Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) tenders in Western Australia, targeting 2.4GWh of energy storage and 1.6GW of renewable energy generation. Announced today (29 August) by Australia’s climate change and energy minister Chris Bowen, the tenders, whichform part of the federal government’s CIS initiative to seek 40GW of renewables and energy storage by 2030, will specifically target projects that will connect to Western Australia’s South-West Interconnected System (SWIS), and by extension, the Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM). According to Bowen, these latest rounds will unlock an estimated AU$4 billion (US$2.62 billion) of additional private investment in the WEM. “These tenders will help deliver cleaner, more reliable and more affordable energy for Western Australian households and businesses,” Bowen said in the announcement. Both tenders will be the first to implement a streamlined single-stage bidding process, consolidating technical and financial proposals, intended toshorten the tender duration from nine months to approximately six. This approach is designed to increase efficiency and support the timely signing of Capacity Investment Scheme Agreements (CISAs). In an interview withESN Premium,Nick Hawke, director of Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), recently said this move was a positive shift for the CIS scheme. Potential proponents are advised to register before 10 October 2025 for both tenders, with bids to close on 7 November. Successful bids into Tenders 5 and 6 are expected to be announced in March 2026. You can find out more about registering via theofficial website. At the recentBattery Asset Management Summit Australia 2025, Thimo Mueller, general manager, commercial at AusEnergy Services Ltd (ASL), formerly AEMO Services, confirmed that theresults from Tender 3 of the CIS initiative will be released “in the coming weeks”. The SWIS faces unique challenges as Western Australia integrates higher levels of renewable energy, particularly rooftop solar, which has led to periods of low daytime demand and increased reliance on dispatchable resources during evening peaks. Tender 6 aims to address these challenges by procuring flexible capacity that can respond to fluctuations in supply and demand. This latest procurement follows the successful completion of Tender 2 for the WEM, whichresulted in four projects being selected for CISAs earlier this year. Those projects will collectively deliver 654MW/2,595MWh of clean dispatchable capacity across Western Australia’s main grid system, slightly exceeding the original target for that procurement round, which stood at 2,000MWh. The winning projects, the Boddington Giga Battery, Merredin Big Battery, Muchea Battery, and Waroona Renewable Energy Project, are scheduled to be operational by October 2027. Each project is 4-hours in duration. Theconsistent oversubscription of previous CIS tendersshowcases strong industry interest in the programme. The first six tenders already account for over half of the total required capacity under the scheme – equivalent to 12.3GW of generation and 6GW of dispatchable capacity. The focus on Western Australia comes amid significant growth in the country’s battery storage sector. As reported byEnergy-Storage.newsearlier this week, recent data from AEMO showed thatBESS has demonstrated the highest reliability among clean energy technologies in Australia. This reliability factor is particularly important for Western Australia’s isolated grid, which operates independently from theNational Electricity Market (NEM)that serves the eastern states. Western Australia’s grid is divided into two isolated networks. The SWIS covers the state’s southwest, including the capital, Perth, and the North West Interconnected System (NWIS), primarily serving the Pilbara mining region. The state has been progressively increasing its renewable energy capacity, creating growing demand for storage solutions to manage intermittency and provide grid stability services.

    "full_text": "Potentia Energy, a joint venture co-owned by Enel Green Power and INPEX, has secured the first environmental approval for a grid-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) under South Australia’s new Hydrogen and Renewable Energy (HRE) Act. The developer said yesterday (28 August) that its AU$400 million (US$261 million) 225MW/900MWh Emeroo BESS project, located approximately 15km northeast of Port Augusta, has received official approval for its Statement of Environmental Objectives (SEO) under the HRE Act, which came into effect on 11 July 2024. The Emeroo BESS will be co-located with the already operational275MW Bungala Solar Farmand is designed to deliver up to 4-hours of energy storage. According to Potentia Energy’s project documentation, the Emeroo BESS will feature a modular design utilising shipping container-based battery units arranged in a grid pattern. Each container will house lithium-ion battery modules, thermal management systems and state-of-the-art fire suppression technology. The facility will also include power conversion systems with inverters and transformers to efficiently manage electricity flow between the battery storage system and the grid. The BESS will connect to the grid and the National Electricity Market (NEM) via ElectraNet’s Emeroo Substation. The company submitted its License Application for the project to the South Australian government in early 2025, making it one of the first projects to test the new regulatory framework established by the HRE Act. With the SEO approval now secured in August 2025, Potentia Energy is targeting the commencement of construction in late 2026, with projected commercial operation scheduled for early 2028. South Australia’s HRE Act, which came into effect in July 2024, represents a shift in how large-scale renewable energy projects are regulated in the state. The legislation specifically targets grid-scale renewable energy and battery storage developments, streamlining approval processes while maintaining environmental safeguards. Under the new regulatory framework, all grid-scale renewable energy developments must now be considered under the HRE Act rather than previous planning legislation. Existing developments already operating were required to obtain a license by July 11, 2025. This regulatory evolution aligns with the Australian Energy Regulator’s (AER) assessment thatincreased energy storage capacity will be essentialto managing daily and seasonal variations in NEM output. South Australian energy and mining minister Tom Koutsantonis welcomed the development, highlighting the state’s leadership in renewable energy integration. “South Australia has been a leader in renewable energy, in particular through our pioneering foray into grid-scale battery storage,” Koutsantonis said. “We couldn’t have got to where we are – on track to 100% net renewable energy generation by 2027 – without good planning and world-leading legislation and policy.” The minister also emphasised that the HRE Act represents “another example of our [South Australia’s] early leadership,” designed to accommodate South Australia’s growing appeal as an investment destination for renewable energy projects while ensuring a “coordinated, orderly and equitable approach to renewable energy infrastructure.” South Australia has established itself as one of the leaders in grid-scale battery storage since hosting Australia’sfirst large-scale BESS at Hornsdale in 2017. Originally commissioned in 2017 at 100MW/129MWh, the Hornsdale Power Reserve BESS was expanded in 2020 to 150MW/193.5MWh. However, due to the uptake of variable renewable energy generation in the state, theAustralian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) predicts that South Australia could experience reliability gaps from 2026-27. Several large-scale BESS projects are set to come online in South Australia in the coming years. For instance, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners’ Summerfield Battery, a 240MW/960MWh system featuring Canadian Solar’s SolBank 3.0 battery technology,commenced construction earlier this year and is expected to be operational in 2027. Pacific Green’s Limestone Coast North Energy Park,recently acquired by Intera Energy for AU$460 million, will add 250MW/500MWh of storage capacity when operational in early 2027.

    "full_text": "French independent power producer (IPP) Neoen, whichis now fully owned by Canadian asset manager Brookfield, has switched on the second phase of its 560MW/2,240MWh Collie BESS in Western Australia. The BESS, which is located in close proximity to Synergy’s 2GWh Collie Battery Energy Storage System (CBESS), has already been discharging energy to the Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) in Western Australia, according to Sally Bogle, vice-president, APAC renewables and power at research company Rystad Energy. Shared on LinkedIn, Bogle also noted that the South West Interconnected System (SWIS), which covers much of the southwest of Western Australia, including the state capital Perth, is currently on track for over 1.6GW/6GWh of operational BESS capacity by the end of 2025, doubling to over 3GW/11GWh by the end of 2029. Stage 1 of the Collie BESS, sized at 219MW/877MWh, began operating in October 2024, less than 18 months after construction commenced. The BESS features 224 Tesla Megapack 2XL units and represents Neoen’s first major project in Western Australia. On 1 October, the BESS began delivering its contracted 197MW/4-hour grid capacity service to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). This service, known as ‘Non-Co-optimised Essential System Services’ (NCESS), is contracted for a two-year period. The BESS charges during daylight hours when solar generation is abundant and discharges during evening peak demand periods. Building on the success of Stage 1, Neoen has now completed the second stage of the Collie Battery, adding 341MW/1,363MWh through the installation of 348 Tesla Megapack 2XL units. In April 2024, Neoen secured a similar 300 MW/4-hour NCESS contract with AEMO for Stage 2. This contract will run for two years from 1 October 2025 and provide 300MW for four hours. In other news, Dom Watson, renewables development lead, future energy at state-owned company Synergy, has confirmed that its 2,000MWh CBESS in Western Australia is on track to be online “by the end of the year”. Speaking on stage at theBattery Asset Management Summit Australia 2025earlier this week, Watson noted that CBESS, which iscurrently undergoing its commissioning phase, will be delivered by the end of the year. Installation of all 640 battery packs and the invertersstarted in early October 2024and wascompleted in April 2025. Construction on the site, which is set to be one of Australia’s largest battery projects, started in March 2024. It is located at the site of the 300MW Collie Power Station, a coal-fired power plant scheduled for decommissioning in 2027. CBESS will be connected to the SWIS. At the Summit, Watson provided a deep dive into Synergy’s operations in Western Australia and how it has transitioned from relying on coal-fired power stations to renewables and energy storage. Indeed, Synergy has several large-scale BESS operational and under construction. For instance, last year, the organisation completed its 200MW/800MWh Kwinana 2 BESS.Construction started in July 2023,and the project was switched on before Christmas 2024. Kwinana 2 is situated adjacent to the first Kwinana BESS 1, a 100MW/200MWh 2-hour duration system, at the existing gas-fired Kwinana Power Station. Although the initial impression when building the large-scale battery storage projects was that the batteries would be the toughest to secure due to demand, Watson pointed out that this was not the case. “What we found ourselves was not only a huge task in delivering pretty material development projects in their own right, but we were also doing that right in the middle of some supply chain issues,” Watson noted “There were supply chain concerns for batteries, inverters and transformers. We initially thought batteries would be the bit of equipment that needed to be secured earlier. But we soon found out that the power conversion systems (PCS) were probably the critical bit of equipment that needed to be secured as quickly as we could.” As such, Watson outlined that Synergy abandoned the traditional engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) model, finding it too rigid and slow for managing supply chain risks across its large project portfolio. Instead, it adopted an “integrator model” that directly managed procurement, design, and construction as separate packages, giving it greater flexibility and control over supply chain challenges during project delivery. “We selected the integrated model, which was great as a concept for delivering these projects at pace. But we realised we weren’t structured to deliver projects like this, and we’d never done it before at Synergy. However, we knew we needed to scale quickly, and we knew we needed to keep delivering at pace with control,” Watson continued. Synergy then formed an “integrated project management team” by partnering with engineering firm GHD, which provided engineering expertise to complete detailed integration designs and develop IFC (Issued for Construction) packages. GHD also supplemented the company’s project management capabilities with additional project managers and control systems. In doing so, this partnership enabled real-time decision-making without commercial constraints, which proved essential for delivering large-scale, complex projects amid supply chain challenges.

    "full_text": "Energy-Storage.news Premium speaks with Sergio Melendez, storage sector manager at CAISO, and Ali Karimian, market optimisation director at GridBeyond, about regulating Bid Cost Recovery Payments in the California Independent System Operator market. Recently, the California Independent System Operator’s (CAISO’s) Market Monitor has identified gaming concerns for battery energy storage system (BESS) facilities in CAISO’s bid cost recovery (BCR) process. CAISOis a non-profit organisation offering three main services for California’s electric grid: grid operator, market administrator, and transmission planner. BCR is the CAISO settlements process through which eligible resources recover their bid costs. From CAISO: “Bid costs comprise start-up bid cost, minimum load bid cost, energy bid cost, transition bid cost, pump shut-down cost, pumping cost, ancillary services bid cost, and Residential Unit Commitment (RUC) availability payment.” “To calculate BCR, the commitment costs and the energy and AS bid costs are used as inputs to calculate a resource’s net difference between costs and revenues in separate pre-calculations for the integrated forward market (IFM), the RUC process, and the real-time market (RTM).” BCR was intended for traditional generation assets, such as natural gas units. The majority of payments in 2024 did go to natural gas units, but BESS was often coming in second, frequently receiving more than solar, hydro, or wind units. That same year, battery storage facilities recovered approximately US$18 million through real-time BCR, representing roughly 11% of the total BCR. As Ali Karimian, Market Optimisation Director at optimiserGridBeyondexplains, “The purpose of the BCR programme is to ensure resource owners are made whole when CAISO dispatches their assets beyond what the owners intended.” Karimian continues, “In recent years, CAISO’s Department of Market Monitoring (DMM) found cases where some asset owners manipulated their bid curves to trigger BCR payments unfairly.” It is important to note that GridBeyond is serving as an expert voice as an operator in CAISO, and says, “we have always prioritised being good grid citizens. We do not engage in market manipulation.” CAISO’s Melendez explains the DMM, saying, “The Department of Market Monitoring’s goal really is to keep an eye on the efficiency and effectiveness of our markets, including the Western energy imbalance market.” “Their job is to provide transparency and information to the market participants, regulators, the CAISO, our board, the governing body, and the challenges we might face, both in terms of market design and operationally. As the name implies, with market monitoring, of course, to monitor for potential detrimental market behaviour and communicate that to the ISO or applicable regulators like FERC.” Proving systematic gaming requires significant resources and burdens CAISO. Consequently, the market operator chose to modify the BCR calculation method to minimise potential abuse. Melendez explains, “When we started seeing storage coming online, we generally extended those (BCR) rules to storage. That initially did not create a bunch of complications because of how storage was participating back then.” “But what we found is that this approach creates some concerns. One was the strategic bidding concern that we were working on last year. The other concern is a little bit more generalised – some of the drivers that required the existence of BCR for conventional resources are not present for batteries.” In November 2024, CAISO submitted a tariff amendment, documented in the DMM’s ‘Storage Bid Cost Recovery and Default Energy Bid Enhancements ‘ report, aimed at solving the battery storage BCR gaming issue. The amendment became effective on 1 December 2024. CAISO’s amendment aims to limit battery bids for calculating BCR payments, primarily to prevent batteries from inflating unjustified BCR payments. This is regarded as an interim solution. According to the DMM’s report, stakeholders pointed out that some cases would still require BCR, but at the same time, unnecessary BCR payments will persist after the policy is enacted. In June, the DMM gave a storage BCR presentation, noting “Importantly, the current BCR rules remove the exposure to real-time prices for storage resources when buying back infeasible day-ahead schedules.” The report continues, stating that the ISO’s current solution only addresses the bid cost component, noting that negative revenues, rather than bid costs, are the primary driver of BCR. From the report, “Batteries will continue to receive BCR for revenue losses, which will continue to distort bidding incentives.” The DMM makes three primary recommendations: eliminate day-ahead BCR for BESS, eliminate most real-time BCR for BESS, and eliminate BCR associated with the Outage Management System (OMS) limitations on state of charge (SOC). For the first recommendation, DMM says it has yet to identify any instance where day-ahead BCR is appropriate and recommends that stakeholders discuss and provide such scenarios. Next, DMM recommends “redesigning the BCR rules to assume no eligibility for batteries and add eligibility only under specific situations where BCR is warranted.” The Monitor says that eliminating default real-time BCR from buying back day-ahead schedules would incentivise more accurate estimation of day-ahead bidding parameters and real-time bidding that reflects intraday opportunity costs based on real-time prices. The final recommendation aligns with other OMS MW capacity derates, which refer to reductions in the available MW capacity of a generation or transmission resource caused by an outage. CAISO and the DMM continue to monitor for gaming behaviour, trying to maintain a fair market for all participants, until everything is fully sorted. Melendez says, “Both DMM and the ISO, we are very much on top of trying to monitor for potentially detrimental market behaviour, and we have the means to be able to, if we identify activity that could entail consequences in terms of applicable regulation, refer that activity to the regulators, in this case, FERC.”",

    "full_text": "California and Texas have been “really good proving grounds” for energy storage technology, according to the CEO of developer Fullmark Energy. Chris McKissack said that while other regions of the US are increasingly of interest, California’s CAISO and Texas’s ERCOT grid and wholesale markets will most likely dominate his discussions with customers and partners at the upcomingRE+solar PV and energy storage trade show taking place in Las Vegas, Nevada, in September. “I expect to be talking to people about California and Texas. I think they really do remain the most stable profiles for energy storage. They’ve been two really good proving grounds for energy storage,” McKissack toldEnergy-Storage.newsin an interview. Fullmark Energy is a developer operating under a build, own and operate (BOO) business model. It was launched in 2018 under the name Hecate Grid and started as a joint venture between clean energy developer Hecate Energy and investor InfraRed Capital Partners. It rebranded as Fullmark earlier this year, marking what the company said was a transition from a primary focus on project development to “a fully integrated energy storage company that develops, finances, builds, owns, and operates standalone BESS projects across the US.” McKissack said that other ISO and RTO regions, such as PJM, SPP, and MISO, are becoming increasingly interesting. However, Fullmark’s initial portfolio of four projects, carried over from the Hecate Grid days, is in California. Three are now complete, and the fourth is under construction. The portfolio, Redwood, includes Desert-Carris and Ortega,two 20MW/40MWh projects that Fullmark announced as online this month, Johanna, a 20MW/80MWh system that went into operation in 2021, and San Jacinto, a 65MW/130MWh system nearing completion. Our interview coincided with news announced yesterday (27 August) that Fullmark Energy has hired cloud-based battery data analytics provider TWAICE to support the four projects in Southern California. The Johanna project is already onboarded to TWAICE’s analytics platform, which provides data, including state of charge (SoC) calculations, cell, module, string, system and power conversion system (PCS) level monitoring and equipment health. TWAICE claims the software solution offers much better system operation and performance visibility than an energy management system (EMS) provided by an energy storage system integrator or OEM alone. Analytics providers TWAICE and rivals like ACCURE or PowerUp have argued that theirtechnology allows operators to detect faults early enough to prevent failures, including thermal events that can lead to fires, and assure high levels of availability for peak events or grid signals to deliver ancillary services. “What’s different about battery storage is that it’s not just a ‘set it and forget it’ system,” Fullmark Energy’s Chris McKissack said. “I’m not saying that other systems are easy to build or easy to operate, but there’s another dimension to battery storage that doesn’t exist with other renewable assets, which is that you actually have to make a lot of day-to-day decisions in how to dispatch, how to operate and how to optimise the system.” The need for deeper visibility and greater control over an asset’s daily and lifetime operation has spurred the adoption of analytics platforms by a growing number of operators. Analytics is also impacting areas like insurance and warranties, with TWAICE, for example,partnering with insurance provider NARDAC. Fullmark’s Chris McKissack attributes California and Texas’s early lead—thepair represents about 65% of total cumulative US grid-scale battery storage deployments—to the two markets’ very different but equally compelling dynamics. “One, [California], where you’ve got really structured offtake opportunities, where you can really underwrite projects based on Resource Adequacy contracts, and I would say, more stable pricing. The other [Texas], where the initial returns were so healthy that you don’t really have to do a lot of explaining.” However, “both markets are saturating in certain ways,” and becoming more competitive, McKissack said. “Now you have to be good at what you’re doing. You can’t just show up. Differentiating by how you operate, what kind of cost you’re getting from your battery suppliers, how you’re doing your O&M, how you’re doing your offtake, how you’re bidding and dispatching in the model, starts to make a real difference between projects and portfolios.” The full interview with Chris McKissack will be published in the coming days forESN Premiumsubscribers.",

    "full_text": "Asset manager MEAG and a subsidiary of inverter specialist SMA have partnered to deploy a 130MW/354MWh BESS in Germany, their second together and one which will deploy ‘next-generation’ inverters. The 2.7-hour duration ready-to-build Hoexter battery energy storage system (BESS) project has a grid connection date of 2027, the companies said. It is their second project they’ve worked on, following the 92.5MW/231MWh Metelen project. Both are in North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous state in Germany. Hoexter was developed in-house by SMA Solar Technology AG subsidary SMA Altenso, which does renewables project development, system integration and construction. SMA Altenso will deliver a turnkey solution for Hoexter of development, construction, and maintenance, as it is doing with Metelen. Optimiser Entrix will trade the Metelen projectin Germany’s energy and ancillary service markets, an announcement that coincided with the inauguralEnergy Storage Summit Germany 2025,held in June by our publisher Solar Media in Stuttgart. That project should come online before the end of the year. “Battery energy storage systems are essential for bridging supply gaps during periods of low renewable generation and in facilitating the greater integration of renewable energy into the grid. With the projects in Hoexter and Metelen, we are laying the foundation for our battery storage platform in Europe.” said Dominik Damaschke, head of illiquid assets equity at MEAG. The Hoexter project will be among the first to use SMA’s ‘next-generation’ SMA Sunny Central Storage UP-S inverters, which incorporate silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET technology. That means outstanding energy conversion efficiency, low acoustic emissions, and advanced operational lifetime, SMA claimed. The news coincides with other companies launching construction on smaller grid-scale projects in Germany. System integrator Intilion has been contracted by utility Baternwerk Natur to provide a 15MW/30MWh BESS for a project in Pfaffenhofen, Bavaria, southern Germany. Thepair have already worked on projects together in Germany, as reported byEnergy-Storage.news. BESS developer-operator Green Flexibility meanwhile will build a 2.5-hour, 10MW/25MWh BESS in Krumbach, also in Bavaira, with an investment of around €10 million (US$11.6 million). It will be deployed in a ‘grid-neutral’ way, Green Flexibility said.Energy-Storage.newsinterviewed CEO Christoph Ostermann forESN Premiumearlier this year.",

    "full_text": "European Commission (EC) funding is supporting a project to integrate battery storage at a pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) plant in Slovakia. The European Union (EU) executive and legislative arm highlighted this week (25 August) that €2.1 million (US$2.44 million) funding is being used for the project, which assesses how best to hybridise the 735MW Cierny Vah PHES plant with a battery energy storage system (BESS) and modernise two of the facility’s six units. The effort is being funded through the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) for Energy, the EU programme to implement Trans-European Networks for Energy policy. It aims to support investments in new cross-border energy infrastructure and upgrades to existing infrastructure. ‘Modernisation of Pumped Hydroelectric Energy Storage in Cierny Vah’ was designated a Project of Common Interest (PCI). It began in October 2024, coordinated by Slovenske Elektrarne, Slovakia’s biggest electricity utility. The state owns 34% of Slovenske Elektrarne, and Slovak Power Holdings, a joint venture between Czech power company EPH and Italy-headquartered Enel, owns the remaining 66%. However, EPH is expected to buy out Enel’s share during this year. The EC said this week that over the next two years, preparation will be made for converting two pumped turbine units to variable-speed turbines, which will improve Cierny Vah’s operational efficiency. At the same time, the optimal configuration and design integration for a BESS of up to 80MW/160MWh will be studied. These studies are expected to define technical specifications for hybridising the PHES plant, from market simulations and financial assessments to detailed technical design of components and control systems. Slovenske Elektrarne has called the project SE Integrator, noting that the need for it arises from the growing share of variable renewable energy (VRE) on the grid. This results in short-term fluctuations, which batteries can help solve, as well as longer-term mismatches between renewable production and grid demand, e.g., daytime solar vs the evening peak. The project will enter the Final Investment Decision (FID) phase upon the conclusion of the EC-funded studies. The European Commission said that in addition to balancing the Slovakian grid, balancing energy could be exported and traded with neighbouring countries such as Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. Various projects involving the hybrid integration of batteries to run-of-river hydroelectric generation facilities have been carried out, are ongoing or are planned around the world, including projects in thePhilippines,Bulgaria,Germanyand other regions. The direct pairing of long-duration energy storage (LDES) pumped hydro with battery storage appears to be a much rarer concept so far, although developersSENS and Callio in Finland announced a project early last year which would combine the two, along with solar PV generation at a decommissioned mine.",

    "full_text": "“Australia is one of the leading countries for grid-forming inverters,” said Natalie Thompson, senior analyst of energy storage and solar at Wood Mackenzie, when discussing the Australian energy storage market. Talking on the ‘Tripling Operational Capacity—Unlocking Market Opportunities and Grid Stability with Grid-Forming BESS’ panel discussion at the Battery Asset Management Summit Australia 2025, Thompson noted that the country is leading in grid-forming inverter deployment, with many other countries not yet considering using the technology. “For Australia, for our population size, we have a pretty world-leading uptake of utility-scale renewables and storage. We are also one of the leading countries in terms of having systems with grid-forming inverters in the next few years,” Thompson notes. “Some countries globally haven’t considered integrating grid-forming as part of their batch of deployments. Grid-forming is very nascent in certain parts of the world, but in Australia, it can be a really interesting use case for other countries.” Grid-forming BESS differs from traditional battery storage systems in its ability to actively stabilise the grid by mimicking the behaviour of synchronous generators. These systems are designed to support thegrid’s operational continuity and ensure uninterrupted power supply, even during grid outages. They often set their own internal voltage waveform reference and can synchronise with the grid or operate independently of other generation sources. This makes them ideal for maintaining system strength in a renewables-dominated grid. One key aspect of a grid-forming BESS is its ability to provide synthetic inertia to maintain the grid’s frequency. Coal, gas, and hydropower plants have traditionally provided this inertia to the grid. However, with the impending withdrawal of coal-fired power, attention has been diverted to emerging technologies that could replace this, such as grid-forming battery storage or synchronous condensers. Examples of grid-forming BESS in Australia include the likes of French independent power producer (IPP)Neoen’s 540MWh Western Downs stage one BESS in Queensland, Australian energy majorAGL Energy’s 2,000MWh Tomago BESS in New South Wales, and specialist infrastructure investorSosteneo’s 370MWh Koorangie BESS in Victoria. During the panel discussion, Thompson also noted the impact data centres are likely to have on electricity demand in countries across the globe and the opportunity that could arise for energy storage. “Globally, we’ve seen some jurisdictions where data centres will represent around 10% of demand, which is quite significant when you see where it is today. Australia is on a bit of a slower trajectory at the moment, but I think that will change rapidly,” Thompson said. The growth indata centresand AI will “transform the global energy sector”, resulting in a surge in energy demand in the next decade. According to a report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), global electricity demand from data centres is set to more than double by 2030 to more than 945TWh annually. This will be driven by demand from “AI-optimised data centres,” which is set to more than quadruple in the same period. Energy storage is being touted as one of the technologies that could help facilitate the uptake of data centres worldwide. For instance, earlier this month, engineering equipment manufacturer Caterpillar announced itwould deploy a combined heat and power (CHP) plant featuring more than a gigawatt-hour of batteries for a new data centre complex in Utah, US, while yesterday,Energy-Storage.newsreported on plans for gigawatt-scale private grid solutions from three developers in the US,each featuring batteries alongside other technologies like nuclear, gas and solar PV. Representing the Energy Corporation of New South Wales (EnergyCo) on the panel discussion was Phil Bratby, executive project director, who commented on theSystem Integrity Protection Scheme (SIPS)for the world’s most powerful BESS: the 850MW/1,680MWh Waratah Super Battery. “Ultimately, the SIPS scheme allows the existing transmission lines to be run harder, essentially, by using up some of the contingent capacity that would be reserved in those power lines,” Bratby said. “That allows us to get more generation from the renewable energy generators, which are located regionally, typically into the load centre, which is Sydney, Newcastle, etc.” The SIPS contract for the Waratah Super Battery is widely recognised as the largest of its kind in Australia. It enables Transgrid to send signals to the BESS to inject energy into the grid while simultaneously instructing paired generators to adjust their output. Specifically, the SIPS Control System can monitor 36 transmission lines in real time and respond instantaneously to system events. This dynamic balancing act prevents disruptions and allows existing transmission infrastructure to operate at higher capacities, effectively “running harder” without compromising reliability. In an exclusive interview withESN Premium, Nick Carter, the CEO of Akaysha Energy, the developer of the Waratah Super Battery, noted thatenabling the first half of the SIPS was “a massive amount of work” despite its relatively simple nature. “It all sounds straightforward, but the actual implementation of it, and doing it at the speed at which we need to do it, in conjunction with the grid connection, in conjunction with the control system, across 288 inverters at a massive site, is really, really hard for a single connection point,” Carter toldESN Premium. Bratby added that the Waratah Super Battery’s functionality means it can still participate in energy arbitrage; however, its true value will be unlocking cheap variable renewable energy generation on the grid. “The Waratah Super Battery can still trade in the arbitrage market; there’s still the ability, depending on different times of the year, we trade different amounts of that battery,” Bratby said. “But the large benefit is towards unlocking that cheap renewable energy generation, such as solar and wind, that would have been constrained otherwise, and getting that into the load centre to make sure that we’ve got enough energy to supply the needs. This brings prices down, because that’s often-displacing gas heating plants and things like that.” Our publisher, Solar Media, will host theEnergy Storage Summit Asia 2025on 7-8 October 2025 in Manila, the Philippines.

    "full_text": "Renewables developer and independent power producer (IPP) TagEnergy has acquired Australian developer ACE Power, adding 6GW of energy storage and renewables projects to its portfolio. The integration of ACE Power’s portfolio will create a combined portfolio exceeding 10GW across Australia. The deal brings a 27-strong development team into the TagEnergy fold, taking the company’s total Australian staff to more than 60. Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed. Still, the acquisition comes after ACE Power’s majority owner, investment firm Pelion Green Future, sought capital to grow the business earlier this year and planned to sell its 80% stake. TagEnergy said it had also acquired the remaining 20% stake from several minority stakeholders, completing a full acquisition of ACE Power. Battery energy storage system (BESS) projects are prominent in the acquisition strategy. TagEnergy confirmed that it plans to prioritise battery storage developments from both companies’ portfolios in the immediate term. TagEnergy will likely focus its efforts on completing the second stage of the 1,333MW Golden Plains wind plant in Victoria, while simultaneously developing its own 150MW/600MWh Golden Plains BESS later this year. The acquisition brings several significant battery storage projects into TagEnergy’s portfolio, includingACE Power’s 900MW/3,600MWh Neboand500MW/2,000MWh Raglan battery energy storage projectsin the Isaac and Gladstone regions of Queensland, respectively. Both of these projects recently securedEnvironment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Actapproval. ACE Power is also looking to develop a1,000MW/8,000MWh BESS in New South Wales, named the Eastern Hub Firming Battery. It is being pursued in the Northern Tablelands region, near Salisbury Plains, approximately 11km southeast of Uralla and 465km north of Sydney. These large-scale battery storage projects align with TagEnergy’s growing focus on storage solutions. At the end of last year, the companylaunched construction of what it claims will be France’s largest BESS when it’s complete: a 240MW/480MWh system being built in the commune of Cernay-lès-Reims, in the department of Marnes. The currentlargest BESS in France was brought online earlier this month by developer Harmony Energy. The 100MW/200MWh Cheviré BESS is located at the port of Nantes Saint-Nazaire Harbour and is claimed to be the first large-scale 2-hour duration BESS in France by Harmony Energy. TagEnergy CEO Franck Woitiez said Australia is one of the most exciting and promising places in the world to deliver the energy transition, whilst emphasising that ACE Power’s early-stage development experience will help TagEnergy capitalise on this opportunity. “We’re integrating ACE Power’s deep expertise in early-stage development with our capabilities in commercialisation, delivery and long-term investment, underpinned by a clear energy management strategy that focuses on delivering greater value for the market, our customers and partners,” Woitiez said. “ACE Power has built a strong reputation as an agile and trusted local developer, and we’re thrilled to welcome their talented team into TagEnergy.” ACE Power founder and managing director Andy Scullion will lead TagEnergy’s development function in Australia. Current head of development Théo Imbert will move into a new strategy and integration role. For TagEnergy, White & Case provided legal counsel on the transaction, while EY delivered tax and financial advisory services. Aurecon conducted technical due diligence, and Willis Towers Watson and BMS handled insurance matters jointly. Premier Strategy advised on the deal’s community engagement aspects.

    "full_text": "We catch up with the CEO of BESS developer Harmony Energy about its strategy and plans going forward, following the sale of its affiliated Harmony Energy Income Trust (HEIT). The firm was one of the early movers in the UK battery energy storage system (BESS) market, at one time having thetwo largest operational projects in Europe, at 100MW/200MWh each. Those are part of an eight-project portfolio totalling 395.4MW/790.8MWh of capacity which sits withinHarmony Energy Income Trust (HEIT), a listed vehicle set up by Harmony Energy as investment advisor, which had first refusal on the projects Harmony Energy developed and sold in the UK. Following a period of falling UK revenues for BESS,HEIT and other BESS funds saw their valuations plummet and dividends scrapped. HEIT was subsequently sold (and de-listed) to investor Foresight Group, for an enterprise value representing a 94% premium to its share price when it announced it was undergoing a sales process. Harmony Energy continues to provide asset management services for the portfolio. Alongside this, Harmony Energy has been expanding abroad, recentlyenergising France’s largest BESSand developing a large pipeline inPoland,Germanyand Italy. CEO Peter Kavanagh talks us through the process and the strategy going forward in this interview. “The HEIT sale proved what we were saying about the net asset value (the NAV, which the market cap was lower than) and has given us credibility in the market, and solid foundations to grow the business privately,” Kavanagh says. “The sale proved private investors were willing to be more patient, and pay a higher price for assets.” “We’re going to raise funds in September for our significant pipeline, with 14GW at different stages of development, and 1GW ready-to-build in the UK and aiming for 3GW built across Europe in the next five years.” That will be a roughly £300 million (US$403.5 million) fundraise run by JLL which, combined with debt, will go towards building out that pipeline. Harmony Energy will effectively continue as it has done previously, developing, building and operating BESS projects which will be owned by an institutional investment firm, he explains, but this time it will be private capital. “We’ll be selling down equity in the Harmony Topco, so the investor coming in will be taking on some development risk, whereas HEIT was just a yield play. But that also meant investors weren’t accessing the full value of the BESS lifecycle. You’ll have more upside potential than a listed vehicle,” Kavanagh says. Positives around the experience with HEIT include the ability to raise debt and also winning friends with how it ran the fund, Kavanagh says. “We structured our management fee against the share price rather than the NAV. So we absolutely did the right thing for shareholders, but we hadn’t foreseen such a sharp movement in the share price versus the NAV, which was very painful at times.” Harmony energised a 100MW/200MWh project called Cheviré at the port of Nantes Saint-Nazaire Harbour in Franceearlier in August.An outside investor provided construction financing and the firm will now do a refinancing for that, and it has two other projects in France going to build ‘shortly’, another 150MW of capacity. “We wanted to keep that momentum up. We could have waited for an equity check to come in but decided to bring it online early. France is not as well known but it is a very strong market, it’s just not as deep, but if you can get assets online early there are very valuable revenue streams to be captured,” Kavanagh explains. Ancillary service prices are are very attractive right now, he adds, with a good few years left before the need to revert to day-ahead and arbitrage markets. “We’ve always gone for slightly longer duration, to build something that will stand up in the deeper markets.” In Poland, Harmonyrecently sold a 200MW BESS to EDFbut is also taking projects into construction to own and operate. Echoing Harmony Energy Poland’s executive director Michal Maćkowiak, Kavanagh says that the firm is putting less weight onto the country’s capacity market (CM), said to be the bedrock of the business case for storage in Poland. “Poland is one of those markets where the developer margins are trading lower than everyone expected. We think you drive value by building, owning and operating. I think people put a lot of weight on the CM, relying on a single revenue stream heavily. We attribute less weight to that, going for a 2-hour system, we believe that is the optimum size given capex and revenue projections,” he says. “It is a tough market in terms of developing. It took basically 12 months to secure grid connections, and now that market is very locked up in terms of grid. The ones we’ve got are great, and it’s quite hard to develop new sites beyond those.” In Germany, said by many to be the ‘hottest market’ for storage in Europe right now, Harmony is in the process of selling a shovel-ready site. “Our strategy is to build as much as we can, but also by selling one project in each country, that provides us a very valuable data point going into fundraising process, puts cash back in to the business,” says Kavanagh. “In Germany alone we have 2.9GW which should become shovel-ready by end of next year, mainly 300MW sites, we’ve taken the approach of going large early-on. The market is seeing really high revenues and very high floor levels from tier 1 offtakers.” Italy is another market drawing a lot of interest, but the firm is about a year away from having shovel-ready projects meaning it will miss out onthis year’s MACSE auction, which is expected to kick off Italy’s grid-scale storage market. “It’s all about finding the right team and partners on the ground. In France and Germany we were lucky that we knew people already. Italy has been attractive for a while, I don’t feel we’ve missed the opportunity but we’re certainly further behind than where we are in those other markets.” The topic of tolls and contracted revenues has already come up a few times in the conversation, but what is Kavanagh’s overall approach to this versus going merchant? “As a group in the UK, we’ve been sort of more excited about trading merchant risk because there’s more upside as we’ve seen. Now you have these floors coming in at higher levels that’s really helps open up the market to that capital not comfortable with that merchant risk. Really interesting when you hear about the really high debt levels, sometimes north of 80%,” Kavanagh says. “I’ve always been passionate about going merchant as I believe in the upside. But we’ve grown to a size where you should hedge your bets, and I think we’ll split something like 50% merchant and 50% floors and tolling. The tolling side is interesting but that market is only of a certain size.” “From a strategic point of view we are planning mainly merchant, but we’ll definitely utilise a toll or floor offer if it’s attractive.” Harmony has mainly used Tesla for its BESS projects to-date but has started to diversify,enlisting Envision Energy for the final two UK projects that made up the eight-project portfoliowhen they went online in late 2024. “A few years back we realised we need to diversify, to get most attractive pricing and to keep everyone hot-to-trot. We ran with Envision for those two HEIT projects and they’ve been a great provider. We tendered out to nine different providers, narrowed the field down, and we will look to tender out into the market going forward. Ideally, you want a number of suppliers.” “The attraction of tesla is how they deliver across the whole piece. When doing multiple projects it really shows who stands up and delivers, but there are some great Tier 1 providers out there.” Kavanagh’s Poland colleagues Piotr Czembor and Michal Maćkowiak will both be speaking at our publisher Solar Media’sEnergy Storage Summit Central Eastern Europe (CEE) 2025in a month’s time in Warsaw, Poland, on 23-24 September.",

    "full_text": "Three companies, Pacifico Energy, Zenith Volts, and Fermi America have begun expanding power generation and energy storage capabilities for US data centre development. In a February guest blog forEnergy-Storage.news,William Derasmo, partner at US law firm Troutman Pepper Locke, noted that data centres are expected to account for 9% of the US power demand in five years’ time. According to the2025 State of Reliability report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), approximately 1,500 MW of data centres were disconnected simultaneously and unexpectedly from the bulk electric system (BES) in 2024 due to a transmission line fault. Such a significant load loss is comparable to a large nuclear power plant suddenly coming online, resulting in an imbalance due to excess system generation. Due to the rapid construction of data centres, there is a need for generation and storage assets to keep pace. Pacifico, Zenith and Fermi are all taking unique approaches to this issue, each involving the pairing of battery energy storage systems (BESS) with other generation and storage technologies. One other key similarity is the large amounts of land used in all three projects, which allows for future scaling. One approach may prove better, but time will ultimately tell. Japanese renewable energy developer Pacifico Energy has announced plans for its GW Ranch Project, an off-grid power generation campus combining a total of 5GW of gas turbines and battery storage to support hyperscale data centres in Texas, US. GW Ranch aims to deliver 1GW of power in 2028 and 5GW in 2030. The project will have 5GW of dedicated off-grid capacity powered by natural gas and 1.8GW of energy storage. In development since early 2024, GW Ranch is sited within over 8,000 acres in Pecos County, Texas, and will take an “off-grid approach” to “bypass grid interconnection delays and regulatory bottlenecks.” As Pacifico states, the project has started the permitting process with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). It is set to meet all environmental regulatory requirements, and has the support of local officials. Pacifico highlights that the project will be used for AI infrastructure and other power-intensive industries. Since GW Ranch is not connected to the grid, it will allow data centre operators to launch and scale quickly. GW Ranch is also expected to create thousands of construction jobs, generate local tax revenue, and drive long-term investment in regional infrastructure and the community. Constantyn Gieskes, Vice President at Pacifico Energy, said of GW Ranch: “Every aspect of the project has been designed to solve problems with the status quo in data center development. By building off-grid and working hand-in-hand with local officials, we’re delivering the speed, reliability, and responsible development that our customers and communities both demand.” In June, independent power producer (IPP)CleanCapital acquired a 27MW solar and 25MWh battery storage portfolio across Massachusetts and California, from Pacifico. Data centre construction company Zenith Volts has been approved by the Chaves County Commission for a “state-of-the-art” 300-acre data centre project near Roswell, New Mexico. The project is designed to support 1.25GW or more of power capacity with expandable land resources and is expected to be operational by November 2027. According to Zenith, the approved 8,500-acre site will integrate solar, natural gas generators, modular solar-thermal hybrid systems, a 250-acre battery energy storage system (BESS) and geothermal cooling for efficiency. The data centre will support over 600 server racks with 1.25GW or more capacity and expandable land for future growth. The company says the project will create 140 full-time jobs and position Chaves County as a technology and energy hub. Zenith is headquartered in Cheyenne, Wyoming and is looking for technology companies, cloud service providers and “AI innovators” to join as anchor partners in shaping the facility’s computing needs. Fermi America, in partnership with the Texas Tech University (TTU) System, is working with construction firms Parkhill and Lee Lewis to create a private grid supporting AI energy consumption. Lee Lewis and Parkhill are joining a team of experts to develop the 11GW private grid in Amarillo, Texas. Parkhill will design infrastructure solutions to integrate with Fermi’s expansion plans and Lee Lewis will build and manage the site. Fermi was co-founded by former US Energy Secretary Rick Perry. In addition to energy storage, solar power, and natural gas, the company is looking to include new nuclear power at the site. When initially announcing Fermi and TTU’s partnership, the company said it was answering US president Donald Trump’s “call to deliver global energy and AI dominance.” The administration has taken a strong stance on supporting AI development in the US, with the president issuing executive orders such as the ‘Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence’ order. The president has also offered broad support for nuclear power, with the ‘Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security’ executive order. Fermi positions itself as all-in on the president’s commitments to these technologies. Others in the government, such as US Congressman Ronny Jackson, though positioning the project in a sort of Cold War familiarity against China, believe Fermi and TTU will begin a “new chapter of high-impact investment in the Texas Panhandle.” Aside from energy production, Fermi says the partnership will greatly improve the TTU System and advance its mission through academic and research opportunities, as well as workforce training and placement initiatives. Geotechnical work has already begun on the campus, which is expected to deliver 1GW of online power by the end of 2026.",

    "full_text": "Chinese solar PV inverter and energy storage provider Sungrow has announced two major developments: plans for a Hong Kong IPO and the release of its half-year 2025 interim report. On the evening of 25 August, Sungrow announced that it had held its 18th meeting of the fifth board of directors, during which relevant proposals regarding the proposed issuance of H-shares and listing on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited were reviewed and approved. According to the announcement, the company plans to issue overseas-listed foreign shares (H-shares) and apply for listing on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. This initiative aims to deepen its global strategic footprint, enhance its international brand image, build diversified financing channels, and thereby strengthen its core competitiveness. H-shares are issued for firms based in mainland China and listed on the Hong Kong exchange, regulated by Chinese law but denominated in Hong Kong Dollars, enabling Chinese firms to tap broader sources of financing. As previously reported byESN Premium, since the second half of last year, a wave of companies inChina’s energy storage industry have been seeking listings on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. These include players across the industry chain, such as CATL, Sunwoda, BYD, CALB, REPT Battero, Hithium, and Sigenergy. At the same time, Sungrow also disclosed its 2025 interim report. According to the report, from January to June 2025, Sungrow recorded operating revenue of RMB43.533 billion (US$6.09 billion), a year-on-year increase of 40.34%. Net profit attributable to shareholders of the listed company stood at RMB7.735 billion, a year-on-year increase of 55.97%. Its profitability was remarkable, with both revenue and net profit hitting record highs since the company’s listing. The report highlighted the explosive growth in Sungrow’s energy storage business in the first half of the year, with revenue amounting to RMB17.803 billion, a surge of 127.78% year-on-year. During this period, the company launched the PowerTitan 3.0 AC Smart Storage Platform, with the Plus version offering a capacity of up to 12.5MWh, cementing its position as one of the largest energy storage systems in the industry. In the inverter segment, Sungrow generated revenue of RMB15.327 billion, a year-on-year increase of 17.06%. In the first half of the year, the company launched the world’s first 400kW+ string inverter, the SG465HX, and the world’s first split modular inverter, the 1+X 2.0. Behind the impressive performance, two notable shifts have taken place in Sungrow’s business. First, in terms of revenue share, the company’s largest business segment has shifted from PV inverters to energy storage systems, accounting for 35.21% and 40.89% of its total revenue respectively. At the end of 2024, these proportions were 37.41% and 32.06% respectively. Second, overseas business has grown rapidly. Revenue from overseas markets now surpasses that from the Chinese mainland, accounting for 58.30% and 41.70% of total revenue respectively. As of the end of 2024, these proportions were 46.64% and 53.38% respectively. Market research and analysis firm Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables found that Sungrow was the leading energy storage system integrator by market share during 2024 in Europe and the Middle East and second in North America, the Asia-Pacific region, and overall global rankings. According to the annual system integrator market landscape report issued by Wood Mackenzie a few weeks ago,Sungrow doubled its market share in Europe year-on-year. Overall, the market is seeing “tense competition” globally, Wood Mackenzie analyst Kevin Shang toldEnergy-Storage.news.",

    "full_text": "Vertically integrated battery storage manufacturer Hithium will supply two projects in Saudi Arabia with ‘the world’s first mass-produced kiloampere-hour (kAh) cells’. The Chinese manufacturer said this morning that Saudi Electricity Company (SEC), the country’s biggest utility, has awarded it a contract to deploy battery energy storage system (BESS) solutions across two sites in the northern provinces of Tabuk and Hail. Hithium is partnered with Saudi-headquartered engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm Alfanar Projects to deliver the projects. The capacity of individual projects was not disclosed; the two’s total energy storage capacity will be 4GWh. Megawatt output was also undisclosed. Hithium did reveal, however, that the project will use the1175Ah lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells that the company began mass producing earlier this yearat its facility in Chongqing, central China. The cells will be integrated into Hithium’s ∞Power 6.25MWh Desert Eagle, a BESS enclosure specially designed to withstand harsh desert conditions. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia targets 50% of its electricity coming from renewable sources by 2030, necessitating 48GWh of energy storage. The contract for Hithium follows Saudi Electricity Company signing a12.5GWh order with rival Chinese maker BYDin February, afterthe successful delivery of the 2.6GWh Bisha BESS project. Hithium launched its desert-specific BESS solution at an event in October last year. The system is designed to be reliable in operation at temperatures from -30°C to 60°C due to multi-layer insulation, which reduces its internal temperature by up to 10°C. Fully sealed components are designed to protect against sandstorms, while automated dust alerts lessen the need for maintenance and the company claims durable components have been selected that are rated for more than 40,000 hours of continuous operation. The Chinese manufacturer also said in launching the product last year that it will build aBESS factory in Saudi Arabia with 5GWh annual production capacity through Hithium MANAT, a joint venture with Saudi engineering solutions company MANAT. The company claims to have made breakthroughs in design and manufacturing techniques that enabled it to make cells three times bigger than the 314Ah cells commonly integrated into large-scale BESS solutions. That appears to put Hithium ahead of its peers in China. Major manufacturers of batteries for energy storage applications exhibiting at this year’s SNEC industry event in May showcased larger-format battery cells, butwhile 500Ah appeared to be a new standard and 600Ah+ cells an outlier pursued by a handful of players, Hithium has the head start on kiloampere-hour cells, which it said can effectively perform long-duration energy storage (LDES) applications. Increasing sizes of battery cell and commensurate improvements in energy density areamong the main drivers of cost reduction from a technology perspective, BloombergNEF (BNEF) analyst Isshu Kikuma told ESN Premium earlier this year.",

    "full_text": "“Battery energy storage systems (BESS) typically change ownership between two and four times during their 40-year lifecycle,” John Sheehy, CEO of Pottinger, said on day two of the Battery Asset Management Summit Australia 2025 this morning. Discussing asset management on the ‘M&A and Engaging the Investor’ panel discussion, Sheehy of investment advisory firm Pottinger also noted that mergers and acquisitions (M&A) play an “incredibly important role” in the deployment of BESS. “M&A is really important in shifting the profile from a cost of capital, from a risk profile as you move through the development stages and into operations and through the life of the battery,” Sheehy added. Paul Peters, CEO of the New South Wales Energy Security Corporation (ESC), whichlaunched at the start of July, and Alexander Austin, CEO of Infradebt, also participated in the panel discussion. The ESC was established under the Energy Security Corporation Act 2024. According to itsofficial website, the organisation will invest between AU$25 million (US$16.25 million) and AU$150 million per project. It has been armed with an initial funding allocation of AU$1 billion and an investment mandate that focuses on short – to long-duration energy storage (LDES) projects. Peters emphasised the need for longer-duration energy storage in New South Wales to maintain grid reliability amid growing concerns that the state will likelyexperience grid-reliability issues in 2027-28 without intervention. “Of the 14 battery projects in the state today, 11 of them are two hours. That’s not enough duration, so we’re very focused on longer duration, such as four hours, eight hours, and getting some momentum into the market for those to get close, but to get to operation,” Peters added. The state’s ESC will result in an overall expansion of private sector renewable energy investment in New South Wales, similar to how theCommonwealth’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC)has expanded total renewable energy investment across Australia. In addition to these factors, Austin believes that it is not only possible to go 100% merchant with a BESS without input from initiatives such as the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS), which has a revenue floor and cap, but the organisation is already delivering these. “We have done several pure merchant BESS projects. We created a specialist battery debt fund with the unfortunate acronym of ETF: the Energy Transition Fund,” Austin begins. “ETF was created to provide debt finance to predominantly merchant batteries. We do everything from full merchant to 50/50; it’s here. That’s part of what we see as our niche in the market.” Our publisher, Solar Media, will host theEnergy Storage Summit Asia 2025on 7-8 October 2025 in Manila, the Philippines.

    "full_text": "IPP Neoen has enlisted BESS supplier NHOA Energy for its first energy storage project in Italy. NHOA Energy will supply Neoen with the battery energy storage system (BESS) technology for the 10MW/51MWh ‘Broni Battery’ project, in the province of Pavia, Northern Italy. The project has a 15-year Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (or capacity market) contract awarded by transmission system operator (TSO) Terna in the December 2024 auction, for delivery from Q1 2026. The auction cleared at €56,000 (US$65,000) per MW of ‘probability-weighted’ power per year, NHOA toldEnergy-Storage.news,referring to what is more commonly known as a de-rating factor. Four-hour BESS have a 67% de-rating factor, meaning the de-rated or probability-weighted capacity of the Broni project contract is 7MW. The successive auction for 2027 delivery was held in February 2025 and cleared at €47k/MW/year. The business case for grid-scale energy storage in Italy looks set to be driven by the capacity market in the North of Italy and the MACSE scheme (Meccanismo di Approvvigionamento di Capacità di Stoccaggio Elettrico) in the South/Central regions of the country. Both provide 15 years of contracted revenues. The capacity market, where contract holders are obligated to bid in the day-ahead and ancillary services markets, may make up 30-40% of BESS project revenues, according to some estimates. The first MACSE auctions will run at the end of September. Winning projects’ capacity will effectively be handed over to Terna for use in a time-shifting platform serving renewable asset owners, and projects in MACSE will derive up to 80% of their revenues from it, analysts estimate. Together, the two schemes should enable the commissioning by early 2028 of at least 20GWh of BESS capacity in Italy. Terna is targeting 50GWh of new energy storage by 2030. However, one developer-operator weinterviewed recently forESN Premiumreckoned that target might be overly ambitious. BESS will also play in the country’s ancillary service markets, although its future role providing grid-forming services like voltage control and inertia is uncertain following Terna’s self-procurement of substantial synchronous condenser capacity. Though it’s gone through several changes of ownership and name, NHOA was originally founded in Italy in 2005 as Electro Power Systems (EPS), before being acquired by utility and power firm Engie, which then sold it to Taiwan Cement Corporation (TCC),a deal which completed in late 2024. NHOA therefore has plenty of experience in the Italian energy storage market, recentlyworking on 39MWhand50MWh projects for customers. While it is Neoen’s first BESS in Italy, the Brookfield-owned independent power producer (IPP) is highly active in the energy storage market elsewhere. We’ve recently reported on its projects inCanada,Australia,Finland,SwedenandGermany.",

    "full_text": "Governor of New Jersey, US, Phil Murphy, has signed legislation to reach 2,000MW of energy storage capacity by 2030 and nearly double the state’s clean energy capacity. Legislation A5267/S4289 introduces a transmission-scale energy storage incentive programme, aiming to meet New Jersey’s target of 2,000MW of energy storage by 2030. This initiative seeks to expedite the installation of new clean energy capacity and lower costs for New Jersey’s energy customers. Under S4530/A5768, the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) will launch registration for an additional 3,000MW of community solar projects on 1 October 2025. The governor’s office says this move will significantly expand New Jersey’s solar initiatives, enabling families and businesses to reduce their monthly electric bills. These pieces of legislation enable the rapid expansion of New Jersey’s community solar programme and the swift creation of new energy storage facilities. Under the Murphy Administration, solar PV generation capacity has increased from 2.4GW to 5.2GW, with solar now powering over 600,000 homes. The governor’s office claims that rising energy costs in the state result from mismanagement by the regional grid operator, PJM. Murphy has also called for a formal investigation “into the energy cost crisis facilitated by PJM,” announced US$430 million in direct relief for New Jersey ratepayers, sent a bipartisan letter demanding transparency and oversight from PJM, and signed legislation increasing public accountability from grid operators. In June,the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) approved the first phase of the Garden State Energy Storage Programme (GSESP). At the time, the NJBPU noted that the speed at which energy storage systems (ESS) can be built is crucial, as the state cannot build “traditional” power plants within five years due to supply chain issues. Senator Smith, Chair of the Senate Energy Committee, said of the legislation: “By incentivising and procuring the creation of transmission-scale energy storage, we will enable a wider application of clean energy that can charge and store energy at low-cost hours then discharge at high-cost, high-demand hours, thus lowering overall costs and smoothing demand spikes on the grid.” Smith continued, “This legislation will help keep New Jersey at the forefront of investments in new, clean energy technology, even as the current federal administration seeks to sabotage our environment and our renewable future.”",

    "full_text": "After an initial rush to deploy megawatts that gave CAISO and ERCOT the lead in US BESS adoption, both markets have become focused on capacity and availability, writes Amit Mathrani of Rabobank Americas. This is an extract of a feature article that originally appeared inVol.43 of PV Tech Power, Solar Media’s quarterly journal covering the solar and storage industries. Every edition includes ‘Storage & Smart Power’, a dedicated section contributed by the Energy-Storage.news team,and full access to upcoming issues as well as the 10-year back catalogue is included as part of a subscription toEnergy-Storage.news Premium. Battery energy storage has sprinted from niche experiment to indispensable grid asset in barely half a decade. Nowhere is that transformation clearer than in California and Texas. By the end of 2024, the California ISO (CAISO) operated 12.5GW of utility-scale battery capacity, up from just 1GW in 2020, while the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) surged from essentially 0.5GW to 10GW over the same period. Together, these two markets now host a little more than 65% of all US grid-connected battery storage capacity (see Figure 1 below). The similarities end with scale. CAISO’s build-out has been propelled by policy mandates and long-term Resource Adequacy (RA) contracts that favour 4-hour duration, close to urban load centres. ERCOT’s boom, by contrast, has unfolded in a pure merchant setting, with no capacity market, minimal regulatory guardrails, and revenues earned (or lost) in real-time energy and ancillary service markets. The result is a dual stress test on the same technology. California now grapples with revenue compression and interconnection logjams, Texas with price cannibalisation, transmission bottlenecks, and a push towards multi-hour discharge. These contrasts preview the grid’s next chapter. Duration is edging out volume, siting advantage now beats speed, and investors increasingly prize fluency with evolving policy rules and flawless operations. Other ISOs – PJM, MISO, NYISO – are already importing elements of both playbooks. To see where battery economics and grid planning are headed next, let’s start with California and Texas. California and Texas share the same headline: double-digit-gigawatt battery fleets built in record time. However, the mechanics behind that growth could not be further apart. CAISO’s 12.5GW of operating BESS is the product of a policy-catalysed glide path: mid-term reliability mandates such as the California Public Utilities Commission’s (CPUC) 15.5GW of clean capacity by 2027, a 4-hour resource adequacy standard that underpins long-term offtake contracts, and interconnection reforms that now screen projects for site control and deliverability before they enter detailed study. By Contrast, ERCOT’s 10GW of operating capacity has been built almost entirely without mandates, capacity payments, or federal oversight. Early projects were mostly 1-hour systems chasing ancillary service revenue. Currently, the fleet averages 1.5-2 hours, and the queue mix is expected to shift toward 4-hour duration ahead of the Dispatchable Reliability Reserve Service (DRRS) launch in ERCOT in 2026 to compensate resources that can provide at least four hours of continuous energy during emergency conditions, supporting system stability without requiring formal capacity obligations. For investors, the divergence frames a strategic spectrum: from California’s contract-anchored, lower-beta returns to Texas’s volatility-driven, higher-beta upside. Understanding where a new market will sit on that spectrum is now the opening question in any storage diligence process. Batteries that earn today sit where the grid needs relief – nodes defined by congestion, scarcity and price spikes. Interconnection headroom and transmission topology decide which projects reach commercial operation and which languish in restudy, with no developer enthusiasm. Southern California still remains attractive to battery storage developers. As of April 2025, SP-15 hosts more than 51GW of storage requests, over three times the capacity queued in either ZP-26 or NP-15. The sheer weight of applications has forced CAISO to rewrite its interconnection rulebook. In response to FERC’s Order 2023, CAISO’s May 2025 tariff amendment now requires every new requester to prove 90% site control on Day One and 100% before signing a Large Generator Interconnection Agreement [1, 2]. Projects that miss the market drop to the back of the line. A parallel reform introduces a screening stage that ranks projects on viability and alignment with state resource plans before they enter full study. History justifies the clampdown. As Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s (LBNL’s)Queued Up 2024survey showed, only 12% of CAISO requests submitted between 2000 and 2018 reached commercial operation, the lowest build rate among US ISOs. Each late-stage withdrawal triggers restudies that delay the rest of the cluster, raising carrying costs and eroding tax-credit timing. Investors now treat queue position and deliverability status as hard diligence gates, equal to offtake strength. Transmission headroom is equally selective. CAISO’s 2024-2025 Transmission Plan identifies US$4.8 billion in upgrades, but most come online after 2029, leaving near-term projects exposed to local congestion, especially around solar-heavy Kern and Fresno counties. ERCOT still moves projects from application to energisation in 18-30 months. Lightning speed by ISO standards. However, geography is beginning to narrow the fast lane. The 2024 ERCOT Constraints & Needs report lists the Tonkawa Switch – Morgan Creek 345kV path as the single most expensive constraint on the system, absorbing US$156 million in congestion rent between October 2023 and November 2024. The broader West Texas Export Interface booked US$148 million over the same period, and ERCOT’s economic forecast shows rents rising to US$178 million in 2026 without new wires. Batteries sited behind those bottlenecks often clear into the real-time market but collect a discounted nodal price. Houston, once considered congestion-proof, is not immune. Projected constraints in the North-Houston Interface reach US$46 million in annual congestion rent by 2026. ERCOT has endorsed a US$2.2 billion pipeline of upgrades, yet most will enter service after 2027, meaning today’s queue will energise into tomorrow’s pinch-points. Sponsors installing batteries on the load side of a popular constraint are starting to price nodal basis risk the way wind developers priced curtailment a decade ago. For developers and lenders, congestion risk now shapes deal terms as much as project size. Lenders are paying closer attention to site control, deliverability studies, and nodal-price hedging, knowing that a project stuck behind a constraint can miss the very spreads its model assumed. At the federal level, this year’s Independence Day celebrations brought clarity. The ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act’ left the 30% standalone storage ITC, created by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), intact through 2032 – no phase downs, no haircut. The catch is provenance. Starting in 2028, battery cells or packs with more than 30% ‘foreign entity of concern’ (FEOC) content lose the credit, and the 15% Section 301 tariff reinstated in May for Chinese lithium-ion cells remains in force. Tax equity is safe, but only for projects that can document an increasingly domestic supply chain. Policy still leaves plenty of runway for storage, but the path isn’t straight anymore. Anyone building or financing battery storage projects under these policy crosswinds now spends as much time following committee hearings and tariff dockets as they do watching price curves. The question for storage assets has shifted from, “Can the BESS project make money?” to, “Can it keep that revenue once SoC rules, outage penalties, insurance costs and degradation kick in?” Operational discipline now drives the gap between a deal that meets pro-forma and one that backpedals on covenants. CAISO has required 4-hour batteries to hold a minimum reserve going into the evening ramp. The rule was supposed to sunset in 2024; instead, the ISO extended it through 2026 while it evaluates longer-term reliability options. The extension means storage resources must hold energy through the late afternoon peak with a preset charge margin or face potential bidding restrictions and availability penalties. At the same time, availability risk is widening. CAISO’s Q4 2024 Market Issues & Performance Report shows battery outages, planned and forced, rose 26% Y-o-Y, reflecting both rapid fleet expansion and longer downtimes for fire safety retrofits. The most public reminder came on January 2025, when a thermal runaway event at Vistra’s 300MW Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility forced a three-month outage and community air-quality monitoring. While no injuries occurred, the incident hardened lender and insurer attitudes overnight. Verisk – Munich Re highlight tighter underwriting criteria for lithium projects lacking dedicated setbacks or advanced suppression. Performance penalties compound those cost pressures. In a typical CAISO 4-hour Resource Adequacy contract, a single missed dispatch during a system stress hour can forfeit an entire month of capacity payments. An outcome that now carries more weight than day-ahead spread assumptions in many debt models. Sponsors respond by investing in redundant battery-management telemetry, automated SoC forecasting, and additional fire suppression layers that push EPC budgets up by 2-3% but protect far larger revenue streams. Texas presents a different operational gauntlet. ERCOT’s merchant batteries cycle more frequently, often three to four times per day during shoulder seasons, to capture brief price spikes that still emerge between solar oversupply and evening peaks. High-cycle operation accelerates degradation. Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) packs rated at 10,000 cycles see usable energy fall below 80% of nameplate in seven years under ERCOT’s dispatch pattern, compared with ten years in CAISO’s less frenetic market, according to performance warranties filed with two recent interconnection agreements. That degradation matters because ERCOT’s forthcoming DRRS imposes a 4-hour continuous-discharge requirement. Sponsors that fall short risk losing DRRS eligibility unless they augment mid-life with new modules. In a market where spreads compress faster than projects retire, operational proof is becoming the last lever left to protect asset value. Battery storage’s first phase was a land-grab for megawatts. The second is proving to be a contest of selective discipline. Together, California and Texas host roughly 60% of all US grid-connected capacity, offering a preview of what the rest of the country will soon confront. From their experience, five strategic signals stand out. Duration premiums harden quickly once price spikes fade.ERCOT’s ELCC tables already value 5-hour systems at nearly five times the dependable capacity of 1-hour units; CPUC modelling now assumes 8-hour resources enter by 2030. Markets that still reward 1-hour batteries are living on borrowed time. Deliverability trumps queue position.CAISO’s viability screen and Texas’ looming congestion bottlenecks mean a smaller, well-sited project can secure cheaper capital than a larger asset stuck behind a restudy or constraint. Rule-defined revenues outlast merchant spreads.4-hour Resource Adequacy in California and the forthcoming 4-hour DRRS product in Texas have replaced opportunistic arbitrage as the anchor cash flow. Future markets—PJM’s capacity reforms, MISO’s seasonal accreditation— are heading the same way. Operational discipline is no longer optional.A single missed stress-hour dispatch can wipe out a month of RA payments; a thermal event can raise insurance costs across an entire portfolio. Lenders now treat SoC telemetry, fire suppression audits, and augmentation reserves as gating items, not nice-to-haves. Policy risk is a two-sided coin.The ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act’ kept the ITC for storage but tightened the FEOC rules; state legislatures can pivot from laissezfaire to duration mandates in one session. References Hedging that volatility through flexible design, staged capex, and locational optionality will separate resilient balance sheets from speculative bets. Put bluntly, the next phase belongs to those that match hours to need, electrons to the right node, and operations to ever-stricter rulebooks, before the rules tighten further.

This has significant implications as to who pays for the collection, treatment and recycling of batteries. The shift change is being brought about by Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 which will fully replace Directive 2006/66/EC, and simultaneously it brings into effect on 18 August 2025 new regulations on the management of waste batteries and extended producer responsibilities. The 2023 Regulation introduces enhanced obligations for producers of all categories of batteries such as industrial, SLI (starting, lighting, ignition) and electric vehicle batteries to take back waste batteries regardless of their shape, volume, weight, design, material composition, chemistry, use or purpose. These new obligations aim to improve sustainability, transparency, and circularity in battery use and disposal. The financial responsibility of the producer for the recycling of used batteries is expressed in recitals 101 and 106 of the 2023 Regulation. This provides that “producers should have extended producer responsibility for the management of their batteries at the end-of-life stage. Accordingly, they should finance the costs of collecting, treating and recycling all collected batteries, carrying out compositional surveys of mixed collected municipal waste, reporting on batteries and waste batteries, and of providing information to end-users and waste operators about batteries and appropriate re-use and management of waste batteries…” Producers (in the EU market) therefore will have the responsibility to finance the costs of collection, treatment and recycling, of batteries. Importantly the 2023 Regulation does not expressly deal with contractual transfer of the cost of recycling to the end-user / or buyer (as was possible previously); such attempts to transfer costs may prove to be inadmissible (not allowed). Of course, the 2023 Regulation permits producers to itemise these costs at the point of sale (that is to build in the price at the supply contract or EPC contract price stage), however it remains questionable how feasible this is to do. How can costs be projected years ahead, within what could be a very different regulatory landscape? By contrast UK’s Waste Batteries and Accumulators Regulations 2009 (“WBAR 2009”) is based on the earlier Directive 2006/66/EC, where producers are obliged to take back batteries from end users within a reasonable time if they are producers in the compliance period when the request for take back is made. WBAR 2009, however, continues to facilitate contractual cost sharing in respect of the take-back costs of the producer. This means the UK position will now diverge from the EU position. We think that this can provide legal and commercial complexities for producers operating in the EMEA market. While some producers may seek to recover recycling costs through upfront pricing mechanisms, this approach will be difficult to implement in a price sensitive market, and vulnerable to legal scrutiny if it undermines the 2023 Regulation’s free-of-charge take-back obligation. We’re therefore likely to see varied practices in respect of how producers deal with end-of-life costs. We expect these could involve contract price adjustments, reimbursement mechanisms (which will need to be scrutinised by legal teams including those of investors undertaking due diligence), or provisions that are situated within severability provisions. Given that battery regulations can be updated and changed over the operational lifetime of a battery, the regulatory landscape could of course also change between now and then. Breaches of the EU Directive could of course have local law implications as the Directive is implemented. The EU-UK juxtaposition also creates practical challenges for businesses operating across both jurisdictions. While UK producers may contractually allocate recycling costs, EU producers will need to be seen to absorb them entirely.

    "full_text": "Battery energy storage system (BESS) project developer Pacific Green Technologies has secured a AU$77 million (US$49.9 million) debt facility for projects in Australia. The UK-headquartered company’s playbook involves developing large-scale standalone BESS assets in Europe and Australia. Pacific Green describes these developments as Energy Storage Parks, and in Australia in particular, most of its targeted opportunities are planned to have more than a gigawatt-hour of storage capacity per site. Its latest move is to get financing commitments from Australian private debt investment manager Longreach Credit Investors and non-profit investment fund Australian Philanthropic Services Foundation. The investors have agreed to provide the financing over a 24-month period. Pacific Green said it would go towards developing a 7GWh project pipeline and expanding the company’s platform within the booming Australian market. “This capital allows Pacific Green to expand our platform footprint and accelerate the development of our portfolio of BESS projects across the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM),” Pacific Green CEO Scott Poulter said. Battery storage systems are the clean energy technology with the highest levels of reliability, according to the new edition of the annualElectricity Statement of Opportunitiesreport from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), which came out a few days ago. Pacific Green was founded in 2016 and was active in marine exhaust scrubbing machinery before entering the energy storage space two years later. In 2021, it acquired the battery storage consulting business of Limejump, the UK-headquartered energy trader and BESS optimiser, the rest of which was bought up by Shell. The developer then acquired the rights to its first two projects, both in the UK, a few months later. The first of those two projects, the99.8MW/99.8MWh Richborough Energy Park in southern England, went online in late 2023, while the other, 250MW/375MWh Sheaf Energy Park is currently under construction on adjacent land. Its BESS supplier to Richborough was Chinese battery manufacturer Gotion High-Tech. It has since signed a letter of intent (LOI) for thesupply of 1,500MWh of systems at Energy Parks “across multiple jurisdictions” from Trina Storage, the BESS arm of Chinese solar major Trinasolar. In Australia, Pacific Green announced its ‘strategic entry’ into the market in October 2023 withmoves to secure land for 1GW/2.5GWh of Energy Parks in Victoria, which, at the time, it had hoped to move into construction during 2024 for commercial operation to start in 2026. Since then, it has secured planning consent from the government ofSouth Australia for its 500MW/1,500MWh Limestone Coast Energy Parkin July 2024—which it has since sold to investorIntera Renewables for AU$460 millionand signed upTrina Storage as supplier—applied for approval under Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act, for its 1GW/2.5GWh Portland BESS in Victoria. A few weeks ago, Pacific Green signed a10-year tolling agreement with developer ZEN Energy for three Australian BESS projects totalling 1.5GWhof capacity at three sites, one in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, although the specific projects were not named in a company announcement.

    "full_text": "“We’re expecting the results of the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) Tender 3 in the coming weeks,” Thimo Mueller, general manager, commercial at AusEnergy Services Ltd (ASL), said in the opening keynote of the Battery Asset Management Summit Australia 2025 this morning. The CIS Tender 3 opened in March 2025 and closed in May 2025. It sought to secure 4GW of 4-hour duration equivalent dispatchable capacity, or 16GWh. These projects are expected to be operational before 31 December 2029. Successful bidders in Tender 3 will enter into a Capacity Investment Scheme Agreement (CISA), which provides a revenue safety net through an underwriting approach. “There will be many more projects, many more battery energy storage systems (BESS) being supported by the Capacity Investment Scheme,” Mueller adds. Alongside the CIS initiative, which has been instrumental in scaling energy storage and renewable energy generation across Australia, withWestern Australia also featuring in the scheme, ASL, formerly AEMO Services, before its rebranding last month, is also supporting New South Wales in a new firming tender. “We are preparing for a 500MW firming tender in New South Wales. The focus is for projects to provide energy into the region of New South Wales, and projects need to be operational by the summer of 2027 to participate in that tender,” Mueller said. The500MW tender was first announcedby the New South Wales minister for climate change and energy, Penny Sharpe, at the Clean Energy Council’s Australian Clean Energy Summit 2025 in Sydney last month. The competitive tender process is targeting projects that must be operational by 2028. It will specifically focus on the Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong areas where capacity shortfalls areforecast to occur beginning in the summer of 2027-28. Regarding the 500MW firming tender, Mueller added that ASL is “very keen on receiving bids from aggregated portfolios of smaller batteries, because they usually have a shorter return.” Last month, the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) has announced plans to run four Capacity Investment Scheme tenders by the end of 2025. These will be for theNational Electricity Market (NEM), which spans Australia’s eastern and southern coasts and Tasmania, and theWholesale Electricity Market (WEM), which covers Western Australia. The tenders will be evenly split between the two markets, with each set to have a generation and dispatchable tender. Tenders 5 and 6, specific to the WEM, will begin in August 2025. Tenders 7 and 8, for the NEM, will commence in September and November, respectively. It is worth noting that aconsultation on the design of the CIS tender in the WEM ran earlier this year, and the feedback will guide future rounds.",

    "full_text": "Independent power producer (IPP) NextEra Energy Resources (NEER) has received approval from the Utah Inland Port Authority (UIPA) for its 200MW battery energy storage system (BESS) in Salt Lake City, Utah, US. The project will be developed in the Northwest Quadrant Project Area in Salt Lake City, adjacent to the Rocky Mountain Power Terminal Substation. NEER is operating the project through its subsidiary Dominguez Energy Storage, LLC. UIPA states that the project aims to improve the region’s power infrastructure by offering extra capacity during peak demand periods, while also promoting a more sustainable energy mix for the state. UIPA’s support includes a proposed annual property tax rebate, available upon project completion. Depending on the facility’s operational status and adherence to certain conditions, such as minimal water usage and a corporate stewardship plan, the rebate can continue for up to 25 years. At a previous UIPA board meeting, Glenn Shober, project director at NEER, clarified that Dominguez Energy Storage would serve not only the Salt Lake area but also provide a reliable energy resource for industries with around-the-clock operations. On 1 May 2024, the UIPA Incentives Committee reviewed and recommended this incentive. The board’s approval is considered a crucial step in advancing the project, allowing NEER to move forward with the development of Dominguez Energy Storage. Utah will also be the home of data centredeveloper Joule Capital Partners’ data centre campus with 1.1GWh of integrated BESS. Earlier this month, engineering equipment manufacturer Caterpillar agreed to deploy a combined heat and power (CHP) plant featuring the BESS for the campus. In June,rPlus Energies secured over US$500 million for a 400MW/1.6GWh solar-plus-storage project in Emery County, Utah. Shober said of Dominguez Energy Storage, “Battery energy storage is being requested more frequently by grid operators like Rocky Mountain Power.” He continued, “This project will support the entire region by providing crucial capacity, especially during peak load times.”",

    "full_text": "Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) has laid the groundwork for a new 120MWh distribution-connected portfolio of battery energy storage system (BESS) projects. Despite some utilities in the US shelving plans for additional BESS,such as Louisville Gas and Electric Company (LG&E) and Kentucky Utilities Company (KU), PNM is seeking regulatory approval of the new portfolio with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC). The utility is targeting 100% emissions-free electricity generation by 2040. As explained in recent documents filed with the NMPRC, PNM is seeking a certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) to install 6MW/24MWh individual BESS facilities at five of its operational solar plants located in five different counties across the state. The portfolio is the result of an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) RFP which the utility issued earlier this year in January for suppliers to deliver the portfolio. Details of the five PNM-owned solar sites to be retrofitted with BESS can be found below: After receiving bids from three suppliers, PNM negotiated a deal with Albuquerque, New Mexico-based EPC specialist Gridworks, which will deliver the project as part of a turnkey solution. As previously reported byEnergy-Storage.news,this isn’t the first time Gridworks has been successful in a PNM-administered RFP,after it secured an EPC contract last year to deliver a 30MW/120MWh co-located BESS for the utility. Recent filings with the NMPRC reveal that the utility included Tesla’s 2XL Megapack in planning documents for the five sites that use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technology. However, this does not necessarily mean Tesla Megapacks will eventually be procured for the project, as planning submissions can indicate an intended design to show regulators and authorities. As explained by PNM as part of its application, LFP technology is “widely recognised as the safest option for utility scale storage due to its minimal risk of thermal runaway compared to chemistries such as nickel manganese cobalt (NMC).” As part of its justification for the project, PNM believes the project will reduce its use of fossil fuels to meet peak system demand while also reducing costs for customers. “By storing excess solar energy for use during peak demand, the BESS reduces curtailment of renewable generation and offsets the historical reliance on fossil-fuelled resources during high-demand periods,” explained Engineering Manager for PNM, Nicholas Pollman, as part of a recent testimony filed with the NMPRC. If operated to its maximum potential, PNM claims the BESS portfolio will eliminate more than 18,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year through the avoidance of equivalent fossil fuel usage. The estimated cost of the installations is approximately US$78.7 million, which PNM plans to recover as part of a future rate case. Of the total estimated cost, Gridworks is set to receive US$71.5 million to “fully design, engineer, and install” the systems’ BESS technology, which will be transferred to PNM upon completion. PNM has requested the NMPRC approve the CPCN no later than May 6 2026 in order to deliver the project by June 2027 in time for the utility’s peak electricity demand which is expected to occur during the summer. With investment tax credits (ITCs) for utility-scale storage havingavoided an early phaseoutdue to last-minute changes to the so-called ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act,’ (‘OBBB’), PNM expects to receive approximately US$28 million in benefits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). PNM has estimated an ITC benefit of 30% – 40% for each project, with the utility expecting all five projects to receive the base 6% credit along with the 24% credit adder for Prevailing Wages & Apprenticeship. It also expects three out of the five to qualify for the additional 10% ‘Energy Communities’ adder. As part of its calculations, PNM excluded the additional 10% ‘Domestic Content’ adder, which it said will only be determined “at the time the batteries and equipment are ordered” for the BESS portfolio. PNM says that any 48E ITC benefit it receives to offset tax liability will be returned to customers. In May, PNM’s parent company, TXNM Energy, agreed to a takeover deal by global asset manager Blackstone Infrastructure. In early 2024, two-yearnegotiations over a merger between PNM and Iberdrola subsidiary Avangrid came to an endwithout a deal following legal delays.",

    "full_text": "Several new community batteries have launched in Victoria and Queensland, Australia, to help soak up distributed rooftop solar PV. The new community batteries have been launched on Phillip Island, located to the south of the state capital, Melbourne, and in the small town of Merland, in the Central Highlands region of Queensland. Six out of seven community batteries have been installed on Phillip Island in Victoria thus far. These battery energy storage systems (BESS) total 900kW/1,845kWh across seven locations on the island, including Cowes and Wimbledon Heights. The batteries are a joint project between Mondo Energy, the commercial arm of network operator AusNet, the Bass Coast Shire Council and Totally Renewable Phillip Island. The Victoria government has confirmed that the community batteries have been delivered as part of its 100 Neighbourhood Batteries Program. This initiative aims to empower communities in Victoria to benefit from rooftop solar PV without requiring individual home battery systems. Through the Neighbourhood Battery Initiative grant programme, the Victorian state government is offering up to AU$400,000 (US$257,095) per project to applicants who can demonstrate multi-use case applications for BESS. Thethird round of this programme launched in July 2025, with AU$6.6 million earmarked for the technology across the state. The initiative covers systems that include a neighbourhood battery, solar PV, a generator, and a management system. Each battery must be a minimum of 20kW/40kWh and a maximum of 5MW/20MWh. Meanwhile, in Queensland, state-owned energy company Energy Queensland has switched on a new 4MW/8MWh community battery in the town of Emerald. According to the Queensland government statement, the community battery is designed to capture the distributed rooftop solar PV systems located across the town. This amounts to around 18.4MW of generation capacity and roughly 28% of the community. Energy Queensland is currently constructing or energizing a new unit in its fleet of 30 local network-connected batteries across the state. These batteries will be utilized for network support, and any excess capacity will be shared with a retailer to trade on the National Electricity Market (NEM). This arrangement aims to maximise the benefits of the battery by reducing both network and wholesale costs. According to the state government, 18 community batteries have already been energised around the State, and 12 more are under construction and on track to be completed this financial year. Queensland’s treasurer and minister for energy, David Janetzki, said increasing the amount of energy in the market would put downward pressure on power prices. “This battery in Emerald is playing a key role in supporting Ergon Energy’s networks to gain the maximum advantage from Queensland’s abundant rooftop solar systems,” Janetzki said. “Each battery enables renewable energy to be stored locally and can support up to 500 homes in the evening peak load period, making better use of locally generated solar power when the sun goes down.” Last week, state-owned utilityWestern Power commissioned five new community batteries in Perth suburbsas part of a federally funded initiative in Western Australia. The organisation confirmed that five community BESS, each 500kW/2,800kWh, have been installed in the suburbs of Coogee, Kinross, Bayswater, Stratton and Port Kennedy.

    "full_text": "The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has found that battery energy storage systems (BESS) are the most reliable clean energy technology in the National Electricity Market (NEM). According to AEMO’s new2025 Electricity Statement of Opportunitiesreport, battery energy storage systems demonstrate the highest reliability, with approximately 70% of the NEM’s fleet having experienced unplanned outage rates of only 0-5%. It adds that longer-duration storage, defined as 4-hours or more, is more effective at reducing reliability risks than shorter-duration storage. This is because in 2030-31, expected USE in South Australia is forecast to exceed the reliability standard, with some shortfall events lasting more than four hours. In such conditions, AEMO said 2-hour battery storage systems are typically exhausted early, providing no reliability benefits for later hours of the forecast USE event. By contrast, longer duration storage can sustain output over a larger portion or even across the full duration of these USE events. Energy storage continues to emerge as a critical component of Australia’s energy transition strategy. AEMO’s report reveals various storage durations and their effectiveness in meeting reliability standards, providing crucial insights for developers and policymakers. Indeed, several different technology combinations in South Australia could be sought to help reduce expected unserved energy (USE) and meet reliability standards by 2030-31. For instance, AEMO states that 820MW of 2-hour storage would be required to reduce expected USE to meet the reliability standard. In contrast, less than half that capacity is needed if the storage has a duration of 4-hours or more – specifically, 365MW of 4-hour storage would suffice. The report also demonstrates that longer-duration storage options could provide increasingly efficient solutions: 6-hour duration storage, for example, would require 320MW. In contrast, 8-hour storage would need approximately 315MW to achieve the same reliability outcomes. According to AEMO, hybrid configurations show even greater efficiency gains. When wind is combined with 4-hour duration energy storage, the requirement drops to 295MW of storage co-located with 590MW of wind generation. Similarly, solar PV combined with 4-hour storage would require 285MW of energy storage alongside 570MW of solar. The most efficient configuration examined involves a combination of wind, solar and 4-hour storage, requiring 280MW of storage, 555MW of wind and 140MW of solar.

    "full_text": "Three companies, Energy Vault, Richardson Electronics, and Fluence, have made strategic moves to create a secure BESS equipment supply chain. Energy Vault is partnering with Turkey’s Astor Enerji, Richardson is expanding in Illinois, and Fluence is manufacturing HVAC and chiller equipment in Texas. These moves followEnergy-Storage.news’last roundup, which sawthree companies announce plans to begin domestically manufacturing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells in the US. US grid-scale energy storage solutions provider Energy Vault and Turkey-based transformer manufacturer Astor Enerji have signed a global strategic agreement to strengthen global supply chains for battery energy storage systems (BESS). The agreement will see Energy Vault supplying its B-Vault BESS for Astor Enerji’s four grid-connected PV projects in Romania, for a combined capacity of 2GWh. The projects will also utilise the company’s energy management system (EMS), VaultOS. Astor Enerji, meanwhile, will provide transformers and high-voltage equipment for more than 1GW of Energy Vault BESS projects in the US, Australia and Europe. Energy Vault notes that US transformer wait times have stretched from 50 weeks to as long as 127 weeks, emphasising that the agreement with Astor Enrji will provide the company with access to high-quality equipment from a non-foreign entity of concern (FEOC) designated nation. Energy Vault’s BESS projects are being developed and operated through its wholly owned subsidiary, Asset Vault, which is backed by a US$300 million preferred equity investment announced on 7 August. The supply chain of transformers has been tightening for some time. At the 2023 RE+ trade show in Las Vegas,system integrators and engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractors shared how lead times for the equipment had extended from 12 months to 32-36 months, plus time for the procurement cycle. Energy Vault has also been active in development,closing a US$18 million financing in July for its 57MW/114MWh Cross Trails BESS in Scurry County, Texas. Later this quarter, the company expects to receive over US$12 million in investment tax credit (ITC) funds as part of a previously agreed ITC sale agreement. Marco Terruzzin, Chief Revenue Officer at Energy Vault, said of the partnership with Astor Enerji, “Together, we are building the technology and supply chain capacity to meet surging power demand from AI data centres and the rapid adoption of renewable energy. This is how we deliver power abundance and economic growth on a global scale.” Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) and Richardson Electronics announced on 20 August that Richardson will expand its manufacturing headquarters in La Fox, Illinois. Richardson manufactures green energy products, power and grid and microwave tubes and more. With the support of the Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois (REV Illinois) programme, the company will make a capital investment of more than US$8.5 million over the next four years. Richardson Electronics will invest in equipment and structural upgrades in order to research, develop, and produce BESS at the company’s manufacturing facility. Notably, Richardson says its technology will demonstrate the viability of long-duration energy storage (LDES), and is being developed for manufacturing, healthcare and critical infrastructure operations. The company also says it will retain approximately 200 employees and create 54 full-time jobs. Richardson Electronics received a REV Illinois tax credit as part of the State’s incentive package, recognising the company’s capital investment and commitment to job creation. The agreement also outlines the retention of 190 jobs throughout the entire agreement period. In 2023, Pritzker welcomed Gotion High-Tech, a China-headquartered manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries, to the state. The company is establishing a split production facility in Illinois. In March of this year, Illinois State Senator Bill Cunningham and Representative Marcus Evans introduced a bill, HB3758, to reduce energy bills and set a 15GW energy storage deployment target. HB3758 shares many similarities with Senate Bill 3997 (SB3997),introduced by Cunningham in January, which aimed to accelerate energy storage in Illinois. Both bills seem to be at a standstill. SB3997 was adjourned without a set meeting date in January, and HB3758 was re-referred to the rules committee in March. BESS integrator Fluence, in partnership with climate control specialist Bergstrom, has started production of thermal management systems, including HVAC and chiller equipment, at a new manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas. The HVAC and chiller equipment will be used for Fluence’s Gridstack Pro BESS solution. Fluence says the Houston facility “plays a crucial role in the company’s strategy to onshore production of every major product and component of a grid-BESS to the United States.” While increasing US manufacturing of BESS materials has been an ongoing goal for some time, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) andForeign Entity of Concern (FEOC)requirements have made it an ever-present issue for companies like Fluence. As per the company’s statement, it utilises five manufacturing facilities in partnership with US-based manufacturers to produce a range of products, including battery cells, modules, inverters, enclosures, and control equipment. These collaborations account for over 1,200 manufacturing jobs in 2025. As reported yesterday (21 August), byEnergy-Storage.news,Fluence, along with ACE Engineering, just opened a new automated battery storage manufacturing facility in Vietnam’s Bac Giang Province. Fluence’s new facility has an annual manufacturing capacity of 35GWh, producing Gridstack Pro and Smartstack energy storage systems using fully automated production processes. This follows other companies, such as Chinese battery and BESS manufacturer, CATL, moving manufacturing capacity to Southeast Asia.CATL broke ground on its battery manufacturing facility in West Java, Indonesia, in July. Fluencealso recently shared its financial results for Q3 2025, reporting a quarterly revenue of US$602.5 million, up 24.7% year-on-year from US$483 million. According to the company’s latest results, delays in ramping up domestic manufacturing capabilities will push back the generation of approximately US$100 million in revenue until early next year. The company stated it experienced “some typical ramp-up issues” putting in place its Arizona production lines. Speaking on the Houston facility, Peter Williams, Fluence’s Chief Product and Supply Chain Officer, said, “This expansion helps accelerate our progress toward increasing US-based production and strengthening a resilient supply chain, and we believe it positions us to maximise domestic content in the solutions we deliver.”",

    "full_text": "Spanish utility Iberdrola and power conversion specialist firm Ingeteam have partnered to hybridise Spanish operational PV plants with battery energy storage systems (BESS). In total, four solar PV plants – in the provinces of Burgos, Huelva and the autonomous region of Extremadura – will be co-located with BESS with a total of 100MW/200MWh. Each project will consist of five medium-voltage stations that manage 25MW/50MWh BESS. The aim of hybridising BESS at the operational solar PV plants is to improve the management of the renewable energy. The storage systems supplied by Ingeteam include a proprietary hybrid power plant controller (H-PPC) coordinated with the PV plant and combines and limits the power delivered at the point of connection. Moreover, Ingeteam will supply its medium-voltage power electronics solution, control electronics, and SCADA monitoring system, which will manage the PV plants along with the new BESS plants. According to Ingeteam, the projects were awarded more than €26 million (US$30 million) in funding from the Spanish Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (IDAE), as they were recognised as Strategic Projects for Economic Recovery and Transformation (PERTE). These projectscould be part of the up to 150MW/300MWh BESS expected to be co-located with solar PVthat the utility secured funding for last year from the PERTE tender. Co-locating BESS with solar PV and renewable energy in general has become a priority in Spain after the countrywas affected by a blackout in Aprilof this year, as covered by our sister-sitePV Tech. Two months after the event, the government had approved – through a royal-decree subject to a vote in the Congress of Deputies – several measures to improve the country’s grid, including a faster administrative process to hybridise energy storage with renewables. Although the reformsended up being rejected by the Spanish Congressof Deputies last month, the Spanish government proposed a new royal decree that still aims to facilitate the co-location of BESS with renewables. A broader coverage of the Iberian blackout and its impact on solar PV was featured in the latest edition of our journalPV Tech Power, which isavailable herefor our Premium subscribers. Spain’s National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) targets around 22.5GW of energy storage by 2030, and interest in the technology has been growing in recent months. The Spanish Ministry of Environmentlaunched a financial support scheme for energy storagein June of this year, aimed at supporting the development of up to 3.5GW of projects. A total of €700 million (US$812 million) is available in the form of capex grants. “Spain is one of the most promising markets for the development of energy storage in Europe. The combination of PV with BESS not only allows for the optimal use of clean energy, but also improves the security and stability of supply,” said Katarzyna Suchcicka, VP of the management board at independent power producer R.Power, which has a BESS project portfolio of 344MW in Spain, of which 222MW are in standalone installations. More recently, thefirst solar-plus-storage power purchase agreement (PPA) in Spainwas signed between Spanish energy firm Zelestra and Portuguese utility EDP. Zelestra will build a 170MWp/400MWh solar-plus-project in the western region of Extremadura. This is not the first collaboration between Ingeteam and Iberdrola, as both companies previously partnered in the hybridisation of renewable energies with BESS, including the installation of the first BESS with an operational wind farm in Spain, said Ingeteam. The companies also collaborated in a green hydrogen project in 2022, with Ingeteamsupplying BESS for the Puertollano facility.",

    "full_text": "State-owned utility Western Power has commissioned five new community batteries in Perth suburbs as part of a federally funded initiative in Western Australia. The organisation confirmed that five community battery energy storage systems (BESS), each 500kW/2,800kWh, have been installed in the suburbs of Coogee, Kinross, Bayswater, Stratton and Port Kennedy. The Coogee community BESS is already operational, whilst Kinross, Bayswater and Stratton will be operational “shortly”. Construction at Port Kennedy is expected to begin shortly. These will service approximately 350 households, including renters and apartment dwellers who typically cannot install rooftop solar PV and storage systems. Connected households can save up to AU$132 (US$84) annually, together with a 4kWh off-peak offset under a retail subscription product being developed by Synergy, another state-owned energy company, for release later in the year. The lithium-ion battery systems are connected directly to the local distribution network, allowing them to store excess solar energy generated by households in each neighbourhood. This stored energy can then be discharged during peak demand periods, providing multiple benefits to both the grid and local residents. Western Power selected the five locations based on several factors, including the concentration of rooftop solar installations in each area and specific network requirements. The organisation added that the placement of these batteries aims to maximise their effectiveness in addressing local grid constraints while providing energy storage access to the greatest number of households. Sam Barbaro, CEO of Western Power, took to LinkedIn to celebrate the launch of the new community batteries, stating they are a “win-win for Western Power and customers.” “Currently, 40% of homes in the Western Power network have rooftop solar, and projects like this will enable a higher uptake of rooftop solar in a sustainable way that supports system security and manages infrastructure costs,” Barbaro added. Western Power confirmed the initiative received AU$2.5 million in funding through thefederal government’s AU$200 million Community Batteries for Household Solar programme, which aims to install 400 community batteries nationwide to provide shared storage for households across Australia. In addition to the federal government’s community battery programme, the federal government has invested AU$20.8 million in Project Jupiter, which aims to help Western Australian households benefit from Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). The Western Australian state government, led by Premier Roger Cook, has also launched complementary initiatives, including theWA Residential Battery Schemethat opened in July 2025. This scheme combines the AU$337 million WA Household Battery Rebate with the federal government’sAU$2.3 billion Cheaper Home Batteries programmeto support 100,000 households installing residential battery systems. The five new installations add to Western Power’s growing portfolio of community batteries across the South West Interconnected System (SWIS). The utility has been at the forefront of community battery deployment in Australia, beginning with its first PowerBank trial in Meadow Springs, which launched in 2018 and featured a 105kW/420kWh BESS.

    "full_text": "What does Trump’s tax reconciliation bill mean for US solar and BESS project development and construction right now? We hear from developer-operator Agilitas Energy CEO Barrett Bilotta. The firm is primarily known for distributed solar and battery energy storage system (BESS) projects in the Northeastern US butrecently commissioned its first BESS in Texas, part of asix-project portfolio acquired in 2023. It’s a highly uncertain time for those deploying solar, BESS and other clean energy technologies in the US.Trump’s tax reconciliation bill (OBBB)brought in an early end to tax credits for solar and wind. While it left energy storage tax credit timelines largely the same,still-to-be-clarified foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions on technology procurementsignificantly increase the risk of buying from China. Bilotta explained that the uncertainty created byTrump’s China tariffs, for which another 90-day truce was announced this week, and FEOC restrictions on technology creates challenges for procurement and progressing projects, but not an insurmountable one. “We have a lot of projects and assets that are near-term/starting construction so we feel pretty comfortable about those assets making it through the window put in by OBBB,” Bilotta said. “As an industry there are now a lot of problems for greenfield development, primarily because a bunch of the economics worked when you had tax credits for further-out projects: taking away that tax credit puts things into flux.” “As an industry, it will still go ahead and continue, but it will reset a bunch of programmes, increase electricity prices, or something else that will make things pencil out. A lot of that will boil down to higher PPA pricing for offtakers.” “There will be cost compression, because there will be less demand for construction and less demand for modules and inverters, so pricing will come down on supply side to move components.” “Everything that was a threshold project will be scrapped.” The future of BESS is closely tied to the future of solar and wind, whose variable generation is the primary demand driver for the flexibility and load-shifting services BESS generates much of its revenue from. Bilotta points to the past history of solar as a cause for optimism despite the OBBB’s early sunset of tax credits. “The market will mature more. The first maturation with solar happened with interest rates increasing after the zero-rate phenomenon. Solar suddenly needed to make the numbers work with real interest rates,” he said. “Solar projects will work but there’ll be a rejigging of the market, with states changing the types of direct subsidies, PPA buyers paying more etc.” The big question mark for energy storage is the FEOC component. For any project that didn’t start construction before 2025, tax credits will be denied if they rely too heavily on equipment from China. The same will happen if they depend on Chinese investments, pay Chinese counterparts via contracts of technology licenses. That’s a problem because most of the supply chain for batteries and BESS is in China. The US Treasury was scheduled to provide guidance on FEOC rules by 18 August. Many had doubted it would happen within that time frame, and the industry still awaits the guidance with baited breath. “From the energy storage side, we’re now just awaiting FEOC guidelines,” Bilotta said. “Our EPC team is dealing with a variety of manufacturers, switching around manufacturers. Now, if you are going to develop-build, you really need in-house expertise; you have to know what equipment works.” “We are trying to make the most rigid standard as it relates to compliance with FEOC, to meet that standard with those assets.” “If just one component is from a friendly nation like South Korea, will that hit threshold? If you buy an integrated system like Sungrow, it sounds like that wont qualify unless they totally shift their supply chain. All we can do is triage the risk.” It’s well-understood how you build solar with domestic procurement, but not so for clear for BESS which has much less capacity, Bilotta said. “Some might have more confidence about that capacity. We as a company don’t have the time pressure to make a decision. That is a luxury; others have live bullets flying.” One silver lining of all this for energy storage Barett sees is that the economic case for it may actually get stronger. We said earlier that the future of energy storage is closely tied to wind and solar, but Bilotta posits on the other hand that a slowdown in their deployment could converge with continued electricity demand growth to increase the need for energy storage. “Big energy users, states, businesses, all these things will require more energy services. The revenue side of the equation will change,” Bilotta said. “But this will depend on the buildout of EV charging and data centres.” We also discussed the company’s recent move into hydropower, with the acquisition of projects in West Virginia and Maryland totalling 44MW from Advanced Hydro Solutions, expected to be operational on the PJM grid by 2028. “We’ve been looking at hydro as an asset class for a while and the sector got a big shot in the arm with the IRA extending the tax credits to it,” Bilotta said. “Both projects get a 50% tax credit.” “There’s a huge demand for power, especially baseload, and it’s a stable asset so attractive for utilities and data centres. These projects are on federally-owned dams so that reduces the risk substantially.” “Construction is very different to solar and wind. You’re working on existing operational dams which are much more complicated. The actual units and turbines are a relatively small cost, most of the cost is building the pumphouse, temporary dams. We self-perform EPC for solar and storage, but for this we’d hire a large-scale experienced general contractor.”",

Благодаря высокой теплоёмкости расплавленная соль способна аккумулировать большое количество тепла в течение дня и сохранять его даже ночью. Затем накопленное тепло передаётся турбинам, которые вырабатывают электроэнергию, пишетEofruPikabu. Эта система обеспечивает энергией и освещением около 80 000 домов, демонстрируя эффективное использование возобновляемых источников энергии. Такой подход позволяет значительно снизить зависимость от ископаемого топлива и уменьшить выбросы парниковых газов, способствуя борьбе с изменением климата. Кроме того, технология аккумулирования тепла в расплавленной соли обеспечивает стабильное и непрерывное энергоснабжение, что является одним из главных преимуществ по сравнению с традиционными солнечными панелями, зависящими от наличия солнечного света.

    "full_text": "E²nergy — энергетика Евразии и мира Энергосбережение и развитие возобновляемых источников энергии являются одними из приоритетных задач в Узбекистане. Особое внимание уделяется обеспечению экологической устойчивости, а также повышению экономической эффективности путем реформирования сферы и внедрения инновационных технологий, пишетУзА. Акционерное общество «Узбекнефтегаз» также реализует ряд важных проектов в этом направлении. Вот что рассказал нам руководитель пресс-службы общества Мумин ИБОДОВ: – Государство поставило перед нами задачи по широкому внедрению возобновляемых источников энергии и повышению энергоэффективности. В результате строительства объектов возобновляемой энергии, внедрения современных технологий и энергосберегающего оборудования достигнуты важные результаты в обеспечении надлежащего использования энергетических ресурсов на наших предприятиях. Так, за 7 месяцев текущего года обществом сэкономлено 72,9 миллиона киловатт-часов электроэнергии и 34,48 миллиона кубометров природного газа. Эти показатели составляют 132 и 101,5 процента от намеченного плана. В целях обеспечения выполнения поручений Президента по энергосбережению и внедрению возобновляемых источников энергии в АО «Узбекнефтегаз» реализован ряд проектов. На предприятиях и в офисах установлены устройства компенсации частоты и реактивной мощности, энергосберегающие насосы, компрессоры и современные технологии. Также работают солнечная фотоэлектрическая установка мощностью 29,3 МВт, солнечные водонагреватели и освещение на основе солнечных панелей. Это позволило значительно сократить потребление электроэнергии. В настоящее время на Шуртанском газохимическом комплексе реализуется проект по производству электроэнергии из 48 тысяч кубометров отбросного газа. После выхода проекта на полную мощность комплекс будет вырабатывать 36,8 миллиона киловатт-часов электроэнергии и предотвратит выбросы 14 297 тонн Со2. В Газлийском нефтегазодобывающем управлении строится газопоршневая электростанция мощностью 7 МВт. За счет этого проекта будет вырабатываться 47 миллионов киловатт-часов электроэнергии. Также на предприятиях и в подразделениях системы внедряются модули накопления энергии BESS (Battery Energy Storage System) мощностью 95 МВт или 190 МВт·ч. Безусловно, в результате таких мер будут достигнуты экономия электроэнергии и топливных ресурсов, а также экологическая устойчивость. До конца текущего года планируется сэкономить 98,2 миллиона киловатт-часов электроэнергии и 72 миллиона кубометра природного газа. В заключение следует сказать, что реформы и инвестиционные проекты АО «Узбекнефтегаз» играют важную роль в экономии энергоресурсов и обеспечении экологической устойчивости. Новые технологии и модернизация производства вносят значительный вклад в развитие экономики Узбекистана и охрану окружающей среды. Это один из приоритетных шагов на пути к устойчивому и экологически безопасному будущему Узбекистана. E-mail:info@eenergy.mediaВеб-сайт:eenergy.mediaFacebook:eenergy.media",

Проект, который изначально должен был заработать уже в 2025 году, решено закрыть после тщательного анализа, сообщает Reuters. Как заявили в компании, такое решение было принято потому, что в нынешних условиях завод оказался бы недостаточно прибыльным и не смог бы конкурировать на рынке. Руководство пришло к выводу, что проект не сможет предложить клиентам достаточно доступное низкоуглеродное топливо. Строительство заморожено летом 2024 года из-за не самой благоприятной ситуации на рынке, а теперь его решили не возобновлять. В Shell подчеркивают, что это было трудное, но необходимое решение, чтобы вкладывать деньги только в те проекты, которые будут выгодны и клиентам, и самой компании. «НиК»: Этот шаг совпадает с общей тенденцией среди крупных нефтяных гигантов, которые в последнее время стали более осторожно инвестировать в «зеленую» энергетику, предпочитая традиционный бизнес с ископаемым топливом. © Все права защищены.

    "full_text": "На этой неделе российский газовый холдинг «Газпром» и китайская нефтегазовая госкомпания CNPCподписалимеморандум с договоренностями о строительстве «Силы Сибири-2» и транзитного газопровода через Монголию. Подобный шаг является следствием поручения главы РФВладимира Путинаи председателя КНРСи Цзиньпинав мае этого года ускорить реализацию проекта, начатого в 2020-м. Впрочем, если быть до конца честным, то «начат» — слово в этом случае не совсем верное, поскольку обсуждается постройка «Силы Сибири 2» уже долгие годы и слово «ускорение» тут впору заменить на фразу «было бы неплохо хотя бы начать». Впрочем, на этот раз на саммите ШОС реальный процесс, похоже, действительно начался. Согласно документу, импорт по «Силе Сибири 2» будет осуществляться в течение 30 лет. Ирония в том, что говорят о проекте, который де-факто еще даже не начали реализовывать, гораздо дольше. На самом деле впервые о «Силе Сибири 2» заговорили не в 2020-м, а в далеком 2016 году. А в идеале можно сказать, что даже в 2014 году, когда глава «Газпрома» сообщил о проработке с китайской стороной нового газопровода по «западному маршруту». Если же копнуть еще глубже, то можно вообще вспомнить планы строительства газопровода, о которых Владимир Путин заявил в марте 2006 года. Тогда проект носил название «Алтай» и предполагал строительство через узкий участок российско-китайской границы в районе Алтайских гор. Но из-за экологических проблем, связанных с прохождением через природоохранные зоны, проект не получил финансирования. Официально. На практике же все могло банально упереться в дороговизну проекта, неготовность российского холдинга тратиться на подобное направление при растущей премиальности европейского рынка газа. Ради которого, кстати, тогда планировались «Северный поток» и «Южный поток» (через Болгарию, но в итоге построен «Турецкий поток»). Что интересно, за долгие годы, когда проект возрождался, а потом снова откладывался в долгий ящик и даже менял маршруты, его пропускная способность закладывалась почти одна и та же — 50 млрд кубометров в год. Сейчас в подписанном меморандуме «Газпрома» и CNPC о «Силе Сибири 2» объем прокачки именно такой. Что касается маршрута, то он будет проходить через Монголию по коммуникации «Союз Восток». Протяженность всего газопровода из РФ в Китай — около 6700 км, из которых 2700 км пройдет по территории РФ. «Сила Сибири 2» охватывает более протяженный маршрут, чем «Сила Сибири». Зато второй газопровод ориентирован на месторождения Западной Сибири (первый трубопровод использует ресурсы Восточной Сибири), где уже ведется добыча. В 2019 году был подписан меморандум с Монголией о реализации проекта. Увы, но после этого никакой постройки не началось, а контракт с Китаем российская сторона не заключила. Весной 2023-го российское правительство одобрило соглашение о поставках газа в Китай по «Силе Сибири-2». Но переговоры вновь затянулись. В западной прессе тогда, и надо признать не без причины, предположили, что причина — тяжелый торг Пекина по цене за российский газ, который должен покупаться на долгосрочной основе. Кстати, пример работы «Силы Сибири» показывает, что «Газпром» зарабатывает (точных цифр компания официально не называет, но делала намеки) на продаже голубого топлива Китаю явно меньше, чем на европейском рынке. По крайней мере, до 2022-го года, когда газовый холдинг экспортировал туда около 150 млрд кубометров в год. Теперь же китайская сторона на саммите ШОС все-таки решила, что договариваться надо. Если бы это была очередная пустышка, т. е. попытка поторговаться, а в случае отсутствия уступок от российской стороны, разойтись как и в прежние годы, тогда подписание такого документа сделали бы не во время саммита. Сегодня есть основания предполагать, что Китай действительно «созрел» или близок к этому состоянию, чтобы начать реализацию проекта «Сила Сибири 2». Все-таки за последние шесть лет потребности экономики КНР в природном газе выросли на 150 млрд кубометров в год. К 2035 году Пекин планирует потреблять около 650 млрд кубометров в год. Для сравнения: по итогам 2024-го — 425 млрд кубометров (+4% к прошлому году). Аналитик ФНЭБ эксперт Финансового университета при правительстве РФИгорь Юшковсчитает, что Китаю все же нужен дополнительный газ от России. Спрос в КНР растет на почти 20 млрд кубометров ежегодно. Энергии нужно все больше. Пекин, конечно, развивает все направления (АЭС, гидроэлектростанции, ВИЭ), но и газ ему нужен во все больших количествах. «Силу Сибири» строили пять лет. Для «Силы Сибири 2» времени потребуется не меньше. Да, для этого проекта, в отличие от первого, не придется разрабатывать новые месторождения, нужно только создать линейную часть, газокомпрессорные станции и т. д. Но все равно в итоге коммуникация будет готова только к 2030 году. Еще примерно пять лет — это выход на проектную мощность. Игорь Юшков подчеркнул, что все это перспектива 2030–2035 гг. К тому времени потребление в КНР может существенно возрасти. И что еще важно в нынешнем моменте, Китай прекрасно понимает, что США и дальше будут давить на КНР, в том числе и за счет ограничения поставок для Китая углеводородов. Сегодня Вашингтон давит пошлинами на Нью-Дели, а кто сказал, что завтра не будет нового витка давления на Пекин, а ему не начнут запрещать покупать газ? Из-за этого Китай вынужден теперь учитывать все риски поставок. Как подчеркнул аналитик ФНЭБ, все, что идет из России с севера, для КНР гораздо безопаснее, чем то, что Поднебесная закупает с юга. Не исключено, что Пекин поэтому и преодолел свой страх того, что опасно складывать все яйца в одну корзину (импортировать все больше и больше газа у РФ). Соображения энергобезопасности для Пекина, похоже, перевесили риски зависимости от одного продавца. Именно поэтому уже сейчас китайская сторона согласилась наувеличение поставок по «Силе Сибири» с 38 млрд до 44 млрд кубометров в год и по «дальневосточному маршруту» с 10 млрд до 12 млрд. Не исключено, что Пекин все больше переживает и из-за войны на Ближнем Востоке, где конфликт Ирана и Израиля может создать проблемы для прохода почти 20% всего СПГ, производимого в мире. Эксперт допускает возможность того, что подписание контракта «Силе Сибири 2» решено просто перенести на проведение Восточного экономического форума в России, который состоится уже совсем скоро. Саммит ШОС сейчас и так забирает на себя много внимания. Игорь Юшков считает, чтодля Китая это самый удобный момент. Россия все еще под санкциями, у нее минимальные поставки газа в Европу. А вот в перспективе есть риски и для Китая. Не исключено, что вскоре может произойти потепление отношений РФ и Запада. © Все права защищены.

    "full_text": "В мире продолжается гонка эффективности тандемных солнечных элементов, изготовленных с использованием перовскитов. Правда, пока эти изделия не применяются в солнечной энергетике, однако лабораторные результаты, демонстрируемые десятком известных производителей, дают надежду на коммерциализацию технологии. Тандемные ячейки, состоящие из монокристаллического кремния и перовскитных материалов, имеют теоретический предел эффективности около 43 процентов, что намного превышает возможности обычных однопереходных кремниевых солнечных элементов, составляющих основу современной солнечной энергетики. Компания Huasun Energy, крупный китайский производитель гетероструктурных (HJT) модулей, сообщила о «двух прорывах» в области тандемных солнечных элементов на основе кристаллического кремния с гетеропереходом (HJT) и перовскита. Эффективность крошечного (1 см²) «лабораторного» солнечного элемента достигла 34,02%, а крупногабаритного (210 мм) элемента в стандартных производственных условиях – 29,01%. Второй результат почти на 4% выше, чем у современных стандартных однопереходных кристаллических кремниевых солнечных элементов. Huasun утверждает, что «этот прорыв стал возможным благодаря собственной технологии нанесения крупнотекстурных тонких пленок, которая обеспечивает равномерное покрытие на сложных поверхностях и решает ключевые проблемы масштабирования перовскитных материалов. Внедрив органические стабилизаторы, Huasun улучшила равномерность осаждения и устойчивость к воздействию окружающей среды, а новые материалы для межфазного транспорта повысили надежность и совместимость технологических процессов. В совокупности эти достижения значительно приближают тандемные элементы к массовому производству». Производитель говорит, что «как только эффективность тандема превысит 30%, стоимость солнечной энергии может упастьниже одного цента США за ватт, открывая путь к конкурентоспособным по стоимости зеленому водороду и накоплению энергии» [вероятно, Huasun имеет ввиду эффективность серийных тандемных продуктов, а что касается стоимости солнечной энергии, непонятно, о чем речь; стоимость обычных ячеек составляет сегодня в Китае более четырех центов США за ватт]. В июне текущего года Trina Solarпредставилатандемный солнечный модуль мощностью 841 ватт с эффективностью 27,1%. Также в июне LONGiобъявилаоб эффективности преобразования тандемного солнечного элемента из кристаллического кремния и перовскита «большой площади» (260,9 см2) в 33%, что явилось «мировым рекордом» (для тандемных ячеек большой площади). В апреле LONGiобъявилао новом мировом рекорде эффективности преобразования энергии тандемного солнечного элемента из перовскита и кремния — 34,85% (речь идёт о малом лабораторном образце). Это только некоторые последние результаты — в этой области идёт постоянное движение. Не исключаю, что тандемная технология найдет коммерческое применение.

    "full_text": "Производство «чистой электроэнергии» в Индии выросло на 20% до новых максимумов с начала года, что дало энергетикам редкую возможность сократить производство электроэнергии на основе ископаемого топлива и снизить зависимость от импорта энергоносителей, сообщает Reuters со ссылкой на данные исследовательской компании Ember. За первую половину 2025 года индийские энергетические предприятия выработали рекордные 236 тераватт-часов (ТВт*ч) «чистой электроэнергии» (ВИЭ + АЭС). Это на 20% больше, чем за тот же период 2024 года, ипозволило генераторам сократить производство электроэнергии из ископаемого топлива на 4% по сравнению с предыдущим годом, до примерно 691 ТВт*ч. Основными факторами сталирост ветрогенерации на 29% (до 47,2 ТВт*ч) и солнечной генерации на 25% (до 85 ТВт*ч). Рекордная выработка индийской атомной энергетики (29 ТВт*ч) и рост выработки гидроэлектростанций на 14% по сравнению с прошлым годом также способствовали росту общего объема чистой электроэнергии. Что касается ископаемого топлива,выработка электроэнергии на угле снизилась на 3%по сравнению с предыдущим годом до 675 ТВт*ч, в то время как выработка электроэнергиина основе природного газасократилась на 34%до 13,75 ТВт*ч. В первой половине 2025 года общий объем чистой генерации из всех источников примерно на 24% превысил средний уровень за те же месяцы 2022-2024 гг. В июне доля чистой энергии в общем объеме генерации составила 31%, что стало самым высоким показателем за этот месяц и означало, что доля электроэнергии, вырабатываемой из ископаемого топлива, впервые опустилась ниже 70%. Данные о выработке электроэнергии в Индии в июле и августе еще не опубликованы, но, вероятно, доля чистой энергии в общем объеме генерации в этот период будет еще выше, поскольку в этот период выработка на основе ветра и гидроэлектростанций, как правило, достигает годовых пиков. Индияввела в стройрекордные 18 ГВт мощностей солнечной энергетики в первой половине 2025 года. Это указывает на дальнейший быстрый рост выработки на основе ВИЭ. Тем не менее, Индия планирует строить новые угольные ТЭС в целях «энергетической безопасности». Ожидается, что потребление электроэнергии в странебудет растина 6–6,5% в течение следующих пяти лет.

    "full_text": "Индийская группа Reliance, принадлежащая миллиардеру Мукешу Амбани, планирует начать производство на своей будущей гигафабрике по производству аккумуляторов в 2026 году. Первоначальная годовая мощность завода составит 40 ГВт*ч. Впоследствии она будет поэтапно увеличена до 100 ГВт*ч в год, объявил исполнительный директор Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) Анант Амбани на ежегодном общем собрании компании. Ранее Relianceпланироваланачать производство аккумуляторных батарей в 2023 году, и довести мощности до 50 ГВт*ч в год к 2027 году. Завод по производству аккумуляторов расположен на территории гигантского промышленного комплекса зеленой энергии Дхирубхаи Амбани в Джамнагаре, штат Гуджарат (Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga), где также размещаются крупные фабрики по производству солнечных модулей и электролизёров. Амбани сообщил, что электролизерный гигазавод RIL планируется запустить к концу 2026 года. Мощность этого объекта составит до 3 ГВт в год, что позволит производить «зелёный» водород по конкурентоспособной, по мировым меркам, цене. Кроме того, компания планирует увеличить собственное производство водорода до 3 миллионов тонн в год Завод по производству солнечных панелей ужевведен в эксплуатацию. Он успешно выпустил первые высокоэффективные гетероструктурные (HJT) солнечные модули мощностью 200 МВт. «Эти модули демонстрируют лучшие в отрасли характеристики: на 10% выше выходная мощность, на 20% выше устойчивость к температурам и на 25% ниже деградация», — сообщил Амбани. RIL планирует в ближайшие кварталы увеличить годовую производственную мощность этого предприятия до 10 ГВт с последующим расширением до 20 ГВт. Вместе эти предприятия создадут «многофункциональную экосистему чистой энергии гигаваттного масштаба», объединяющую под одной крышей оборудование для солнечной энергетики, накопления энергии и производства зеленого водорода. «Этот комплексный подход не только обеспечивает масштабируемость, но и создаёт конкурентное преимущество в плане стоимости, технологий и устойчивости цепочки поставок, позволяя Reliance получать значительную выгоду по мере ускорения глобального энергетического перехода», — сказал Амбани. «Reliance станет единственной в мире полностью интегрированной, самодостаточной компанией в области новой энергетики», — добавил он. Амбани сообщил, что работы над энергетическим комплексом Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga идут рекордными темпами. Он не будет иметь себе равных в мире по размерам, масштабу и уровню интеграции. Компания заявила, что солнечные панели, произведенные на ее заводе в Джамнагаре, поставляются в Кутч в штате Гуджарат, где она строит солнечную электростанцию, «одну из крупнейших в мире». Ранее компания говорила, что хочет построить «как минимум» 100 ГВт солнечной генерации в штате Гуджарат до 2030 года.

Компания вошла во вкус и намедни решила построить новую установку по производству зеленого водорода на другой площадке — в промышленном комплексе JSL Kalinga Nagar в Джаджпуре, Одиша. Для этого Jindal заключила соглашение с Greenzo Energy India Ltd на поставку, строительство и ввод в эксплуатацию соответствующего оборудования. Доставка запланирована в течение шести месяцев после подписания контракта. Первоначально завод будет производить 5 256 000 Нм³/год зеленого водорода (приблизительно 0,47 тысячи тонн) с последующим масштабированием до 1,5 тысячи тонн в год. Зеленый водород будет использоваться в критически важных процессах производства нержавеющей стали, что позволит Jindal Stainless выпускать зеленую сталь и значительно сократить свой углеродный след. Ранее Jindal Stainless, крупнейший производитель нержавеющей стали в Индии, официальновзял на себя обязательствадостичь углеродной нейтральности (Net Zero) до 2050 года в соответствии с методологией Инициативы по научно обоснованным целям(SBTi). В дополнение к поставке технологий, Greenzo обеспечит комплексное обучение и оперативную поддержку, включая 30 дней обучения на месте для технической команды JSL и 11 месяцев виртуального руководства, обеспечивая бесперебойную интеграцию завода и долгосрочную операционную эффективность. Сандип Агарвал, управляющий директор Greenzo Energy India Ltd, заявил: «Наши электролизерные системы, разработанные в Индии, предназначены для обеспечения эффективности, надежности и масштабируемости. Полностью отечественный щелочной биполярный электролизер оснащен разработанной в Индии технологией биполярного стека, обеспечивает выход водорода при давлении 30 бар, сверхвысокую чистоту 99,99999% и поставляется с интегрированной автоматизацией на основе SCADA и искусственного интеллекта для оптимизации в режиме реального времени и прогнозной диагностики. Мы гордимся, что поддерживаем дорожную карту чистой энергии JSL и вносим значительный вклад в миссию Индии по зеленому водороду». В августе 2021 года премьер-министр Индии Нарендра Модиобъявил о запуске «Национальной водородной миссии»(National Green Hydrogen Mission) с целью сделать Индию «глобальным центром производства, использования и экспорта зеленого водорода и его производных». Миссия нацелена на производство 5 миллионов тонн зеленого водорода к 2030 году и связанное с этим развитие мощностей возобновляемой энергетики. В феврале 2022 года Индия опубликовалаполитикув области зеленого водорода / зеленого аммиака (Green Hydrogen/ Green Ammonia Policy). В феврале нынешнего года Министерство новых и возобновляемых источников энергии Индииопубликовало«Руководящие принципы реализации пилотных проектов по использованию зеленого водорода в сталелитейном секторе» в рамках «Национальной водородной миссии». В то время пока Европа сталкивается с большими трудностями при внедрении зеленого водорода в промышленности, Индия превращается в одного из мировых лидеров водородной экономики. Свидетельством тому, например, являются выдающиесярезультатыконкурсных отборов на поставки зеленого аммиака, проходящие в стране.

    "full_text": "Компания Sinovoltaics опубликовала отчет, в котором содержатся сведения о фабриках по производству солнечных панелей и ячеек, которые строятся или запланированы к строительству в Африке и на Ближнем Востоке. В настоящее время в регионе размещены производства солнечных панелей общей мощностью 3,4 ГВт, элементов (ячеек) мощностью 2,5 ГВт и кремниевых слитков (кристаллов) на 8,05 ГВт. По данным Sinovoltaics, к 2030 году мощности по производству фотоэлектрических модулей достигнут 62,12 ГВт, солнечных элементов 52,55 ГВт, поликремния – 45 ГВт. Кроме того, ожидается создание производств металлургического кремния мощностью 290 тысяч тонн. Особенно следует подчеркнуть вертикальную интеграцию – инвесторы ориентированы не только на сборку модулей в странах Ближнего Востока и Африки, но и на создание всей цепочки, начиная с производства поликремния. Это позволит закрыть местные потребности и также обеспечить экспорт на рынки, которые закрыты или закрываются от китайских изделий по политическим и/или протекционистским причинам, основной из которых – США. Кроме того, близость региона к Европе потенциально позволит заместить продукцию из Юго-Восточной Азии в европейском импорте. В отчете перечислены 27 производственных площадок, которые обозначены на приложенной карте. Разумеется, среди инвесторов много китайских компаний, в том числе такие гранды, как JinkoSolar и JA Solar. В июле 2024 года Саудовская Аравияпривлеклакитайских инвесторов для создания гигантских производств кремниевых пластин, солнечных модулей и ветряных турбин. Намедниотмечалось, что импорт солнечных панелей из Китая вырос в Африке на 60% за последние 12 месяцев (июль 2024-июнь 2025) и составил 15,03 ГВт. Это свидетельствует о быстром росте солнечной энергетике на континенте. В марте текущего годасообщалось, что японский производитель фотоэлектрических элементов и модулей Toyo Solar планирует увеличить свои мощности по выпуску солнечных элементов (ячеек) в Эфиопии до 4 ГВт. В 2024 году компания EliTe Solarобъявилаоб инвестициях в создание производственного комплекса по выпуску фотоэлектрических ячеек и модулей годовой мощностью 8 ГВт в Суэцкой китайско-египетской зоне экономического и торгового сотрудничества (TEDA Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone) в Египте. Первый этап строительства, который, как ожидается, будет завершен к сентябрю 2025 года, предполагает создание производства солнечных батарей мощностью 2 ГВт.
