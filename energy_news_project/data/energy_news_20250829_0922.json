Результаты работыопубликованыв журнале Energy & Environmental Materials. Исследователи использовали скорлупу миндаля, фундука, пекана и грецкого ореха, богатую порами и гидрофильными группами. При контакте с водой эти микроканалы запускают гидровольтаический эффект — движение ионов под действием испарения и капиллярных сил, что приводит к генерации электрического тока. Устройство из скорлупы грецкого ореха показало стабильное напряжение более 600 мВ и плотность мощности свыше 5,9 мкВт/см², работающую на протяжении недели. После специальной обработки производительность выросла: напряжение достигло 1,21 В, а максимальная плотность тока — 347,2 μА/см², что превышает показатели большинства органических и неорганических аналогов. Две такие установки, соединенные вместе, смогли питать LCD-калькулятор без дополнительных преобразователей. По словам авторов, технология демонстрирует, как аграрные отходы — обычная ореховая скорлупа — могут стать доступным и экологичным источником энергии для питания небольших электронных устройств. В перспективе такие генераторы смогут использовать влагу, дождевую воду или даже морскую воду, открывая новые возможности для развития устойчивой энергетики. Ранее ученыеразработалинеобычный источник энергии — биоразлагаемую батарею, которая работает на воде и сахаре.",

Об этом написал на своей странице в Facebook(принадлежит Meta – организация признана экстремистской и запрещена в РФ)глава МИД Венгрии Петер Сийярто после телефонного разговора с первым замминистра энергетики РФ Павлом Сорокиным. По словам Сийярто, повреждения на распределительной станции нефтепровода, нанесенные в результате украинских атак с применением беспилотников и ракет, оказались серьезными, поэтому восстановительные работы заняли несколько дней. 22 августа министрсообщил, что из-за третьей за неделю атаки ВСУ поставки нефти в Венгрию и Словакию остановлены минимум на пять дней. До этого прокачка по южной ветке «Дружбы» приостанавливалась 13 и 18 августа, но ее быстро восстанавливали. 26 августа Сийяртозаявил, что, по его мнению, Еврокомиссия знала об ударах по «Дружбе». Он отметил, что трудно поверить в отсутствие координации между Владимиром Зеленским,Урсулой фон дер Ляйени другими европейскими лидерами. Министр обратил внимание, что ЕК пообещала защищать энергетику ЕС, но проигнорировала факт атак на нефтепровод, обеспечивающий Венгрию и Словакию. Сийярто такжесообщил, что Будапешт рассматривает возможность прекратить экспорт электроэнергии на Украину. По его словам, речь идет о поставках объемом до 40% украинского импорта.

    "full_text": "Исследовательская компания BloombergNEF (BNEF) опубликовала новый отчет о мировых инвестициях в ВИЭ в первом полугодии 2025 «Renewable Energy Investment Tracker». Инвестиции в новые проекты возобновляемой энергетики достигли рекордных 386 млрд долларов США в первой половине текущего года, что на 10% больше, чем в предыдущем году. Однако авторы отмечают, что инвестиции в крупномасштабные солнечные электростанции и наземную ветроэнергетику сократились. Общий рост был достигнут благодаря офшорной ветроэнергетике, инвестиции в которую существенно возросли. BNEF отмечает, что инвестиции в солнечные фотоэлектрические станции крупного масштаба (utility scale) пострадали особенно сильно, упав на 19% по сравнению с первой половиной 2024 года. На рынках, где наблюдалось наибольшее снижение инвестиций в годовом исчислении, включая материковый Китай, Испанию, Грецию и Бразилию, отмечался рост вынужденных потерь, а также участились случаи отрицательных цен на электроэнергию, что свидетельствует о том, что опасения инвесторов по поводу доходов имеют первостепенное значение. Активность инвесторов в секторе солнечной энергетики была выше на рынках с эффективно структурированными государственными тендерами или высоким корпоративным спросом на электроэнергию. Инвестиции в малые солнечные электростанции компенсировали сокращение финансирования более крупных проектов, поскольку малые объекты можно быстро развернуть и запустить до существенных изменений в политике, влияющих на доходы или окупаемость. Например, в материковом Китае инвестиции в малые солнечные электростанции почти удвоились в годовом исчислении. «Инвесторы и разработчики проектов в области возобновляемой энергетики пересматривают распределение капитала и вкладывают средства в проекты с наибольшей доходностью», — отметила Мередит Аннекс, руководитель отдела чистой энергии в BloombergNEF. Из всех основных регионов в США наблюдалось наибольшее падение новых инвестиций в возобновляемую энергетику в первой половине 2025 года: объём утвержденных финансовых вложений сократился до 20,5 млрд долларов (на 36%) по сравнению со второй половиной 2024 года. Это отражает реакцию отрасли на выборы в США 2024 года: энергетики поспешили начать строительство в конце прошлого года, чтобы получить доступ к налоговым льготам, а затем замедлили темпы роста в первой половине нынешнего года из-за ухудшения политической ситуации, особенно в сфере ветроэнергетики, и растущей неопределённости в отношении тарифов. «Рынки с механизмами, гарантирующими доходы сохранили динамику инвестиций в возобновляемую энергетику», — отмечает Аннекс. «В то время как проекты на рынках, где отмечается неопределенность в части доходов, переживают циклы подъемов и спадов». В странах ЕС-27 инвестиции в первой половине 2025 года выросли почти на 30 млрд долларов США, или на 63%, по сравнению со второй половиной 2024 года. Эти данные подтверждают идею, что компании перераспределяют капитал из США в Европу, особенно в офшорную ветроэнергетику, где некоторые инвесторы переориентировались на объекты в Северном море, выйдя их американских проектов. В Юго-Восточной Азии инвестиции выросли на 7% по сравнению со второй половиной 2024 года. Материковый Китай остался крупнейшим рынком с долей в 44% мировых новых инвестиций в первой половине 2025 года. Согласен сПолитикой конфиденциальности",

    "full_text": "Китайская компания HiTHIUM, один из крупнейших в мире поставщиков решений для систем накопления энергии, получила крупный контракт от саудовской электрической компании Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) на реализацию двух проектов по накоплению энергии на основе аккумуляторов в провинциях Табук и Хаиль на севере Саудовской Аравии. Ёмкость объектов составит суммарно 4 ГВт*ч. На них будут установлены контейнерные накопители HiTHIUM ∞Power 6,25MWh Desert Eagle, в которых используется «ведущая в отрасли» технология ячеек ∞Cell 1175Ah, которую компания называет «первым в мире массовым решением для длительного хранения энергии». Системы специально разработаны для того, чтобы выдерживать экстремальные климатические условия Саудовской Аравии: Системы будут предоставлять основные вспомогательные услуги энергосистеме, включая сдвиг нагрузки, возможность холодного пуска, регулирование частоты и поддержку напряжения. Проекты реализуются в сотрудничестве с местной компаний Alfanar Projects, которая будет отвечать за строительство. Ввод в эксплуатацию намечен на 2026 год. Доктор Керамат Фахари, президент HiTHIUM по Ближнему Востоку и Африке заявил: «Этот знаковый проект на 4 ГВт*ч знаменует собой поворотный момент — не только для Саудовской Аравии, но и для приверженности HiTHIUM обеспечению критически важных накопителей энергии там, где это наиболее важно. Интегрируя нашу ведущую в отрасли технологию ∞Cell с видением SEC и региональным опытом Alfanar, мы переосмысливаем интеграцию возобновляемых источников энергии в экстремальных условиях». Саудовская Аравия строит объекты солнечной и ветровой энергетикив гигантских масштабах. В июне прошлого годасообщалось, что королевство будет ежегодно проводить конкурсные отборы проектов ВИЭ объемом 20 ГВт и намерено увеличить мощности возобновляемой энергетики до 100-130 ГВт к 2030 году. Правительство страны планирует довести долю ВИЭ в выработке электроэнергии до 50% к 2030 году. Для поддержки интеграции переменной генерации на основе солнца и ветра в стране реализуются крупномасштабные проекты по накоплению энергии. В октябре прошлого года Hithium и саудовская MANATобъявилио создании совместного предприятия (СП), целью которого является создание в Саудовской Аравии мощностей по производству аккумуляторных систем накопления энергии с планируемой годовой мощностью 5 ГВт*ч. В феврале текущего года китайская BYDсообщилао подписании «крупнейшего в мире контракта» с саудовской энергетической компанией Saudi Electricity Company на реализацию проекта по хранению энергии ёмкостью 12,5 ГВт*ч. Ранее BYD поставила свои системы накопления энергии (СНЭ) длягигантского объектамощностью 500 МВт / ёмкостью 2000 МВт*ч, который в январе 2025 года введен в эксплуатацию в провинции Асир в Саудовской Аравии.

    "full_text": "По информации Energy Monitor, в первом полугодии 2025 года Китай ввел в эксплуатацию 21 ГВт мощностей угольной генерации. За тот же период объем вывода из эксплуатации угольных ТЭС составил 1 ГВт. По данным Национального управления энергетики КНР (NEA), с января по июнь 2025 года прирост мощностей ТЭС (не только угольных)составил25,78 ГВт, аза семь месяцев41,98 ГВт. Согласно Energy Monitor, 21 ГВт – самый высокий показатель прироста угольной энергетики КНР за первое полугодие с 2016 года. В 2024 году Китайввёл в строй30,5 ГВт угольных ТЭС, больше, чем весь остальной мир. По его итогам установленная мощность угольной энергетики Китаядостиглапримерно 1,19 ТВт (1190 ГВт). В том же 2024 году в КНР был зафиксирован рекордный (с 2015 года) объем угольных мощностей, строительство которых началось — 94 ГВт. Это стало следствием чрезвычайно активной выдачи разрешений в 2022-2023 годах, что и привело к буму, который мы наблюдаем в году нынешнем. Energy Monitor прогнозирует, чтов текущем году в Китае может быть введено более 80 ГВт новых мощностей угольной генерации– более чем существенное увеличение по сравнению с 2024. И это может стать абсолютным рекордом. На нынешний день максимальный годовой объем ввода угольных мощностей (63 ГВт) был достигнут в 2008 году. По недавнему прогнозу Совета по электроэнергетике Китая (CEC), мощности угольной энергетики КНР к концу 2025 годасоставятоколо1270 ГВт. Следует отметить, что это на 40 ГВт превышаетпрогноз CEC, опубликованный в конце 2021 года. Вычтя 1190 из 1270, мы получим как раз те 80 ГВт, о которых говорит Energy Monitor. Отметим, что ещё в середине 2024 года солнечные и ветровые электростанции КНРобошлиугольные по установленной мощности. В августе NEAсообщало, что в первом полугодиипотребление угля в стране «немного» снизилось, в основном из-за таких факторов, как теплая зимняя погода и значительное увеличение выработки на основе новых источников энергии.Весь прирост потребления электроэнергии с января по июнь был покрыт возобновляемыми источниками энергии. Более того, потребление угля в электроэнергетике Китая в первом полугодии 2025сократилосьна 3,4% по сравнению с аналогичным периодом годом ранее. Итак, мощности угольных ТЭС растут, а выработка нет, КИУМ падает, потребление угля падает. Почему же Китай строит всё новые и новые угольные энергоблоки? Мы можем сформулировать несколько соображений: В апреле текущего года власти КНРвыпустили«План реализации специальных мероприятий по модернизации нового поколения угольных электростанций (2025–2027 гг.)», целью которого является создание и совершенствование системы технических показателей угольной энергетики по четырем аспектам: чистое сокращение выбросов углерода, безопасность и надежность, эффективное регулирование и интеллектуальная эксплуатация. СогласнопрогнозуКитайской национальной угольной ассоциации (CNCA), КНР достигнет пика потребления угля в 2028 году. В 2021 году председатель КНР Си Цзиньпинзаявил, что Китай будет строго контролировать проекты по производству электроэнергии на основе угля, строго ограничивать рост потребления угля в течение 14-й пятилетки (2021-2025) и постепенно сокращать его в период 15-й пятилетки (2026-2030). Это необходимо для достижения обещанного Китаем пика выбросов СО2 до 2030 года иуглеродной нейтральности к 2060 году.

    "full_text": "По данным исследовательской компании Mercom India Research, в первой половине 2025 года в Индии было установлено 18 ГВт солнечных мощностей, что на 31% больше, чем годом ранее. Это примерно соответствуетданным, ранее опубликованным JMK Research. И в первом полугодии, и во втором квартале 2025 были зафиксированы рекордные показатели прироста солнечных мощностей. По состоянию на конец июня установленная мощность солнечной энергетики страны достигла 116,4 ГВт (правительство Индии ужесообщило, что по итогам июля она выросла до 119,02 ГВт). Основной сегмент — это крупномасштабные солнечные станции, на которые приходится 86% установленной мощности. Среди штатов лидируют Раджастхан, Гуджарат и Карнатака. Согласно отчёту Mercom, на конец июня 2025 года на долю солнечной энергетики приходилось 24% от общей установленной мощности электроэнергетики страны и более 49% от общей установленной мощности возобновляемых источников энергии. Однако, по словам управляющего директора Mercom India Прии Санджая, количество солнечных электростанций в Индии могло бы быть больше, если бы энергетики сталкивались с меньшими трудностями при поиске модулей, соответствующих требованиям к локализации (DCR). Особенно с учётом появления нового списка моделей и производителей солнечных элементов (ALMM) List-II, вероятно, возникнет краткосрочный дефицит модулей. Ранее правительство Индиисообщало, что мощности по производству солнечных фотоэлектрических модулей, входящих в Утверждённый список моделей и производителей (ALMM) достигли 100 ГВт. «Без роста внутреннего производства и сбалансированных мер политики, ввод мощностей будет оставаться под давлением и отставать от расширяющегося портфеля проектов». На конец июня 2025 года портфель крупных проектов в области солнечной энергетики в Индии на разных стадиях реализации составлял почти 191 ГВт, при этом еще 131 ГВт находятся на стадии тендерных процедур. В 2024 году Индиядобавиларекордные объёмы мощностей солнечной генерации – 24,5 ГВт. В январе 2025 года установленная мощность солнечной энергетики страныпревысила100 ГВт. При сохранении нынешних темпов, по итогам 2025 года Индия может обойти США по годовому приросту мощностей солнечной энергетики.

    "full_text": "Apple больше не может рекламировать свои Apple Watch как «CO2-нейтральный продукт» в Германии после вынесенного во вторник решения суда, удовлетворившего жалобу экологов, установивших, что американская технологическая компания вводила потребителей в заблуждение. Случай широко освещается в немецкой прессе. Apple продвигала устройство в интернете как «наш первый CO2-нейтральный продукт». Судьи сочли это заявление необоснованным и нарушающим немецкое законодательство о конкуренции, говорится в заявлении окружного суда во Франкфурте. Представитель Apple заявил, что решение суда «в целом подтверждает наш строгий подход к углеродной нейтральности», и отказался комментировать, будет ли компания подавать апелляцию на решение. В июне Apple заявляла, что немецкий иск грозит «подорвать те действенные меры корпораций по борьбе с изменением климата, в которых нуждается мир». Тем не менее, во вторник представитель компании сообщил, что Apple постепенно откажется от маркировки «углеродно-нейтральный», используемой для Apple Watch, в соответствии с законодательством ЕС, вступающим в силу в сентябре 2026 года и ограничивающим использование подобных терминов. Apple обосновывала своё заявление об углеродной нейтральности с помощью проекта по компенсации выбросов путём посадки эвкалиптов на арендованных землях в Парагвае. Однако эвкалиптовые плантации подвергаются критике со стороны экологов, которые утверждают, что такие монокультуры наносят ущерб биоразнообразию и требуют большого расхода воды, из-за чего их прозвали «зелёными пустынями». Франкфуртский суд заявил, что аренда 75% территории плантации в парагвайском климатическом проекте не была обеспечена на период после 2029 года, и что компания не может гарантировать продление этих контрактов. По мнению суда, Apple не оправдывает ожиданий потребителей, когда продукт рекламируется как «CO2-нейтральный». Необходимы компенсационные меры со срок действия до 2050 года. Экологическая организация Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), которая подала иск против Apple, приветствовала решение суда как успешное решение по борьбе с «гринвошингом». «Предполагаемое хранение CO2 на коммерческих эвкалиптовых плантациях ограничено всего несколькими годами, договорные гарантии на будущее недостаточны, а экологическая целостность монокультурных территорий не гарантирована», — заявил глава DUH Юрген Реш. В 2020 году корпорация Appleобъявила, что станет «углеродно-нейтральной» по всей своей цепочке поставок (включая продукцию) к 2030 году.

Причем растёт в большей степени сегмент распределенной солнечной генерации. ЮАР являлась крупнейшим импортером в отчетный период, за ней следовали Нигерия и Алжир. Однако исследование Ember показывает, что значительная часть роста отмечалась за пределами Южноафриканской Республики. В отчете приводятся данные китайской таможенной службы, подтверждающие это. За последние два года (по июнь 2025) импорт солнечных панелей африканскими странами кроме ЮАР вырос почти в три раза — с 3,73 ГВт до 11,2 ГВт. За последний год 20 стран установили новые рекорды импорта, а 25 стран импортировали не менее 100 МВт, по сравнению с 15 странами годом ранее. Алжир сообщил о 33-кратном увеличении импорта солнечных панелей за 12 месяцев, в то время как импорт в Замбии вырос в 8 раз, Ботсване в 7 раз, в Судане в 6 раз. Либерия, Демократическая Республика Конго (ДРК), Бенин, Ангола и Эфиопия увеличили импорт более чем в три раза. Рост импорта — это не просто разовый всплеск, а устойчивая структурная тенденция, утверждает Ember в своем отчете под названием «Первые свидетельства взлета солнечной энергетики в Африке». Хотя в декабре 2024 года наблюдался рекордный скачок, импорт с тех пор остается высоким. Аналитики компании утверждают, что только импортированные Сьерра-Леоне солнечные панели, если их установить, будут генерировать электроэнергию, эквивалентную 61% от общего объема выработки в этой стране в 2023 году. Исследование Ember показывает, что рост импорта солнечных панелей может значительно сократить импорт топлива, при этом панели окупаются за несколько месяцев. В Нигерии солнечная панель мощностью 420 Вт стоимостью 60 долларов США (0,14 доллара США/Вт) с годовой производительностью 550 кВт⋅ч обходится дешевле, чем дизельное топливо стоимостью 60 долларов США, способное генерировать всего 275 кВт⋅ч электроэнергии, и предполагает срок окупаемости всего 6 месяцев. Некоторые страны Африки предпринимают шаги по созданию собственных мощностей по производству солнечных панелей и компонентов, хотя речь идет, конечно, в большей степени о локализации иностранных продуктов. В том числе производства могут создаваться в целях экспорта продукции за пределы Африки, что, например, позволяет обходить торговые санкции США. В марте текущего годасообщалось, что японский производитель фотоэлектрических элементов и модулей Toyo Solar планирует увеличить свои мощности по выпуску солнечных элементов (ячеек) в Эфиопии до 4 ГВт. В 2024 году компания EliTe Solarобъявилаоб инвестициях в создание производственного комплекса по выпуску фотоэлектрических ячеек и модулей годовой мощностью 8 ГВт в Суэцкой китайско-египетской зоне экономического и торгового сотрудничества (TEDA Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone) в Египте. Первый этап строительства, который, как ожидается, будет завершен к сентябрю 2025 года, предполагает создание производства солнечных батарей мощностью 2 ГВт. Также в Египте китайская Sunrev Solar собирается построить производство солнечных панелей мощностью 2 ГВт к 2026 году. ПоданнымАссоциации африканской солнечной промышленности (AFSIA), установленная мощность солнечной энергетики в Африке в текущем году превысила 20 гигаватт. Африка, безусловно, является перспективным рынком для солнечной энергетики, который находится в начальной фазе развития. Мы ранееотмечали, что дефицит электроэнергии на континенте будет преодолеваться, в первую очередь, с помощью энергии солнца. По очевидным причинам: этодешевои быстро. Китайский бизнес, создавший избыточные мощности по производству фотоэлектрических модулей, с интересом смотрит на потенциально колоссальный рынок сбыта.

    "full_text": "Мы продолжаем отслеживать итоги индийских конкурсных отборов на поставки зеленого аммиака производителям удобрений. Уже состоялось девять аукционов, проведенных индийской государственной корпорацией солнечной энергии (SECI). Ранееотмечалось, что их результаты свидетельствуют о конкурентоспособности зеленого аммиака – цены лишь немного выше нынешних цен на «серый» аммиак. По итогам девятого конкурсного отбора победителем стала индийская компания ACME, предложившая рекордно низкую цену49,75 рупий (0,568 доллара США) за килограмм аммиака. Это уже четвертая победа ACME. В июле компаниявыигралапервый из серии аукционов, предложив у 55,75 индийских рупий (0,64 доллара США) /кг для поставки 75 тысяч метрических тонн зеленого аммиака в год индийскому производителю удобрений Paradeep Phosphates Limited в течение 10 лет. В этот раз по условиям тендера ACME будет поставлять 100 тысяч тонн NH3 в год на объект Индийского фермерского кооператива удобрений (IFFCO) в Парадипе, штат Одиша. Установленная цена составляет примерно 568 долларов США за тонну, при этом цена на серый аммиак в Индии — около 515 долларов США за тонну. Разница небольшая, и с учетом того, что цена на зеленый аммиак фиксирована на длительный срок, условия договора выглядят конкурентоспособными. SECI заявила, что проведенные тендеры «укрепили доверие, обострили конкуренцию и обеспечили конкурентоспособные по мировым меркам цены». В августе 2021 года премьер-министр Индии Нарендра Модиобъявило запуске «Национальной водородной миссии» (National Green Hydrogen Mission) с целью сделать Индию «глобальным центром производства, потребления и экспорта зеленого водорода и его производных». Миссия нацелена на производство 5 миллионов тонн зеленого водорода к 2030 году и связанное с этим развитие мощностей возобновляемой энергетики. В феврале 2022 года Индия опубликовалаполитикув области зеленого водорода / зеленого аммиака (Green Hydrogen/ Green Ammonia Policy). В рамках Миссии правительство Индии сформировало набор стимулов для «перехода на зеленый водород» — Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT). Набор включает в себя предоставление субсидий на производство электролизеров и зеленого водорода внутри страны. В 2023 году ACMEанонсировалаинвестиции в размере 270 миллиардов рупий (3,3 миллиарда долларов США) в проект завода по производству зеленого водорода и аммиака в штате Одиша на востоке Индии. Полная мощность предприятия составит 1,3 миллиона тонн зеленого аммиака в год. В 2024 году ACMEподписаласоглашение с японской промышленной группой IHI на предмет продажи 400000 тонн «зеленого» аммиака в год, начиная с 2028 года. Использование зеленого аммиака для производства удобрений — актуальная тема. В 2024 году норвежская Yaraоткрылазавод по производству зелёного водорода (крупнейший в Европе на то время), который будет использоваться для производства аммиака.

Сегодня Gentari сообщила о заключении соглашения со строительной и инжиниринговой фирмой Gamuda на предмет реализации проектов солнечной энергетики общей мощностью 1,5 гигаватт (ГВт) для снабжения электроэнергией крупномасштабных центров обработки данных (ЦОД) в рамках малазийской национальной Программы поставок возобновляемой электроэнергии предприятиям (CRESS). Солнечные электростанции будут также оснащаться системами накопления энергии (батареи), размеры которых не указываются. Программа CRESS позволяет компаниям закупать ВИЭ-электроэнергию непосредственно у генераторов с поставкой через национальную сеть. В совместном заявлении компаний отмечается, что они будут способствовать удовлетворению «неотложной необходимости» расширения мощностей ВИЭ для удовлетворения растущего спроса на электроэнергию крупномасштабных центров обработки данных в Малайзии, который, как ожидается, достигнет 5 ГВт к 2035 году. Национальная дорожная карта энергетического перехода Малайзии (NETR) предусматривает увеличение доли возобновляемой энергетики в установленной мощности энергосистемы до 40% к 2035 году и до 70% к 2050 году. В маесообщалось, что Саудовская Аравия планирует инвестировать $10 млрд в возобновляемую энергетику Малайзии. Бум строительства центров обработки данных (ЦОД) ведет к росту потребления электроэнергии. В апреле Международное энергетическое агентство (МЭА) выпустило специальныйдоклад, посвященный влиянию ЦОД на энергетический сектор. В нём прогнозируется, что к 2030 году потребление электроэнергии центрами обработки данных в мире увеличится более чем в два раза и составит около 945 ТВт*ч. Во многих странах эти растущие потребности будут покрываться с помощью возобновляемых источников энергии. Например, по китайскимнормам, дата-центры в КНР должны получать 80% электроэнергии из возобновляемых источников. В июле в Китаереализованпервый проект прямого зеленого электроснабжения ЦОД.

    "full_text": "Last Updated on:29th August 2025, 01:55 am It’s funny — I was going to write about this a few days ago, but then didn’t get to it, and then I sawLarry’s article about the US Open. First of all, I’m super happy for Larry that he was finally able to attend. Secondly, man, I wish I was there!! Thirdly, if you’re not a tennis fan, I have to explain some things before getting to the incident that triggered this article. In tennis, when it’s your service game, you have a first serve, and if you miss that, a second serve. If you miss them both, you lose the point. If something weird happens that interrupts the match after you’ve missed your first serve but before you’ve taken your second serve, it’s generally the case that the umpire lets you start over and take another first serve. The idea is that it’s unfair to the server if their mind, body, and routines are interrupted by a disturbance. Well, something very weird happened during a 1st round US Open tennis match the other night. The French player Benjamin Bonzi (ranked 51 in the world, with a career high ranking of 42 that he had risen to two and a half years ago) had gotten two sets and a break of serve up on former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev (currently ranked 13, but having risen to #1 in the world in the past). Bonzi was serving for the match and had gotten to match point. He was playing one of the best matches of his career and was on the verge of a potentially stunning upset that very few people would have bet on. Unfortunately, after he missed his first serve, one of the pro photographers walked from the corner of the court along the side of the court to the midcourt photography pit. This is, of course, not allowed, and the umpire, shocked, sort of freaked out a bit and said through the mic that this is not the time to be walking onto the court and to get off the court. Unsurprisingly, after that brief but super odd interruption, the umpire said that Bonzi got another 1st serve. Well, that completely pissed off Medvedev, who walked over to the umpire and started ridiculing him and complaining for a couple of minutes. Naturally, given that it’s the appropriate thing to do to give the server another first serve and Medvedev’s chances of winning the match were absurdly low at that point in time, the truth is that most of Medvedev’s outburst was surely due to his frustration with his own performance and the fact that he was losing the match so badly. However, this is where thingsreallygot weird. The New York crowd decided to fully get behind Medvedev and cheer him on for more than 6 minutes! This delayed the game continuously, to an absurd degree that I had never seen and the pro commentators and former payers had never seen. It was insane. From the time of the last point to the time when Bonzi was finally able to serve again, more than 10 minutes had passed! And that wasn’t even the end of it. Then, every single time Bonzi made a mistake — even the smallest kind — the crowd went wild for Bonzi. They had decided to tribalistically back Medvedev to an enormous degree. Note that this is the biggest tennis stadium in the world and Bonzi, a super mild mannered person (not normal among tennis players while they run into struggles on the court), had done nothing to turn the crowd against them. All of a sudden, tens of thousands of people were loudly cheering anytime he hit a ball into the net or outside the lines. It was insane and cruel. Match point came and went, and he lost the service game that it seemed certain he’d win 15 minutes before. He then lost the set tiebreak, all while the crowd went wild in support of Medvedev and against him. He must have been feeling completely ill treated and abused. He clearly did not take it well and then lost the next set 6-0! To not win a single game in a set, especially in men’s tennis where the server has a much bigger advantage, is very uncommon. Bonzi was having the worst experience of his life on a tennis court right after he was on the verge of having probably the biggest win of his career. He managed to compose himself again in the 5th and final set, though, and thankfully won it 6-4. If he didn’t, my goodness, how traumatizing that would have been. He was on the verge of tears in the post-match interview and was clearly not happy with the crowd. Okay, well, with all of that out of the way, what’s the relevance to what we do here atCleanTechnica? To me, it was a shocking example of how idiotic and cruel people, especially Americans, can be. It was an example of how much Americans abuse freedom of speech and freedom of expression to ruin people’s lives, act without compassion, and just act moronic. “Hey, I’m allowed to say what I want and do what I want! It’s a free country!” Yes, we are free to do stupid things, we are free to bully people, and we are free to be total jackasses. It’s America! Did Bonzi deserve to have the largest crowd in tennis ruin his night and almost ruin one of the biggest achievements of his career? No, but he was in America, so that’s what he got. Politically, we’ve seen this far too much in the past decade. We have elected a rapist (convicted), a serial fraudster, a money launderer, a mob-connected criminal, an obsessive cheat and adulterer, perhaps the biggest pathological liar the country has ever seen, and a fully certified moron. Twice. Now we have an administration and Congress repealing policies to clean our air, protect our health, preserve a livable climate, and just do good things for people. We have cancelledbillions of dollars of funding for human aidthat will result in countless human lives, and that will also lead to horrible disease outbreaks that will also lead to deaths and suffering in the United States. We’ve shot ourselves in the foot becausewe have the right to do that. Twice. The destruction to federal agencies that were set up for Americans, by Americans, to help Americans is so inane that it’s incomprehensible to me. The repeal of sensible, helpful policies that bring the United States forward and make us better economically is just what we’re doing now. The militaristic rounding up and cruel imprisonment of countless Americans — because they or their ancestors came from other countries (as if that’s not truly the case for 99.999% of Americans) — has become the norm. People cheer it on. “Love-thy-neighbor” Christians are normally the driving force behind it, eager to imprison and send to other countries they’ve never touched foot in before other Christians because they are brown and speak Spanish. And because they’ve been riled up to support this. That’s what this crazed crowd had me dwelling on. They got riled up by nonsense, and perhaps because they didn’t want to go home yet and wanted to be entertained, and it was just a reminder of how idiotically tens of millions of Americans have let themselves become enraged and misled by propaganda parading as news, thus supporting an increasingly fascist and cruel government that is even harming them —but at least entertaining them.That’s the country we live in today. That’s the world we live in today. Blind, thoughtless cruelty. Moronic tribal behavior. An insensitivity and lack of morals that we don’t even have the self-awareness to notice or feel shame for. We need to turn things around with regard to cleantech policy and sensible climate policy. However, first, we need to bring back compassion, caring for others, and a feeling of civic responsibility.

    "full_text": "The Intertubes practically blew up earlier this week when the California floating solar firm Noria Energy dropped word that work is underway on its latest project, the 50-kilowatt Aurea Solar array taking shape on a water supply reservoir in Golden, Colorado. That’s kilowatts as in kilowatts, not gigawatts or even megawatts. So, why all the fuss over such a modestly scaled project? The proximate cause of the fuss involves Noria’s proprietary AquaPhisolar tracking system. Solar trackers are commonly used to increase the productivity of land-based solar arrays. They guide solar panels into a series of optimal sun-gathering positions during the course of the sun’s journey across the sky. The floating solar industry is a relatively new development in the PV field, requiring its own suite of water-specific hardware. Solar trackers have not been high on the to-do list, and that’s where Noria has spotted an opening. The Colorado array will be the first time Noria has deployed the AquaPhi system in the US. “AquaPhi® allows floating solar systems to track the sun across the sky, by rotating the solar islands, increasing the system’s energy output by 10–20%,” Nokia explains. According to the company, the new tracking system does not require a purpose-built floating solar array. It can be slipped into plans for new solar projects, and it can be added to existing projects as a retrofit. If all goes according to plan, the Colorado project will help improve the economic case for the deployment of floating solar arrays in water systems at the large end of the scale, in addition to small-scale applications. The 50-kilowatt pilot project will be situated on Fairmont Reservoir, where it will provide Consolidated Mutual Water Company with a zero-emission source of energy for its operations. CMWC is also looking forward to benefiting from the shade cast by the solar panels, which will save water that would otherwise be lost to evaporation. The idea of situatingsolar panels on water supply reservoirshas already begun to catch on in the US, though slowly.Water system operatorssqueezed for space are among the interested parties. Eventhe US Department of Defensehas been getting into the act. Noria aims to spur the trend along with the Fairmont Reservoir demonstration, which should be up and running within the next few weeks. Noria’s timing is right on the button. Despite the sudden shift in federal energy policy this year, signs of fresh momentum in the floating solar field are beginning to materialize. In Texas, for example, earlier this month, the Houston-based floating solar startup Third Pillar Solar announced that it will investigate the potential to locate to 500 megawatts of floating solar panels in a reservoir system operated by Diamond Infrastructure Solutions, with a focus onwater conservation as well as clean energy. “The initiative marks the beginning of one of the largest floating solar undertakings in the Americas, leveraging technology designed to conserve an estimated 15% of freshwater typically lost to evaporation,” Third Pillar noted in a press statement on August 18. “The comprehensive floating solar initiative represents a potential investment exceeding $700 million and is expected to generate up to 500MW of clean energy — all while minimizing land development and helping conserve approximately 15% of freshwater currently lost to evaporation in a fast-growing, water-stressed region,” the company emphasized. If all goes according to plan, Third Pillar anticipates that it will have all projects up and running within the next five years. Saving farmland from solar developmenthas suddenly emerged as a top priority for the US Department of Agriculture, and Third Pillar works that angle as well. “This agreement demonstrates the growing appetite for utility-scale energy solutions and highlights how floating solar can enhance and transform the value of existing infrastructure, all while providing cost-competitive energy, preserving agricultural land, reducing evaporation losses, and existing out of public view,” explains Third Pillar CEO Jaimeet Gulati. With the aim ofsaving farmland from inappropriate developmentin mind, the federal government could emerge as a leading stakeholder in the floating solar field, considering that it controls enoughreservoir surfaceto host a technical potential of 1,476 terawatt-hours in solar power generation per year. That’s equivalent to the electricity demand of about 100 million US households, according to a study posted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory earlier this year. When the study was posted back in mid-January, NREL cautioned that only a fraction of that potential could be realistically recovered. Along with engineering obstacles, floating solar arrays on federal reservoirs would have to make way for recreation and habitat conservation. Still, even just 10% of 1,476 terawatt-hours would make an impressive dent in the growing gap between electricity supply and demand in the US. Unfortunately for floating solar fans, the federal reservoir door has been shut bythe new “American Energy Dominance”energy policy. Though the policy supports the hydropower, geothermal, biomass, and evenmarine energyindustries, solar energy did not make the cut. Opportunities abound elsewhere, though. Back in 2018, NREL took a look at the floating solar potential of every human-made body of water in the US. After weeding out numerous sites unsuitable for floating solar development, NREL identified 24,000 sites that couldhost enough solar panelsto provide for 10% of the nation’s annual electricity production. Electricity demand has skyrocketed in the seven years since then, and Third Pillar is among the US stakeholders meeting the moment. “The company focuses exclusively on floating solar installations on underutilized waterbodies such as wastewater lagoons, reclaimed sand and gravel pits, and industrial reservoirs to address land use concerns associated with ground-mounted solar projects,” Third Pillar says of itself, noting that it currently lists 60 floating solar projects under development in its 11-state pipeline. Circling back around to Noria, the choice of Golden, Colorado, for a first-of-its-kind demonstration of the new tracking system is not a coincidence. Golden is the host city for the NREL campus, and Noria has partnered with NREL and Idaho National Laboratory to develop theAquaPVfloating solar toolkit, aimed at accelerating uptake among the nation’s many reservoirs. Other partners in the project are the Energy Department’s Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, Oregon State University, the global risk management and certification firm DNV, the small-scale hydroelectric specialist Eagle Creek Renewable Energy, and the Cat Creek Energy pumped storage hydropower project, currently under development in Idaho.

    "full_text": "Recently, theElectric Vehicle Intelligence Reportsurveyed more than 8,000 US consumers, weighted by education, race, gender, age, income, and geography, to uncover the truth behind what’s powering or stalling the EV and self-driving car transition. There were four main conclusions from this latest survey: What that suggests is that people are weary of the constant claims from Tesla’s head honcho, Elon Musk. Before the results of this survey were made public, Elon said on his personal antisocial media channel that Version 14 of FSD, which could launch as early as next month, will be around two or three times “better than a human” driver. Version 15, when it gets here, could be 10 times superior, he said. Then, according toInvestors Business Daily, he appeared to backtrack on those statements on Monday, when he wrote, “there are so many rare situations” in real life “that even V14, while capable of being much safer than the average human driver, will take a few months to debug post release.” Longtime followers of the Tesla saga know that when Elon says “a few months,” the reality is that the promised result is more likely than not years away. “Rare situations” are what many people would describe as “edge cases” — instances when human behavior defies logic, such as a child running into the street from between parked cars while chasing a lost ball, or a truck backing suddenly out of a driveway, or the sun glinting off a shiny object in a way that disrupts the operation of a camera. EVIR says that when initially presented with a description of Tesla’s Full Self Driving functionalities and expected use, 48 percent said the technology should be illegal, 35 percent said FSD should be legal, and 17% were unsure. Younger consumers — ages 18 to 44 — and the highest income consumers with an income of $150,000 or more were more likely than average to say the technology should be legal, while older consumers — ages 65 and over — and those with incomes of less than $100,000 are somewhat more likely than average to say the technology should be illegal. 14 percent of consumers said FSD made them more likely to buy a Tesla, while 35 percent said it would make them less likely to do so. 51 percent said it made no difference to them. The recent court trial in Miami involving a Tesla Model Y that plowed though a T intersection while operating on Autopilot — a lesser technology that does not have the functionality of FSD — seems to have affected public perception of the company’s prowess at making self-driving cars. The latest reports indicate the company refused to settle the case for $60 million and instead chose to take its chances with the jury. That turned out to be the wrong decision, as the juryawarded the plaintiff a total of $329 millionin actual and punitive damages. No doubt that award will be challenged on appeal, and it will likely be years before a final resolution is reached, but we have to wonder to what extent Elon Musk was involved in the decision not to settle. He could easily believe he is entitled to $29 billion in compensation while some young woman who now happens to be dead as a result of that accident deserves little if any compensation from the company. The arrogance of the wealthy is often stunning to behold. Here are the principle conclusions of the EVIR survey: “Deep consumer skepticism around Tesla’s foregrounding of its FSD technology persists, raising doubts about whether a short or medium term market for ‘robotaxis’ and similar autonomous vehicle technologies exists. “48 percent of consumers believe Tesla’s FSD technology should be illegal, and FSD puts off more potential Tesla purchasers than it attracts by more than two-to-one. This skepticism drives consumer appetite for additional legal and regulatory guardrails around FSD and AV technology. “66 percent of consumers say Tesla should be held responsible for accidents involving its advanced driver assistance technologies, and 78 percent of consumers support regulations requiring Tesla advertisements to show proper use of Autopilot and FSD. 70 percent of consumers believe autonomous vehicles should use both LiDAR and cameras for safety, and 71 percent believe the government should mandate this standard. “Consumers do not find FSD to be a particularly good reason to buy a Tesla vehicle. Only 4 percent say Full Self Driving makes them ‘much more’ likely to purchase a Tesla, while 10 percent say ‘somewhat more.’ On the other hand, 28 percent say it makes them ‘much less’ likely to purchase a Tesla, and 7 percent say ‘somewhat less’ likely.” Musk is famously pigheaded — witness the stillborn Cybertruck that exists solely because of his intransigence and unwillingness to be guided by market research. He believes he is the smartest person not only in the room but in the entire world, and knows better than anyone what people want. That intransigence is reflected in his refusal to consider the use of LiDAR technology as part of the suite of sensors used to guide cars equipped with FSD on their appointed rounds. Several years ago, the Tesla Model 3 was placed on the back burner for about two years until Tesla engineers solved the technical issues with the falcon-wing doors for the Model X. Why? Because Musk hates the small channel in the rear quarter panel of minivans that is essential to the proper operation of sliding doors. It should be noted the latest version of the Honda Odyssey has solved that problem with an elegant solution — one that Tesla engineers might have discovered themselves if they were allowed to. Bloombergtoday is reporting that for the fourth time in seven months, Tesla posted a more than 40 percent year-over-year decline in new vehicle registrations in Europe in July. “Musk can’t blame a weak market,”Bloombergsaid. “Total car sales jumped the most in 15 months, with industry-wide battery electric vehicle registrations surging 34 percent, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.” During the Tesla earnings call in July, Musk implied that regulators were to blame for the weak sales because the companyhasn’t been allowed to offer FSD in Europe. “It’s worth noting that we do not actually yet have approval forsupervised FSD in Europe,” he said. “So our sales in Europe, we think, will improve significantly once we are able to give customers the same experience that they have in the US.” “When that day comes, exactly, remains to be seen,”Bloombergsaid. “Keep in mind that around the time Tesla opened its German factory in 2022, Musk was predicting FSD would be available in Europe the summer of that year.” Clearly, Musk is pedaling as fast as he can to keepthe illusion of FSD alive, and to the extent that he has any influence left after the DOGE dumpster fire earlier this year, he is intent on getting the federal and state regulators to lighten up when it comes to enforcing FSD reporting requirements or restrictions on its use. In other words, he is trying to game the system to his advantage. The primary takeaway from the EVIR report is simply that among the 8,000 people surveyed, Musk and Tesla are losing community support for FSD. Musk may think it is the 8th Wonder of the World, but lots of people are not buying the hype. Even he cannot force people to open their wallets to buy something they do not want. We wonder if he is even aware of that? Steve writes about the interface between technology and sustainability from his home in Florida or anywhere else The Force may lead him.

    "full_text": "The new “American Energy Dominance” policy pursues coal, oil, gas, and other 24/7 baseload power generation resources while cutting the US wind and solar industries adrift, particularly in the case of offshore wind. However, the new policy also makes ample room for other renewable energy assets to burst into full flower. The new policy embraces hydropower, geothermal energy, and biomass, and now marine energy has emerged as part of the plan as well. To be clear, the initial White House“Unleashing American Energy Dominance” announcementfrom January does not specifically list either geothermal energy or marine energy among the protected industries. However, Energy Secretary Chris Wright has made it clear that geothermal energy fits neatly into the American Energy Dominance plan. “Geothermal has tremendous potential as an energy source if we use our advanced technologies and know-how to bring this natural resource to the market,” Wright said during a geothermal industry conference in February. “This isjust an awesome resourcethat’s under our feet.” “Let’s work together to better energize our country, improve quality of life, drive AI innovation, support manufacturing reshoring, and stop rising electricity prices,” he added. The same can be said of marine energy. Like geothermal energy, marine energy — meaning the kinetic energy of currents, tides, and waves — is a vast baseload power generation resource at the nation’s fingertips, meaning that it can deliver electricity regardless of variations in weather patterns, seasons, or time of day. Like the advanced geothermal industry, the marine energy industry is alsoa newly emerging industrythat encompassesa wildly diverse roster of different technologies, and it has yet to establish a footing in mainstream energy markets. As for whether or not the US will actively support its homegrown marine energy industry, actions speak louder than words. One sign of life popped up in July, for example, when the US Department of Energy announced that marine energy has been added to the agency’s longstandinghydropower collaborationwith Norway. Another factor in support of marine energy (also called ocean energy) is its potential for use by the US Navy. By the early 2000’s, the Navy already hada grid-connected wave energy test siteup and running at a bayside location in Hawaii. More recently, the Energy Department supported the launch of a much larger,open-ocean test facilityoff the Oregon Coast. In addition, the Energy Department supports a multistate network of both water- and land-based marine energy R&D resources, available to researchers and industry stakeholders through the TEAMER (Testing Expertise and Access to Marine Energy Research) program under the direction of the Pacific Ocean Energy Trust. TEAMER has previously issued 15 rounds of awards to marine energy innovators, and it announced a 16th round earlier this week. “TEAMER accelerates the viability of marine energy by providing access to the nation’s best facilities and expertise to solve critical challenges, build knowledge,foster innovation, and drive commercialization,” TEAMER explained earlier this week, when it announced awards for 18 new projects. “These Technical Support Recipients (TSRs) will receive support for testing expertise and access to numerical modeling, laboratory or bench testing, tank/flume testing, and expertise within the growing TEAMER Facility Network,” the agency added. The selected cohort still has to submit planning documents to TEAMER before they can access the assistance they need. Assuming all goes according to plan, the program will help launch multiple renewable energy stakeholders into business, including innovators in the tidal energy and hydrokinetic fields as well as wave energy. In the wave energy category, TEAMERS included AOE Accumulated Ocean Energy Inc., Azura Wave Power, Ocean Inertia, Poseidon’s Kite, Wave Swell Energy, and Wavewatts along with HydrokinetX, which has developed a device that harvests energy from both waves and currents. Under the tidal energy banner, Aquantis, Inc. has partnered with Kelson Marine Co. and the American Bureau of Shipping on testing and risk assessment for its new tidal turbine system. The company will also partner with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to measure tidal energy potential in Alaska. Ocean currents feature in the cohort as well. The firm Equinox is relying on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to help support the deployment of its 2-megawatt deep-water current turbine, in partnership with 3U Technologies. The hydrokinetic field is represented by Blade Runner, which seeks to optimize the performance of its system in the winter when river surfaces are iced over, and Emrgy, which plans to partner with Verdantas Flow Labs to optimize its vertical axis technology. The cohort also includes R&D projects with potential benefits for multiple stakeholders, such as a wave resource modeling project hosted by Cal Poly Pier in San Luis Obispo Bay in California. In New York, Cornell University aims to develop an optimization framework for wave energy converters, while the firm Deep Anchor Solutions, Inc. will finetune its next-generation marine energy anchoring system. TEAMER makes its resources available to researchers around the world, and that is reflected in the new cohort. The Ecuadorian institution ESPOL Polytechnic University, for example, will be working on a wave energy converter tailored for the long swells characteristic of tropical regions. The University of Porto in Portugal and the University of Victoria in Canada have also won slots. The University of Victoria project is particularly interesting because it supports the potential for piggybacking wave energy converters onto offshore wind platforms, thereby sharing costs. Specifically, the school will expand upon the “Performance Optimization of a Hybrid Offshore Wind-Wave Energy Platform” funded by the EU. The US doesn’t have much of an offshore wind industry to speak of any more, but coastal infrastructure can still provide cost-sharing opportunities for marine energy. Outside of the TEAMER program, one innovator to watch is the Israeli startup Eco Wave Power. Two years ago the firm partnered with the Port of Los Angeles to introduce itswave energy harvestersto the US, and a pilot-scale project was finally ready for launch on August 27. In an interesting turn of events,Eco Wave Powerfounder and CEO Inna Braverman scored an opportunity to raise public awareness about the benefits of marine energy, arranging for the popular ABC TV newscastGood Morning Americato capture the moment when her company’s bright blue floaters were lowered into the water for the first time. “This pilot station is a vital step in demonstrating how wave energy can be harnessed using existing marine infrastructure, while laying the groundwork for full-scale commercialization in the United States,” Braverman explained in a press statement. Of note, Eco Wave Power has already begun building up its US supply chain, with the floaters fabricated by the Los Angeles firm All-Ways Metal, and installation performed by the family firm C&S Welding Inc., headquartered in Wilmington, California.

    "full_text": "What does your water heater emit as a waste product? Gross NOx pollution that goes up your flue vent? My water heater creates cool, filtered air, essentially free air conditioning that cools my house on the scorching, 100 degree, climate change hot days. It’s an amazing byproduct that most people probably don’t know about, but one that I’ve learned to harness recently to help cool my home for free in the summer. This free AC comes from our heat pump water heater (HPWH). We’ve actuallyinstalled four of them, one in our home, one in an accessory dwelling unit, and two in a duplex rental property. Heat pump water heaters work by pulling heat from the surrounding air and transferring it into a water tank. This process means that they exhaust only cool air, no gas, no pollution, just cool air (like an air conditioner). In fact you could think of aheat pump water heateras an AC system, but instead of exhausting that waste heat outside like ACs do, a HPWH uses the waste heat to heat water. This makes HPWHs extremely efficient — for every unit of energy you use, you get four units of heat out of it. It’s also why HPWHs cost so little to run — typically between $100-$150 a year in electricity costs to heat all the water your family needs. But even though we’ve been enjoying the extremely low utility bills and lots of hot water from our heat pump water heater for 8 years now, we’ve never quite mastered the art of harnessing a HPWH’s cool air in the summer until this year. That’s because for the first six plus years we owned our HPWH, we ducted its air out of our house. But after a home renovation last year, we decided to remove the ducts and have the water heater pull heat from and exhaust cool air into the house. Now, in the winter we do pay a penalty for this because the water heater is pulling warm air from your home to heat the water that has to be made up for by your heating system (in my case, ductless heat pumps). Over the years someCleanTechnicareaders have mentioned in the comments to some of my articles that this is a large penalty. It’s not. Our home still uses an insanely low amount of energy (1/5 the national average) and my space heating is provided by highly efficient heat pumps. So cool air in the winter is not a big deal. And in the summer we now get this free, delicious, air conditioning. What’s more, I’m able to do a couple tricks to run the water heater during the hottest part of the day and give me the AC exactly when I want it. Here’s what I’ve been doing. On hot days at around noon or one PM, I’ve been turning our HPWH from 120 to 140°. You can do this with the buttons on the water heater or with the app. Heating water to this higher temperature turns on the heat pumps which will run for 3 to 4 hours during the time when my solar panels are cranking out electricity. Now as a disclaimer, all of our faucets have built-in anti-scald devices which protect us from the hot 140° water. You should make sure you have the same if you try this. During the time it’s running, the heat pump water heater puts out as much cooling as a small window air conditioner (.35 tons for the HPWH vs .4 tons for a small window AC). Running my HPWH during the hot hours is thus like running a small window AC unit and not paying for the electricity. Pretty nifty! Once my water heater has reached 140°, my living room and kitchen are usually several degrees cooler and I then turn my HPWH back down to 120°. The extra hot water will be used to run the dishwasher and any evening showers and the HPWH probably won’t turn on again until the next day when we use it for more free cooling. Now, our home is one of the26% of homes nationallywhere the water heater is located within the building envelope — in a utility closet. Most water heaters are located in basements or garages where you would need to duct it to take advantage of that free AC or you might not bother. But, if your water heater is located indoors you can easily harness the free summertime cooling, all the while heating your water super efficiently on solar power (if you have panels like we do). Yet another reason to love HPWHs. Oh, and make sure to get yours before the 30% tax credit expires at the end of the year!

    "full_text": "The carbon story of cross laminated timber (CLT) is not only about how much carbon is stored in panels and buildings but also about how much is emitted in the process of getting logs from forests to construction sites. Environmental product declarations show that CLT is already net negative cradle to gate, storing far more carbon than it emits. Still, there are clear sources of emissions in the supply chain that can and should be addressed. Diesel burned in harvesters, forwarders, and trucks, natural gas in kilns, and petrochemical adhesives all add positive emissions that reduce the net benefit. With available technologies and focused policy, these sources can be largely eliminated, making the forestry chain itself close to zero emission and strengthening the climate case for mass timber. The lifecycle breakdown is instructive. Harvesting and forwarding rely on heavy diesel machinery. Transport from forest to mill is almost entirely by diesel trucks. At the mill, drying is the most energy intensive step and most kilns are powered by natural gas or diesel. Adhesives that bond lumber layers into CLT panels are fossil based resins. Factory operations are cleaner because they run largely on grid electricity, which in Canada is already relatively low carbon, but propane or diesel equipment is still sometimes used. These stages account for roughly 120 kilograms of CO2 per cubic meter of CLT in an Element5 EPD. Against that, nearly a ton of CO2 is stored in the wood, so the product is already net negative. Driving the emissions side lower simply widens that negative balance. Canada is in a strong position to act. Canada’s industrial forestry sector currently operates well below the ceiling set by sustainable forest management frameworks. The country harvested approximately 129.5 million cubic metres of industrial roundwood in 2022, while the sustainable wood supply was estimated at about 213.6 million cubic metres, meaning only about 60 percent of the allowable annual cut was utilized. This gap is even wider when looking at the area under harvest. In 2022, just 0.2 percent of Canada’s total forest area was harvested, and this value has remained under 0.4 percent over the past decade. These figures reflect both the conservatism of forest management rules and the under-utilization of the resource, largely due to lower market demand and constraints including climate-related disruptions and shifts in pipeline demand. A fifth or more of Canada’s forestry products are shipped for single-use paper and wood products, napkins, packing and chopsticks. BC’s industry ships raw logs with zero value add. Diverting more of that existing extracted lumber resource to higher value add CLT is a no brainer. This under-utilization creates a strategic window for scaling value-added wood products like CLT without threatening forest health. Harvesting more wood under existing annual cut limits can supply feedstock for mass timber factories, especially if paired with climate-smart management approaches. Indigenous partnerships, sustainable regeneration initiatives, and silviculture innovations can support increased yield while maintaining ecosystem integrity. Large volumes of residues from sawmills are underused, and much of the forest biomass left behind could be collected for energy. At the same time, Canadian forests are under pressure from climate change. Pests, wildfire, and shifting growth zones are undermining the health of forests and threatening supply. Active management is needed not only to provide sustainable feedstock for mass timber but also to adapt forests to new conditions. Climate change is both a supply challenge and a reason to modernize the forestry chain with cleaner technology and smarter data driven practices. Policy support will be critical. Converting kilns from fossil fuels to biomass boilers or electric heat pumps requires capital. Zero emission freight corridors and charging infrastructure are needed to make battery electric logging trucks practical. Research and development funding is necessary to push lignin based adhesives from pilot scale to full production. Bio chemicals can replace fossil resins but need demand pull and industrial scale facilities to achieve cost competitiveness. Carbon pricing reinforces the economics of these changes, and government procurement can accelerate them by requiring low carbon supply chains in publicly funded projects. On the ground, the actions are concrete. Biomass kilns powered by sawdust and bark close the loop, turning residues into energy instead of waste. Heat pump drying systems cut emissions further when powered by renewable electricity. FPInnovations has already trialed electric log trucks in British Columbia, showing large reductions in both energy use and emissions compared to diesel. Scaling up those trials to fleets is the next step. Lignin based adhesives are being demonstrated in Canadian plants and could replace fossil resins within a decade with the right support. Factories can run entirely on renewable energy by combining grid power with on site solar, biomass cogeneration, and storage. Digital tools can optimize harvest and hauling, reducing idling, cutting fuel use, and lowering costs while keeping operations aligned with sustainable forestry plans. Charts that show the emissions waterfall before and after decarbonization make the point clear. Harvesting, transport, drying, adhesives, and factory operations all contribute positive emissions today. Each of those bars can shrink with technology that is available or near commercial. The 2030 and 2035 adoption curves for electric trucks, biomass kilns, and bio adhesives show the pathway to near zero process emissions. When paired with the large negative bar for biogenic storage, the overall balance becomes even more negative. CLT is already carbon negative, but with an electrified and sustainable forestry chain, it becomes a material with undeniable climate benefits. There are risks. Heavy equipment fleets turn over slowly, and new electric harvesters or trucks cost more up front. Adhesive markets may take longer to shift than expected. Provinces may move unevenly on building codes and procurement requirements. Workforce development is needed to train operators for new equipment and technicians for new processes. But the enablers are strong. Federal and provincial climate funds exist. Canada’s grid will be net zero by 2035. Indigenous stewardship is aligning with industrial opportunities, bringing new partners and perspectives into forestry. Global demand for low carbon construction materials is rising, creating market pull. The conclusion is that decarbonizing the forestry chain is an industrial strategy as much as an environmental one. CLT already stores more carbon than it emits, but electrifying harvesting, hauling, and drying, moving to bio adhesives, and running factories on clean power make that balance even stronger. Canada can lead by showing that forests managed responsibly and processed with clean technology can deliver housing, jobs, and climate benefits at the same time. As climate change reshapes forestry, this shift is also a form of adaptation, making the sector more resilient while reducing its footprint.

    "full_text": "The Electric Vehicle Association of the Philippines (EVAP) will host its 13th Philippine Electric Vehicle Summit from October 23-25 at SMX Convention Center Manila, as new industry data reveals significant shifts in the country’s transportation sector. Recent Department of Energy and EVAP data shows four-wheeled electric vehicle sales reached 3,880 units in 2024, compared to 1,028 units in 2023, representing a 277.5% increase. Battery-electric vehicles accounted for approximately 75% of these sales, while hybrid electric vehicles comprised 23% and plug-in hybrid vehicles made up 2%. Two- and three-wheeled electric vehicle sales demonstrated more dramatic growth, rising from 172 units in 2023 to 43,441 units in 2024. Category L2 two-wheeled vehicles represented 93% of this segment, with Category L1 lower-power two-wheeled units at nearly 7% and Category L5 three-wheeled motor vehicles at 0.28%. EVAP President Edmund Araga attributed the growth to supportive government policies, petrol price volatility, and increased model availability. “There are currently more choices when it comes to EV models and brands,” Araga stated during the summit’s pre-event press conference in Bonifacio Global City on August 27. The Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry (CREVI) targets 7,300 EV charging stations nationwide by 2028, expanding from approximately 300 in 2023 and 992 stations recorded in 2025. Long-term projections call for 20,400 charging stations by 2040 to support an estimated 2.5 million electric vehicles. Current charging infrastructure shows concentrated deployment patterns. Department of Energy data indicates 12% of public charging stations operate within shopping malls. SM Supermalls leads with 69 stations, followed by Ayala Malls with 31, Megaworld Lifestyle Malls with 5, and Robinsons Malls with 4 stations. Most installations are located in Metro Manila. Regional distribution includes 14 public charging stations in Cebu City, 7 in Davao, and individual stations in Legazpi, Naga, and Sorsogon within the Bicol region. Additional stations are distributed across other key cities nationwide. The Electric Vehicle Incentive Strategy (EVIS), submitted by the Department of Trade and Industry in June 2025, awaits approval from the Fiscal Incentives Review Board. The strategy projects ₱11.4 trillion in economic output and up to 680,000 jobs across EV assembly, battery production, charging station installation, and maintenance services. EVIS operates under the Electric Vehicle Development Act (EVIDA), implemented in 2022 as the foundational legislation driving sector growth. In September 2024, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. inaugurated StB Giga Factory Inc. in Tarlac, marking the Philippines’ first lithium battery manufacturing facility. The plant produces advanced lithium iron phosphate batteries for renewable energy and electric vehicle applications, with planned annual capacity to power 18,000 electric vehicles by 2030. The13th Philippine Electric Vehicle Summitoperates under the theme “Charge Ahead, Ignite the EVolution.” The three-day event will feature industry discussions, innovation showcases, and new model presentations from participating manufacturers and stakeholders. “The robust EV sector is hoping that the national government would remain on track to achieving improvement in necessary infrastructure, from installing more EVCS nationwide to expanding local EV manufacturing and assembly and supporting development of innovative technologies, particularly in battery,” Araga said. The distribution of electric vehicle sales across categories reflects different consumer adoption patterns. Four-wheeled vehicle growth concentrates in battery-electric and hybrid segments, while two-wheeled vehicles show overwhelming preference for Category L2 models, which typically include electric motorcycles and scooters designed for urban transportation. Battery manufacturing development through StB Giga Factory positions the Philippines within regional supply chain networks, though production capacity remains below projected domestic demand levels based on CREVI vehicle targets. The summit convenes as Southeast Asian countries implement various electric vehicle promotion strategies. Indonesia focuses on nickel processing for battery production, Thailand emphasizes automotive manufacturing expansion, and Vietnam develops assembly capabilities, creating regional competitive dynamics in both manufacturing and market development. Philippineelectric vehicle development operates within this broader regional framework, with local manufacturing capabilities, charging infrastructure deployment, and policy implementation affecting competitive positioning. Charging station deployment data shows geographic concentration patterns, with Metro Manila accounting for the majority of installations. Provincial coverage remains limited, with second-tier cities receiving minimal infrastructure development compared to the capital region. The mall-based charging strategy provides security and accessibility benefits while concentrating installations in commercial areas. This deployment pattern aligns with current urban electric vehicle adoption trends but may influence future expansion patterns. EVAP maintains projections for continued sector growth based on existing policy frameworks, infrastructure development plans, and market entry by additional manufacturers. The organization anticipates sustained momentum through the combination of government support, private sector investment, and consumer adoption trends. Summit participants will include electric vehicle manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, battery technology companies, and government agencies involved in policy development and implementation. “The EV sector is unstoppable,” Araga concluded. “We invite all stakeholders and the general public to join us from October 23 to 25 at the SMX Convention Center Manila.” The summit represents the industry’s annual assessment of progress toward transportation electrification goals, with presentations covering technological developments, market analysis, and policy implementation updates across the Philippine electric vehicle ecosystem.

In contrast to the large, centralized power plants that defined the electricity grid of yesteryear, the modern grid of the 21st century is trending towards a hybrid model saturated with large numbers of power generation resources and related equipment scattered about the countryside, including small-scale rooftop solar and energy storage systems as well as utility-scale wind, solar, and storage assets. By supporting clean energy and grid resiliency, the DERs model also contributes momentum to other intersecting trends includingbuilding electrificationandvirtual power plants. On the ratepayer side, the DERs trend has given rise tothe emerging “prosumer” model,in which electricity users — including businesses and other entities in addition to individual households — can strategically manage their demand patterns and deploy their energy assets to save money or, in some cases, earn revenue. GDEV Management (not to be confused with the similarly named gaming company) launched its first DERs fund in 2020 and it has been flying under theCleanTechnicaradar ever since, so it’s time for some catching up. GDEV’s Fund I transactions focused on behind-the-meter resources and on-site power generation. One highlight was a partnership between the clean energy investor CleanCapital and the financial services firm Nelnet in support of the Maryland firmSunrock Distributed Generation. The company specializes in aggregating small-scale solar resources under an energy-as-a-service financing model that requires no up-front payment. In a blog post on August 26, Sunrock DG took note of impact on the clean energy and DERs trends on the building industry. “As the energy landscape shifts toward decarbonization and decentralization,distributed generation (DG)is rapidly evolving from a niche solution to a mainstream strategy. For Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) firms, this shift presents both opportunity and complexity,” the company explained. “From advanced microgrid controls to utility-scale solar and storage projects on commercial rooftops, staying competitive means understanding the trends shaping DG in 2025 and beyond,” they added. GDEV Management launched Fund II in 2022, and earlier this week the firm announced the successful conclusion of the effort with $200 million in capital commitments. “GDEV’s Fund II represents a continued focus on the firm’s strategy of building and scaling distributed energy resource (DER) platforms into mature infrastructure businesses that, in turn, deploy and operate long-term, high-value assets,” GDEV explained, taking note of its portfolio of more than 330 megawatts in new power generation along with 260 megawatts of energy storage, mainly deployed behind the meter. Although DERs assets can be grid-connected, many fall into the behind-the-meter silo, in which they shunt electricity directly to a building or other facility. “Often linked to retail prices, these assets circumvent the need for lengthy permitting and interconnection processes, leading to attractive, inflation-linked returns and faster deployment timelines,” GDEV emphasizes. The EV charging firm 3V Infrastructure is among the seven platforms supported by Fund II, and that’s where things get interesting. 3V Infrastructure deploys a charging-as-service model to unblocking the notoriousmulti-tenant EV charging bottleneck. The firm launched in 2024 with $40 million in its pocket right out of the box, and it made a key move earlier this year when it hooked up with the sprawling global real estate firm CBRE to recruit commercial property ownersinto the EV charging field. CBRE is also adding clean energy and DERs elements to the partnership, having just completed the acquisition of the North Carolina DERs firm ClearGen Holdings. “Combining CBRE IM’s strong ownership commitment with the breadth of capabilities of the CBRE platform and ClearGen’s differentiated investment strategy uniquely positions the business to accelerate growth, expand development partnerships and ensure thatdistributed energy projectsget built, CBRE explained. In contrast to the politically fraught environment of federal energy policy, GDEV points out that the intertwining clean energy and DERs trends are simply good business. “Looking ahead to the future of the GDEV franchise, we remain positive and committed to our strategy, knowing that we are well-positioned to apply our policy-agnostic approach to scale even faster, amid evolving regulatory environments,” said GDEV Managing Partner Benjamin Baker in a press statement. “Over the past five years, our focus on distributed generation, energy reliability, and retail rate-linked revenue models has remained steadfast, even as markets and legislation experience volatility,” Baker added. “For our businesses and investors, this thesis serves as a solid foundation for growth in a rapidly evolving market,” he added again for good measure. Community solar is another powerful clean energy trend that intersects with DERs. Community solar refers to solar projects that local ratepayers can subscribe to on a voluntary basis. The general idea is to make clean energy available to everyone, even if they can’t install rooftop solar panels of their own. Earlier community solar efforts made use of properties owned by local jurisdictions and other non-commercial entities. Back then, subscribers had to pay a premium for their clean energy. Now that solar costs have dropped, community solar subscribers typically save money, and that provides commercial property owners with a strong incentive to host community rooftop projects. The New Jersey firm Solar Landscape is among those fostering hookups between commercialproperty owners and community solar projects, deploying a rooftop lease model. Solar Landscape currently holds 75 million square feet of rooftop leases, providing it with an 800-megawatt clean energy portfolio. Earlier this summer the company secured a $115 million credit facility with Nuveen Energy Infrastructure Credit to support further growth over the coming years. A credit facility enables developers to tap into financing for a series of projects, without having to repeat the same paperwork each time. Nuveen EIC — a subsidiary of the powerful firm TIAA — emphasizes thatDERs is among its strategic priorities, so hold on to your hats.

    "full_text": "At the beginning of this year, energy became politicized in the United States even more than it was. As a result, it may now be that there are many clean energy situations and events that are being overlooked because they are smaller in comparison to the news about what the federal government is doing to support toxic fossil fuels. Not all energy projects in the US take place at the federal level: regions, states, counties, cities, and towns may carry on with their own initiatives. There may be a tendency for less or no attention to be paid to them, and yet they are still happening. They also are happening in multiple places continuously. Just one of them is the new solar power and energy storage system at theDenver Public Library. The energy storage companyViridiprovided the battery system.Viridi CEO Jon M. Williams answered some questions about the project. What is the solar power capacity? The solar power capacity is 172 kW (DC). What is the battery capacity and duration? The battery capacity is 100 kWh and the duration is 5 hours. Viridi’s RPSLinkEX is a lithium-ion energy storage system engineered with fail-safe anti-propagation technology that eliminates thermal propagation events—meeting Denver’s rigorous fire-safety standards for occupied public buildings like the Denver Public Library. Viridi’s RPSLinkEX product comes with a 10-yr. warranty on battery cells and 2-year warranty on all other electronic and mechanical components Were there any incentives that lowered the energy storage project cost? The IRA Investment Tax Credit typically covers 30% of the installed cost of a Battery Energy Storage System, and Viridi’s RPSLink product typically qualifies for the 10% Domestic Content adder, for a total tax credit on 40% of the installed cost of the BESS. Will the battery help save money by reducing electricity costs, and if so, by how much? Yes, the behind-the-meter system captures excess solar during the day and discharges after hours to: This means lower demand charges and reduced overall electricity costs via solar shifting and peak shaving. The Library is on XCEL’s Secondary General rate tariff and pays roughly $25/kW in demand charges, so the 20kW BESS can save up to $500 per month through peak shaving (depending on how the facility uses electricity). Will the solar and battery reduce carbon emissions, and if so, by how much? Yes, by maximizing on-site use of renewable solar and cutting grid consumption during higher-emissions periods, the project supports lower operational carbon and a cleaner, more resilient energy profile for the library.

    "full_text": "Last Updated on:28th August 2025, 10:30 am While solar energy often captures the headlines, India’s renewable energy transition is a multi-faceted effort encompassing wind, bioenergy, and cutting-edge green hydrogen initiatives. This article explores the key projects and programs that are diversifying India’s clean energy mix in 2024-2025. India is not just focused on traditional renewables but is also investing heavily in next-generation technologies through its National Green Hydrogen Mission. As noted by Invest India in a February 2025 report, this mission aims to establish a green hydrogen ecosystem, offering incentives for electrolyzer manufacturing and production. The initiative also includes pilot projects for decarbonizing “hard-to-abate” sectors like steel and transportation. A landmark project under this mission, according to EnergyMonitor.ai, is the Pudimadaka Green Hydrogen Hub, a gigawatt-scale integrated facility near Vishakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, being developed by NTPC Green Energy. In addition to hydrogen, India is also leveraging biomass as a clean energy source. The National Bioenergy Programme, with a budget of approximately $103 million, supports various bioenergy initiatives, including the National Biogas and Manure Management Programme, which leverages agricultural waste for clean energy production, as detailed in reports from the MNRE website. India is also tapping into its significant wind energy potential with new projects and policies. According to Invest India, the government is providing financial support through a Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme to encourage offshore wind projects. A tender for a 500 MW offshore wind project has already been announced off the coast of Gujarat, signaling a new frontier for Indian renewable energy. Furthermore, numerous utility-scale wind and hybrid projects are being developed across the country by various public and private entities. A recent report by JMK Research & Analytics highlighted significant capacity additions in states like Rajasthan and Gujarat, and as noted by the PIB, Tata Power has committed to investing approximately $14.4 billion in various renewable energy projects. Avaada Group has also pledged over $2.4 billion for green projects in Odisha, while other companies are pursuing large-scale solar projects in Andhra Pradesh, with Reliance Power planning an investment of roughly $1.2 billion in solar. The success of these diverse projects is underpinned by a network of government bodies and institutions. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) serves as the central coordinating body for all renewable energy policies and programs. The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), a “Navratna” financial institution under the MNRE, plays a crucial role by providing loans and financial assistance for clean energy projects. Additionally, dedicated national institutes for solar, wind, and bioenergy (NISE, NIWE, SSS-NIBE) are focused on research and development to further advance these technologies, as detailed on the MNRE website. By pursuing a comprehensive and diverse strategy, India is building a resilient and sustainable energy future that extends far beyond solar, ensuring a robust and well-rounded transition away from fossil fuels.

    "full_text": "Last Updated on:27th August 2025, 10:04 pm The new American Energy Dominance plan articulated by US President Donald Trump has been excoriated as a gift to fossil energy stakeholders. However, some Trojan Horse elements are corralled within its clauses. The new plan also stipulates federal support for the expansion of the US hydropower industry, and a massive new pumped storage facility proposed for New Mexico is about to put that commitment to the test. For all the attention lavished on lithium-ion battery technology, the fact is that good old fashioned pumped storage hydropower still accounts for the overwhelming majority of grid-scale, long-duration energy storage in the US. That’s overwhelming as in 96% as of last year. The basic concept behind pumped storage is fairly straightforward. Take some water from a lower elevation and pump it upwards to a reservoir at a higher elevation when excess power is available. When demand rises, release the water and let gravity do the work, shooting water through a turbine to generate electricity. Pumped storage has been around for decades, but its use has been limited under a fossil fuel scenario. Now that low-cost wind and solar energy have become significant elements in the US energy resource picture, the pumped storage field has new opportunities to expand. These facilities can absorb excess solar energy that would otherwise have to be curtailed during daytime peak generating periods, and they can put excess capacity from wind farms to use at night, too. In addition to providing large-scale energy storage, pumped hydropower facilities can be paired with next-generation turbine technology to provide frequency regulation and other valuable grid services. In this day and age of soaring infrastructure costs, a new pumped storage project also has a better chance of wriggling through the approval process than, say, a new Hoover-scale hydroelectric dam. Pumped storage facilities can be deployed in concert with existing dams, or they can take advantage of run-of-the-river opportunities. To the extent that environmental and habitat conservation concerns are in play, pumped storage can also provide more room for the US hydropower industry to grow. One promising area of expansion is underway in Kentucky, where a former coal field is pulling second-life duty as the host ofa giant “water battery.” The latest sign of new life for the US hydropower industry is the proposedCarrizo Four CornersPumped Storage Hydropower Center Project in New Mexico. It’s too early to tell if the project can pass muster with environmental concerns, but if a collaborative effort between the Navajo Nation and a study group spearheaded by New Mexico State University bears fruit, the Carrizo project could provide a fast-track model for others to follow. If all goes according to plan, the 1.5-gigawatt Carrizo project will be located entirely on Navajo Nation land in the Four Corners region at the border of Arizona, complete with 1.338 gigawatts of pumping capacity and 70 hours of storage duration. If 70 hours sounds like a lot of storage duration, it is. Conventional utility-scale lithium-ion battery arrays only provide for about 4 hours of storage. The question is why New Mexico needs the extra 66 hours. The answer is provided by the NMSU team leader and principal investigator, assistant professor Fengyu Wang. Lithium-ion batteries can fulfill daily grid balancing chores and other routine tasks. However, they are not particularly adept at resolving the seasonal variations that arise in a grid saturated with wind and solar energy. “The Carrizo Pumped Storage Hydropower project addresses the seasonal production-load mismatch critical for a reliable and cost-effective decarbonized grid,” Wang explained in a press statement earlier this week. “It will provide seasonal-duration storage to shift surplus variable renewable energy from spring to meet summer peak demand, and from early fall to offset winter underproduction.” Wang also notes that the Carrizo project will be the cornerstone of efforts to ensure grid reliability in the event of extreme weather or extended lulls in wind or solar availability. Along with frequency regulation, the Carrizo project is expected to provide voltage support and spinning reserve. If you caught that thing about a decarbonized grid, that’s … interesting. In effect, pumped storage acts like a giant sponge for wind and solar, which are the only two domestic energy resources that failed to make the “American Energy Dominance” cut. Nevertheless, with pumped storage hydropower enjoying federal support, the stage is set for a fresh burst of activity from the US wind and solar industries. The NMSU feasibility study is being funded by a $7.1 million award from the US Department of Energy, which the school will match on a cost sharing basis with $2 million from the Technology Enhancement Fund of the New Mexico Department of Higher Education and $1.1 million from the state’s Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, among other sources. One key sticking point, though, is the mismatch between construction timelines. Compared to the relatively quick pace of wind and solar development, hydropower projects of any sort move at a snail’s pace. However, the NMSU team is determined to give it a shot, and their effort could serve as a model for similar projects in the future. “The projectaims to fast-track Carrizo PSHlicensing and permitting by conducting market analysis, geotechnical site investigations, tunneling and excavation planning, environmental permitting, and interconnection feasibility studies,” NMSU emphasizes. For the record, hydropower not the only renewable energy resource to enjoy protected status under the new “American Energy Dominance” plan. The nation’s domestic biomass and geothermal industries also share the pedestal. The common denominator is the plan’s definition of“reliable” baseload power generation, meaning the 24/7 availability afforded by fossil-fueled power plants as well as nuclear power plants. The idea of usingwood wasteand other biomass resources for 24/7 power generation has not gained much traction here in the US, partly on account of environmental considerations as well as supply chain complications. However, the offer of support from federal policymakers could help the industry shake itself out of the doldrums, with a possible assist from emerging links between thebiochar and green hydrogenindustries. The US geothermal industry offers an even more promising area of 24/7 renewable energy generation. In past years, thepower generationside of the field has shown signs of stretching far beyond its current territory, scattered among a few areas in the western US where the necessary combination of heat, hot water, and rock occurs by accident of nature.

I feel like a kid in a candy shop looking at these! I wanted to talk with someone at CCAN Action Fund about the raffle, but also aboutwhat CCAN Action Fund does, so I got Quentin Scott, Federal Policy Director at CCAN, on a podcast call today to talk about these things. You can watch and/or listen below or on your favorite podcast network to learn more about these matters. It was a fun chat, but it definitely got a little wonky politically with regard to cleantech policies and cleantech growth in the US.

    "full_text": "Here is a story about BYD and EVs that seems straightforward. BYD has a factory in Thailand and has begun exporting cars built there to Europe. The first batch of 959 BYD Dolphin electric cars manufactured at the factory in Rayong on the southern coast of Thailand is now aboard the BYD Zhengzhou on their way to markets in Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The ocean voyage is expect to take 35 days. The BYD Dolphin is a direct competitor to the Volkswagen ID.3 and when you look at a picture of the car, it appears to be very similar in appearance, which is probably no accident. Production of the Dolphin at the factory in Thailand began on July 4, 2024. That facility has an annual production capacity of up to 150,000 units and currently employs around 6,100 people. Originally, it built only right-hand drive cars for the Thai market and other ASEAN countries, but now it has begun assembling left-hand drive units for countries whose drivers drive on the “correct” side of the road. That opens the window to export opportunities, which is important for reasons that may not be obvious. Part of the new emphasis on exports is to increase the production at the Rayong facility so it is closer to its design capability. Currently, it is producing about 60,000 units of the Dolphin as well as the Atto 3 SUV and the Seal sedan there per year — less than half of its maximum capacity. According toThe Nation, the Thai government’s EV 3.0 program provides tax incentives and subsidies to promote the sale of electric vehicles in the country. Part of that program permits cars to be imported duty free and sets the excise tax on purchases at 2% — significantly lower that the prevailing tax of 8%. It also includes purchase incentives of up to $4600 per vehicle. All those incentives are conditioned on the manufacturer producing a certain number of cars domestically to offset the number of cars it imports. According toElectrive,the offset ratio requires one locally produced car for every imported car in 2024. Although EV sales in Thailand have risen sharply — new registrations in the first seven months of this year were up more than 50% to 66,000 units — the scale of BYD’s offset obligation means domestic sales alone cannot balance its import volumes. The program has now been amended to allow more flexibility, including the option to count exports as part of the offset quota at a rate of 1.5 times. The change provides BYD with much needed relief, as it has struggled to meet the requirement with domestic sales alone. With four months remaining in the program, the company still needs to produce nearly 20,000 vehicles. BYD is Thailand’s leading EV brand and the country’s fourth largest carmaker overall, with an 8% market share. Under the government program, it must produce about 30,000 units to offset imports under EV 3.0. “Allowing exports to be counted as production offsets is an effective approach,” a BYD executive said. “If we couldn’t export, all units would have to be sold domestically, intensifying competition and distorting the market structure.” It also means the Thai government does not have to pay the $4600 EV subsidy on cars exported to other countries. Exporting EVs from Thailand to Europe also has other benefits, namely that BYD can bypass special tariffs the EU imposes on EVs made in China. Other carmakers, such as SAIC/MG, are also looking into exporting vehicles from Thailand to Europe instead of from China. BYD continues to go from strength to strength. AsZachary Shahanwrote earlier this week, “Probably one of the more interesting things to watch as BYD expands its sales globally is where the company decides to build more factories. One of those places is Malaysia. This is not a full factory, but a CKD (completely knocked down) assembly plant that BYD is building there. The first cars assembled at the plant will roll of the production lines there next year (2026).” “Malaysia has always been one of BYD’s most important markets in Southeast Asia, and today’s dual announcement of CKD and the New BYD SEAL marks a new chapter in our journey here,” Liu Xue Liang, general manager of auto sales for BYD Asia-Pacific, noted at the launch of the new BYD Seal there. Zachary added, “BYD currently has 7 stores in Cambodia as well as one service center. By the end of the year, the company aims to have 13 stores and 6 service centers. BYD is also building a vehicle assembly plant in Cambodia, which is supposed to go into operation by the end of the year as well and be able to produce 10,000 vehicles a year. That’s a drop in the bucket compared to BYD’s overall sales, but every little bit counts, and as we’re seeing, BYD is doing this kind of thing in market after market.” The company is rapidly becoming the dominant EV (and PHEV) manufacturer in the world and expanding its manufacturing capability to several countries such as Hungary, with a proposed factory in Turkey also in the planning stages. It really seems to have a crystal ball when it comes to managing the myriad policy considerations that are part and parcel of doing business internationally. If there are tariff barriers in one country, find a way to either build your cars in that country or in other countries that have more favorable trade relations. Rules change frequently, so being nimble and able to adapt rapidly to changes in the regulatory environment are essential. BYD is now selling its vehicles successfully in Europe — a market that GM all but abandoned several years ago and one that Ford is struggling with despite building cars there for decades. Part of that is attributable to BYD having a cost advantage over its European rivals, but part of it is also offering good value for the money to customers in Europe. The Yugo was cheap but it was not a good value, which lead to its sales trajectory in the US flaming out in less that two years. BYD does not intend to repeat that mistake. In fact, so far this year, itssales trajectoryhas been up strongly, while Tesla’s trajectory, particularly in China, has been down month after month. If you are looking for a glimpse of the EV future, look at what BYD is doing. Everything it does is coming up roses and there is no reason to think that trend will end any time soon.

    "full_text": "Last Updated on:28th August 2025, 11:18 am Despite anti-EV pressure from the federal government, California Governor Gavin “America’s Most Favorite Governor” Newsom continues to support the transition to zero emission vehicles, and private sector stakeholders in California continue to enjoy a mother lode of business opportunities in the EV-friendly state. The latest example comes in the area of electric truck charging, where two leading firms have partnered to break the fleet electrification movement wide open. With a tremendous amount of buying power in their pockets, fleet operators have been flexing their muscles in the electric truck field, one high profile example beingAmazon’s electric delivery vanpartnership with the startup Rivian. Fedex is another scaled-up example in the area ofelectric vans. Cracking into the market for medium-and heavy-duty electric trucks is a next-level challenge. Bigger trucks mean bigger batteries, longer charging times, and more complications for fleet operators. Some fleet operators can address the charging issue at their own private depots. Earlier this year the California Energy Commission also launched a new online dashboard aimed at providingdrivers and fleet operatorswith a single source for spotting public electric truck charging locations. Still, a new white paper from the MIT Climate & Sustainability Consortium indicates that a yawning gap in charging station availability will remain unless industry stakeholders work together to build out the public electric truck charging network. The paper was produced with input from industry representatives Prologis, Accenture and Cargill under the self-explanatory title, “Shared Electric Vehicle Charging Networks: A Flexible Approach to Support Deployment ofZero Emission Fleets.” “There are clear theoretical benefits in terms of reduced investment cost from fleets pooling investment and use of charging infrastructure,” notes MCSC Impact Fellow Danika Eamer, who co-authored the paper. “The challenge is in how different players could coordinate the planning and management of shared infrastructure,” Eamer adds. The white paper describes how stakeholders can collaborate to scale up fleet electrification. “The framework provides guidance for fleets, infrastructure providers, and other industry stakeholders to collectively plan the pooled investment and shared use of charging infrastructure — helping to ease the burden of coordination,” MCSC explains. Prologis, for one, is not waiting around for the grass to grow under its feet. Earlier today the company announceda new partnershipwith the California-based fleet electrification firm EV Realty, aimed at hitting the gas pedal on the electric truck movement. “EV Realty and Prologis Mobility plan to coordinate access to high-power charging infrastructure at regional hubs located near ports, logistics centers and major freight routes,” EV Realty explains. “Once operational, the shared access model will offer fleet operators a more consistent and scalable approach to charging across key California freight regions and corridors.” In this day and age of soaring electricity demand, the big question is where all the power will come from. A number of options have emerged alongside straightforward grid connections, including grid connections with battery storage to enable demand shifting. Fuel cells and gas hookups are also an option. I have a note in to EV Realty to see if any details are available on power sources. In the meantime, the two partners have already decided that their first two electric truck charging hubs will be up and running before the end of this year, in Vernon and San Bernardino, “with more to come across both Northern and Southern California.” Update:EV Realty has provided these additional details toCleanTechnica: “We use proprietary tools to find locations with available capacity on the grid. All of the sites we currently have under development — representing over 40MW of charging capacity — have access to grid power without major upgrades or distributed energy resources. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize sites with available grid power as they provide the lowest cost and fastest path to power without triggering costly upgrades that contribute to rising electricity rates. Smart siting allows us to work around grid constraints and continue to make progress on electrification. Infrastructure buildout is actually on pace to exceed truck deployment despite concerns over grid readiness.” Prologis is a familiar face on the pages ofCleanTechnicaand it is already on the move. Last year, for example, the company opened a new electric truck charging depot for Maersk near the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach, capable of chargingup to 96 heavy-duty trucksat the same time. EV Realty has been flying under the radar, so we’re overdue for some catch-up. The startup’s “Powered Properties” model is aimed squarely at accelerating electric truck uptake. “EV Realty was founded by a team of infrastructure development executives who built 9 GW of renewable energy projects across the U.S. over the past decade,” the company says of itself, affirming the power-first strategy behind the partnership with Prologis. “By developing shared private fleet charging hubs that service multiple commercial fleets in secure, high-power locations with dedicated charging access and availability, EV Realty ensures that companies across industriesoptimize their EV fleet operations,” they add. Of course, it’s not all about saving the planet. EV Realty promises to deliver bottom line benefits as well as a glide path to fleet electrification. “Our customers benefit from reduced costs, optimized use of available grid capacity, and an accelerated implementation timeline for EV charging infrastructure at scale,” EV Realty states. Even as anti-EV policy makers ratchet up the pressure, the state of California is going its own way as befits its status as the fourth-largest economy in the world. The industry-centered clean transportation organization CALSTART is among those taking the lead. In March, CALSTART partnered with EV Realty in a new venture aimed at leveraging the Powered Properties model to aggregate demand, thereby coordinating electric truck charging with grid optimization strategies. “EV Realty’sshared, multi-fleet charging modeloffers a scalable solution that improves fleet operator economics and provides access to high-power charging for Class 2b through Class 8 vehicles, without the costs and delays associated with utility grid upgrades,” EV Realty noted in a press statement. The partnership combines EV Realty’s power-first infrastructure planning experience with the fleet analytics portfolio developed by CALSTART. “By bringing together EV Realty’s grid-ready charging solutions and CALSTART’s ability to align industry demand, we are helping fleets make the shift to zero-emission vehicles faster and more efficiently,” added CALSTART VP Dr. Jasna Tomic. All of this activity bodes well for electric truck manufacturers in the US. The timing is especially good for Tesla, which is finally nearing volume production of its much-delayedSemi Class 8 truck. On the other hand,other truck makershave also been crowding into the Class 8 field. Tesla enjoyed a near-exclusive lock on the electric passenger car market for years following its initial launch, but the Semi will have to compete against trusted legacy truck manufacturers like Kenworth and Peterbilt (both under the PACCAR umbrella) as well asMack Trucksand a growing roster of startups. That will be…interesting. Unlike Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the heads of other electric truck firms have not left messy footprints all over the federal government. Musk’s legacy as head of the White House “DOGE” agency continues to spin out in all its misbegotten glory, offering new reasons to avoid the Tesla brand every step of the way.

    "full_text": "Last Updated on:27th August 2025, 10:32 am There’s a lot of electric vehicle growth and development happening in smaller markets that have traditionally not gotten much attention. We here atCleanTechnicaare trying to cover this growth, but, admittedly, it’s hard to track it all. The good news is that it really seems to be surging more and more, and we’ll probably all be surprised on a regular basis on how much EV sales are growing in “off-beat,” poorly tracked markets. This week, we have news from BYD on its ongoing growth and expansion in three of these markets — Nepal, Malaysia, and Cambodia. Let’s check in on what’s been going on. BYD has launched its Atto 2 (known domestically in China as the Yuan Up) in Nepal. Apparently, this is already quite a good market for BYD, as this is the seventh model BYD has launched there. It is also right on the heels of the Atto 1 (aka Seagull) launching in Nepal on August 6. The Atto 2 was launched in Nepal on August 19 at a NADA auto show in Kathmandu. It starts at 4.399 million Nepalese rupees ($31,325) there. BYD also sells the following EVs in Nepal: Atto 3 (aka Yuan Plus), Dolphin, Seal, and M6 MPV. Despite its low price, the Atto 2 has a range rating of 345 kilometers (214 miles), and it sports a larger battery than the Chinese version of the car. BYD started selling its first passenger EV in Nepal in October 2022. That was the Atto 3. However, it sold the e6 taxi there as far back as 2018. Probably one of the more interesting things to watch as BYD expands its sales globally is where the company decides to build more factories. One of those places is Malaysia. Now, this is not a full factory, but it is a CKD (completely knocked down) assembly plant that BYD is building there. The first cars assembled at the plant will roll of the production lines there next year (2026). “Malaysia has always been one of BYD’s most important markets in Southeast Asia, and today’s dual announcement of CKD and the New BYD SEAL marks a new chapter in our journey here,” Liu Xue Liang, general manager of auto sales for BYD Asia-Pacific, noted at the launch of the new BYD Seal there. The BYD Seal was the best selling electric sedan in Malaysia last year (2024), and was just launched in the country in February 2024. The new base (“Premium”) Seal starts at 171,800 Malaysian Ringgit ($40,567) in the country, and there’s a higher-trim (“Performance”) version that starts at 191,800 Malaysian Ringgit ($45,289). BYD opened its 43rd store in Malaysia just a few days ago (August 22). Cambodia — who would think of Cambodia for an electric vehicle expansion? Well, it’s a country of almost 18 million people (about three times the population of Denmark, or approximately the population of Belgium and Norway combined), and it’s ready for EVs — as everyone should be! BYD currently has 7 stores in Cambodia as well as one service center. By the end of the year, the company aims to have 13 stores and 6 service centers. BYD is also building a vehicle assembly plant in Cambodia, which is supposed to go into operation by the end of the year as well and be able to produce 10,000 vehicles a year. That’s a drop in the bucket compared toBYD’s overall sales, but every little bit counts, and as we’re seeing, BYD is doing this kind of thing in market after market, BYD reached 2,500 vehicle deliveries in Cambodia in 2025 four days ago, so a rise to 10,000 vehicles a year would be a significant increase for the automaker, but it is just the kind of foreign sales growth we’ve been expecting from BYD. BYD has been selling cars in the Cambodian market since 2020. It launched sales of the Atto 2 and Sealion 5 there earlier this year, and it expected to launch sales of the Sealion 7 and M9 in the country in October.

    "full_text": "According to a recent post on BYD’sXiaohongshu(aka RedNote) page, the YangWang U9 recently set a new EV top speed record of 472.41 km/h (293.54 mph) at ATP Automotive Testing Papenburg, a track in Germany. This comes ahead of an anticipated NÃ¼rburgring run. While most people are not in the market for a hypercar, the extreme application helps to develop EV technology. Most reports indicate that this car uses motors and components shared with theSuper E Platformfound in more approachable cars, like the BYD Han L (that only gets one 500 kW+ motor instead of 4). This platform’s 30,000+ rpm motors with an extremely wide power band likely contribute to the top speed, as well as maintaining performance and efficiency at elevated highway speeds. However, according toCnEVPost,this car will have the “world’s first mass-produced 1200-volt ultra-high voltage platform.” That would also imply more advanced SiC power electronics, which are also typically used to charge the battery in BYD cars. In addition, the 80 kWh LFP Blade Battery being put to the test here is similar to batteries used throughout BYD’s lineup, but with a more advanced cooling system. This also isn’t a one-off prototype, having already filed withMIITfor road certification in China. The development of this car benefits from the transfer of technology from mainstream cars, and mainstream cars can also benefit from technology transfer. Racing can also help to change public opinion. For example, back in the late ’60s and ’70s, at a time when the US was dominated by V8 muscle cars,BRE’sÂ racing of Datsun sedans and sports cars helped to change perceptions of the small, relatively efficient Japanese vehicles. That made people more accepting of the market shift that happened after oil prices shot up. BYD has also been realizing the potential impact of racing on consumer perception. BYD recently opened a massive,“All-Terrain Racing Track”complex in Zhengzhou, letting the company show off performance vehicles and making racing accessible to people who likely have never ridden or driven on a track before. For many people, the most exciting experience they will ever have with a car will be with an EV. People will feel the difference and get to put EVs to the test. In addition, like the Plaid drag racing videos in the US, it will help to take the wind out of ICE bragging rights. While 3000hp+ hypercars setting records can seem pointless to many, the technological development and testing can benefit more practical EVs. Racing can also go a long way toward changing consumer perceptions and building excitement for the transition to electric vehicles. Larry lives in Queens, NY, with his wife and cats.

    "full_text": "NREL Brings Together Specialists From Across the Country To Discuss Cement and Concrete for Its Third Annual Critical Technologies Meeting Cement and concrete are essential to United States infrastructure, from our roadways to the buildings we occupy. Accounting for50%of all materials produced globally, domestic production of this critical material is highly energy intensive, while relying on outdated technology and requiring imports of nearly 30 million metric tons of cement a year. In a fast-paced industry like cement and concrete, advancements are needed to modernize domestic production, improve durability, and reduce reliance on imports. Sharing the latest advances in this critical technology and encouraging key conversations among stakeholders is necessary to spark further innovation and support meaningful changes to a well-established industry. In support of this endeavor, NREL, a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratory, recently brought together more than 80 representatives from technology startups, investment firms, academia, industry, corporate institutions, and the national laboratory system in Golden, Colorado, for the third annual NREL Cement and Concrete Critical Technologies meeting on June 9–10. “NREL has the ability to engage the cement and concrete industry at any technology readiness level, from benchtop discovery to implementation, and we serve an important role to the industry as a trusted third-party to provide an honest assessment of new and emerging materials and rapidly transition them to practice,” said John Kevern, an NREL materials science researcher and cohost for this meeting. “There’s no other forum out there for cement and concrete industries to provide relatively direct comments, thoughts, and ideas back to DOE.” This two-day meeting highlighted both the challenges and promising new advances for next-generation cement and concrete technologies. This year’s focus was on the shifting landscape in the cement and concrete industry, with panels and presentations on topics like funding acquisition and venture capital, accelerated performance testing and scaling technologies to field deployment, and a Colorado-focused discussion on how the city and county of Denver, Colorado Department of Transportation, and the state architect are utilizing new procurement methods and commercial and infrastructure projects. “Innovative cement and concrete are critical because they sit at the intersection of infrastructure reliability and economic development,” said Ana Aday, Kevern’s fellow materials science researcher and cohost for this meeting. “As we face growing demands for durable infrastructure due to increased urbanization and aging construction, we need materials that perform better. Advancing new formulations, accelerating testing protocols, and enabling broader adoption of material alternatives is essential for proving out long-term durability of new materials.” In addition to panels and presentations, this year’s event featured an NREL Technology Open House, which showcased the transformative potential of NREL’s emerging technologies in not only cement and concrete but in other critical building materials like iron and steel. Participants also brainstormed in a breakout session, where this wide spectrum of stakeholders engaged in candid discussions, shared knowledge, and generated actionable ideas. “I am thrilled to see the participation of so many industry partners to make this a success,” said NREL laboratory program manager Matthew Ringer. “NREL’s ability to gather the right stakeholders shows the trust they have in this team and the shared desire to drive innovation within the cement and concrete sector.” While cement and concrete may seem like interchangeable terms, cement is the powder that binds materials together to create concrete. In baking terms, cement would be one of the dry ingredients used to make the (concrete) cake. And though cement is only a small portion of what makes up the overall concrete mixture, it is an energy-intensive production that requires modernization to meet the need for new construction and maintenance of existing infrastructure. NREL is leading efforts among the national laboratories to address this through a combination of applied research, demonstration projects, and industry partnerships. These efforts tackle critical needs, such as reducing reliance on imported cement, utilization of novel alternative materials, improving material durability, and accelerating the adoption of next-generation cement and concrete technology solutions. Some of these key initiatives at NREL include developing LignoCrete, a high-carbon cement extender derived from aviation fuel byproducts, which has demonstrated reduced thermal conductivity and good freeze–thaw durability while reducing the amount of cement in the concrete mixtures. NREL is also partnering with startups to transform industrial byproducts into advanced supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) through CO₂ mineralization. Additional research explores 3D-printed concrete for marine environments, the reuse of wind turbine blade residuals in cementitious composites for improvements in thermal and acoustic applications, and the development of “cementless” concrete and lignin-based admixtures. These efforts aim to de-risk new technologies and support the broader deployment of next-generation, resilient construction materials. “The cement and concrete industry, and the architecture and engineering community, are busy and rarely have the time or expertise to thoroughly evaluate new materials. They can become overwhelmed and aren’t able to determine which materials are viable and which are too good to be true,” Kevern said. “At NREL, we like to say this isn’t our first, second, or third rodeo. Sometimes our partners just need someone with experience to help walk them through the application of a new cementitious material or process and provide examples of where others have successfully used something similar.” With so many key players in the fast-moving cement and concrete world in one room, the goal of this meeting was to go beyond simple information sharing and allow NREL and DOE to learn about the pain points or challenges around the research, testing, and implementation needs for next-generation cement and concrete technologies in 2025. By creating a space where industry stakeholders could come together to identify actionable pathways toward accelerated innovation, Aday and Kevern hoped to collectively surface the most pressing technical and institutional barriers, such as the need for faster performance validation, better field data, and alignment around specifications and standards. Based on the depth of discussion and the strong interest in continued collaboration, this workshop successfully laid the groundwork for coordinated action and measurable progress, while NREL remains an important bridge from science to commercial application. “It’s clear that the future is being shaped by the work we do together now and that the momentum the cement and concrete industry has gained of the last few years is still going strong,” Aday said. Whether it’s unleashing domestic cement production, minimizing or eliminating imports, or securing long-term infrastructure resilience and economic growth, communication between professionals making headway in this space is critical to these advances.

    "full_text": "Welcome to another edition of US Presidents Come and Go. While the domestic solar industry is operating under a thick pall of gloom this year, plans are already in the works for a full speed revival leading up to January 20, 2029, when the current occupant of the White House is scheduled to leave the premises — peacefully one hopes, this time. The latest indication of the forthcoming PV renaissance is a new solar factory under construction in North Carolina, on track to commence operations in 2026. Considering the topsey-turvey state of US foreign relations these days, it’s worth noting that the new solar factory comes under the umbrella of the leading global firm Boviet Solar, which is headquartered in Bac Giang City in the northeastern part of Vietnam. Much water has passed under the bridge since the last US combat troops exited Vietnam, back in 1973. “U.S.-Vietnam relationshave become increasingly cooperative and comprehensive, evolving into a flourishing partnership that spans political, economic, security, and people-to-people ties,” the US Department of State noted, following the launch of the 2023 U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The CSP is described as “an overarching framework for advancing the bilateral relationship, and built on preceding Joint Statements issued over the last ten years by the two countries’ leaders in 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017,” the State Department added. Only time will tell if the Trump administration honors both the spirit and the letter of the CSP. As of earlier this summer, at least, the spirit was still in play. On June 20, the US Mission to Vietnam launched a new “30 Years of U.S. – Vietnam Relations” campaign, aimed at reaffirming and expanding ties between the two nations. “Over the past 30 years, the U.S.-Vietnam relationship has grown into a powerful partnership to advance ourshared economic and security goals,” the Mission explained. Speaking of shared economic and security goals, the new solar factory is an excellent demonstration of those things. The economic benefits to the US are straightfroward. In addition to creating new jobs within its walls, a new factory can act as an anchor institution that stirs activity throughout a community and beyond. In particular, a new solar factory has a knock-on effect that ripples into other features of the domestic solar industry, including new jobs related to academic research and technical training as well as hands-on construction and installation employment. Back in January, for example, Boviet cut the ribbon on its first solar factory in North Carolina. Located in Greenville, the sprawling 2-gigawatt solar module factory brought900 new jobsto the state. Among those marking the occasion was North Carolina Governor Josh Stein, who emphasized the big-picture role of the new factory. “As our state grows, so do our energy needs. I look forward to partnering with Boviet Solar to strengthen our workforce and build stronger clean tech infrastructure in North Carolina,” Stein said. “With nearly 110,000 people working in our clean energy sector, North Carolina ranks ninth in the nation for clean energy jobs,” added the state’s Commerce Secretary, Lee Lilley. “Boviet is a powerful addition to our supply chain that includes a roster of 220 solar companies that are helping to provide more low-carbon energy sources.” Boviet’s second solar factory in North Carolina completes the domestic supply chain picture. Also located in Greenville, the new facility will supply made-in-the-US solar cells to the first factory, which commenced operations in April. “Together, these two facilities will create a fully integrated U.S. manufacturing hub, capable ofproducing both PV cells and modules domestically, strengthening America’s solar supply chain while providing customers with top-performing, Made-in-USA solar products,” Boviet explained in a press statement. The company also noted that the second factory was initially planned as a 2-gigawatt facility. Instead, it will reach up to 3 gigawatts. The second factory is on schedule for completion midway through next year, now that the exterior walls and roof have been completed. “With Phase I already producing U.S.-made PV modules and Phase II moving forward as planned, we are building not just factories, but long-term opportunities for the local community, our employees, and the clean energy future of the United States,” said Marco Marquez, who serves as General Manager of Boviet Solar’s Greenville factory. Although the US solar industry is clearly facing headwinds today, Boviet is among the stakeholders anticipating that the setbacks are temporary. The company has dropped a strong hint that its North Carolina solar factory operations are just for starters. “The Greenville manufacturing hub is central to Boviet Solar’s U.S. growth strategy,” said Boviet Solar USA President Sienna Cen. The wheels are already in motion. Back in 2022, Boviet entered into an agreement with the US solar developer Vesper Energy, involving the supply of Boviet solar modules for Vesper projects in Ohio and Texas. Totaling 680 megawatts (AC), the Texas and Ohio projects are just part of Vesper’s16-gigawatt solar energy and storage plans. Speaking of Texas, if North Carolina wants to lay claim to the #1 go-to destination for a new solar factory, it will have plenty of competition from Texas.The solar manufacturing firm T1(formerly Freyer Battery) andMission Solarare among those moving forward with plans this year. Then there’s Tennessee, where Agriculture Secretary Brooke L. Rollins recently held a press conference in which she excoriated the use of imported solar panels, by way of announcing that her agency will no longer supportsolar loans for farmers. Not to worry, Brooke. Tennessee will do its part to ensure that farmers in search of clean power will have an ample supply of made-in-the-US solar panels on hand. The state has a secret weapon in hand, in the form of a grid-connected industrial site once intended for a nuclear power plant. The nuclear plan slid into the dustbin of history years ago, and now Tennessee is courting solar tenants, among others. First up is the US firm Highland Materials, which has hatched a plan to set upa $1 billion polysilicon manufacturing facilityat the site.

A “yardstick” to measure height is calculated with pints. In a Welcome video to the factory tour, we learn that Ben and Jerry’s gives away ice cream all day once a year. Ben and Jerry’s missionis to imparta progressive, nonpartisan social mission: they do what they can to meet human needs and eliminate injustices in local, national, and international communities. They work to integrate these concerns into their day-to-day business activities. One of their areas of focus is an acknowledgement that the manufacturing of products, by definition, creates waste. Solid waste contributes directly to greenhouse gas emissions through the generation of methane from the anaerobic decay of waste in landfills and the emission of nitrous oxide from solid waste combustion facilities. The Ben and Jerry’s team knew that ice cream manufacturing creates dairy waste too intense to send to the local wastewater treatment facility. It is illegal in the state of Vermontto disposeof organic material like food waste, kitchen scraps, into a trash bin that will go to the landfill. Everybody is legally required to send their food waste to some sort of processing strategy. What could they do todivert food wastefrom landfills and convert it into electricity to helpreduce climate change? The Ben and Jerry’s ice cream plant in St. Albans, VT can churn out over 100 million pints of ice cream a year. When it’s time to switch flavors, it takes an intensive cleaning of the pipes that push the residue into waste. Then there’s the question of what to do once the waste is collected. Food waste in landfills produces methane — a potent greenhouse gas — that can escape to the atmosphere and contributes to climate change. William Branghamreportedfor PBS how Ben and Jerry’s chose an alternative process that works a lot like our own bodies do when we eat: anaerobic digestion. The digestion process produces methane and carbon dioxide, which, if allowed to just leave the reactor would contribute to climate change, but, when it is captured and used, it’s called biogas. Think about it: how do our bodies digest the food we eat? Our guts process what we consume, right? And you’ve probably heard of the humanmicrobiome— all the bacteria, viruses, fungi, archaea, and eukaryotes that inhabit the human body. So at Ben and Jerry’s they have created, in essence, a large constructed gut. It converts high-strength organic waste and out-of-spec food products into renewable energy and clean water. PurposeEnergy and Ben and Jerry’s signed a long-term feedstock agreement in 2021, laying the groundwork for the St. Albans facility. Ben and Jerry’s sends production waste streams through a dedicated pipeline directly to the facility. PurposeEnergy CEO Eric Fitch goes on toexplainhow the wastewater goes into big tanks with bioreactors. “Inside the bioreactors, there are bacteria that just metabolize whatever we’re feeding it,” he says. It’s one of over 2,000 nationwide and receives up to 50,000 gallons a day of waste. Eric Roy, an ecological engineer at the University of Vermont, says the anaerobic digester is full of microbial life, “and that microbial life is digesting the material and turning it into methane gas, which we can then capture and use as an energy source.” Construction for the regional anaerobic digesters commenced in May 2023, and the facility began exporting electricity to the Vermont grid in December 2024. Their manufacturing plants commit to measuring and reducing their environmental impacts in four performance areas: water, solid waste, energy, and CO2 emissions. The waste goes into a methane digester, along with other farm waste, and it generates renewable energy. A big engine turns a big generator that produces electricity, goes through a transformer, and out to the grid. This system puts out a little over a megawatt, which is about enough to power 1,300 homes in Vermont. Leftover particulate matter is removed from the water. The water then goes to the local community’s water treatment plant. They remove over 99% of all the particles and contaminants in it. The digester also produces phosphorus-rich solids — a natural soil amendment. All of that phosphorus that comes into the plant from the concentratedfood waste, and they coagulate it with an iron salt. The result is iron phosphate. Employees can take it home and put it in our their gardens, as it is a useful product now for agriculture. Roy describes how the goal is to try to produce useful fertilizers and also inform best practices for how to use it, “because if nutrients aren’t used properly, they can run off to the water and cause environmental problems.” Vermont’s Lake Champlain gets algae blooms a lot in the summer, and that’s due to phosphorus loading in waterways. Dairy inherently has phosphorus in it. And so they want to make sure that the phosphorus is not getting into the watershed. “This project strengthens Ben and Jerry’s commitment to environmental sustainability by providing a long-term solution for organic waste,” said Ben and Jerry’s Global Sustainability Manager Jenna Evans. “It will reduce Vermont’s road traffic, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and decrease Phosphorous pollution.” By piping waste to the digester, Ben and Jerry’s reduces its carbon footprint. Instead of sending over 600 trucks a year out on the highways across New England to dispose of this waste, they’re eliminating hundreds of trips there and back. “This facility represents a major step forward in sustainable infrastructure for food manufacturing in Vermont,” said Erik Lallum, chief development officer of PurposeEnergy. “It’s a model of industrial symbiosis — turning food production waste into clean energy, reducing emissions, and supporting local economies.” Carolyn Fortuna, PhD, is a writer, researcher, and educator with a lifelong dedication to ecojustice.

    "full_text": "Indonesia has taken a bold and likely problematic step with the announcement of its first, early stage regulatory approval for a nuclear power project. Thorcon International, a Singapore-based developer of molten salt reactors, has received permission from Indonesia’s regulator to evaluate a site for a demonstration plant on Kelasa Island. For a country of more than 270 million people with electricity demand that is still growing rapidly, this might appear to be a turning point. Yet if one examines history, technology, and the context in which this project is being launched, the chances of it succeeding look vanishingly small. Indonesia is the world’s largest archipelago, stretching across more than 17,000 islands, with only about 6,000 of them inhabited. This geography creates enormous challenges for the national grid, which is fragmented into multiple regional systems rather than a single interconnected backbone. Java and Sumatra host most of the country’s transmission infrastructure, while many outlying islands depend on small isolated grids. Remote communities often rely on diesel generators for electricity, which are expensive to operate and create significant local pollution. Economically, Indonesia is driven by resource extraction and exports such as coal, palm oil, nickel, and natural gas, as well as a growing manufacturing sector and services economy. Tourism, fisheries, and agriculture remain important contributors, particularly on islands outside the main industrial hubs. This combination of dispersed population, reliance on fossil fuels, and economic dependence on resource sectors shapes both the urgency and the difficulty of Indonesia’s energy transition. Indonesia still relies heavily on coal, which provides about 61% of its electricity, with natural gas and oil supplying most of the rest. Renewables remain modest, with hydropower contributing around 7%, geothermal about 5%, and solar just 1%. The state electricity plan sets out 71 GW of new capacity by 2034, with about 17 GW from solar, 16 GW from hydro, and 5 GW from geothermal. Alongside this, the government has announced a target of 10 GW of nuclear capacity by 2040, marking its first commitment to nuclear power. If delivered, these additions would lift renewables to roughly 35% of the national mix while also introducing nuclear into the system for the first time. Looking further ahead, Indonesia targets 75 GW of new renewable capacity by 2035, supported by more than 10 GW of storage, reflecting the scale of investment needed to diversify away from coal and meet climate commitments. Nuclear power has only succeeded when certain conditions were in place. In the mid-twentieth century, large economies aligned nuclear energy programs with nuclear weapons programs. They standardized on one design, built dozens of gigawatt-scale plants in sequence, trained workforces through government-led programs, and maintained focus for decades. Those programs were not efficient by today’s standards, but they were coherent and well-resourced. Countries that did not follow that formula, such as Canada’s stop-start approach with CANDUs or the the last couple of decades of western nuclear reactor builds, ended up with mixed results and rising costs. Even China, which has mastered megaproject delivery, isstruggling with nuclearbecause it has spread effort across too many designs and has not locked into the necessary standardization. While nuclear advocates in the west point to China’s build out as impressive, it isyears behind on targetsand falling further behind. It only achieved its 2020 target in 2024, is still well under its 2% of grid capacity target for 2025 and its scheduled construction through 2030 will leave it tens of GW off that target. Indonesia has none of the ingredients that historically led to nuclear success. It has no prior nuclear fleet, no experience operating reactors, no large-scale nuclear workforce, no plans to build nuclear weapons and no tradition of standardized reactor builds. It’s not building dozens of standard and proven GW-scale reactors, but only 10 GW in total, starting with a 500 MW unproven design, and not necessarily repeating that one solution multiple times. So far they appear to have little political opposition to nuclear, but that doesn’t mean the bipartisan support required for a two to four decade strategic national construction program. The country is signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has eliminated highly enriched uranium that might be transferable to nuclear weapons from the countyr, so there is military strategic alignment and discipline to call upon. The choice of a molten salt reactor adds another layer of difficulty. Molten salt designs were first tested at Oak Ridge in the 1960s. They worked in the lab but ran into issues with corrosion, material embrittlement, plugging of salt lines, and complex chemistry that had to be actively managed. They never scaled beyond a few megawatts of thermal output. In recent years, startups from North America to Scandinavia have revived the concept, promising walk-away safety and lower costs. Yet not a single one has delivered a commercial plant. Thorcon itself has never built or operated a reactor, anywhere. It is proposing to build large sealed modules in shipyards and tow them to Indonesia, an approach that exists only on paper. Thorcon’s name hints that the red flag of thorium might be in the mix. Thorium has long been held out as an alternative path for nuclear energy. Thorium-232, when exposed to neutrons inside a reactor, transmutes into uranium-233, which is fissile and can sustain a chain reaction. Advocates have argued that thorium is three to four times more abundant than uranium, produces less long-lived waste, and creates inherent barriers to proliferation because the uranium-233 it breeds is contaminated with hard gamma-emitting uranium-232. Experiments dating back to the 1960s, including the Oak Ridge molten salt reactor experiment in the United States and the Shippingport breeder reactor’s final thorium core, proved that the fuel cycle was technically viable. Germany tried thorium in its pebble-bed reactor, and India built an entire nuclear strategy around its domestic thorium reserves, planning a three-stage cycle that would eventually rely on advanced heavy water reactors fueled with uranium-233 bred from thorium. Yet in every case, thorium stopped short of commercial deployment. The complexity of fuel handling, the need for an initial fissile inventory of uranium or plutonium, and the sheer momentum of the uranium-fueled reactor fleet kept thorium in the category of “promising but not delivered.” Thorcon’s original vision was built on thorium’s promise. Its very name, short for “Thorium Concept,” signaled an intention to commercialize molten salt reactors running on a thorium cycle. Early designs envisioned dissolving thorium in molten fluoride salt, breeding uranium-233 in situ, and demonstrating the fuel’s long-touted advantages. But as the company moved from concept to trying to build an actual plant in Indonesia, pragmatism set in. For a first-of-a-kind power reactor, relying on thorium would mean untested chemistry, uncertain licensing pathways, and even greater risk. Indonesia’s proposed demonstration plant is therefore designed to run on conventional low-enriched uranium fuel dissolved in molten salt, not thorium. Thorium remains a potential long-term option in the design, but the Indonesian reactor will take the easier, more familiar path to get the project off the ground. In other words, while Thorcon began as a bet on thorium, its first potential real-world deployment has been scaled back to uranium, underscoring how thorium continues to hover at the edge of nuclear power rather than forming its core. Bent Flyvbjerg’s work on megaprojects should be a warning. He has shown repeatedly that nine out of ten large projects go over budget and over schedule, and nuclear projects are consistently among the very worst. The average nuclear build is more than 100% over budget and about a decade late. Add in the fact that this is a first-of-a-kind reactor by a company with no track record, in a country with no nuclear infrastructure, and the probability of delivering on time, on budget, and at promised cost of electricity falls close to zero. Even if the project is eventually completed, it will almost certainly take much longer and cost much more than advertised, and the benefits to Indonesia will not match the rhetoric. The alternative paths are clearer and less risky. Indonesia sits on some of the world’s richest geothermal resources and has significant hydro potential. Solar costs continue to fall and the archipelago has ample land and rooftops for deployment. With investment in storage, interconnections, and grid modernization, these resources could supply reliable and cheap electricity without the risks of nuclear. International partnerships like the Just Energy Transition Partnership are already funneling billions into renewables and grid upgrades. Building out this system is not trivial, but it does not carry the weight of unproven technologies, uncertain regulation, and the specter of megaproject failure that Thorcon does. Indonesia’s decision to approve Thorcon’s site evaluation is a political signal as much as a technical step. It reflects a desire to appear forward-looking and diversified in energy options. But unless the project is radically different from every other attempt to build nuclear in similar circumstances, it will become another cautionary tale. Years will be lost, billions may be sunk, and coal may remain in the system longer because resources are tied up in a nuclear dream. A better bet would be to double down on renewables, expand storage, and build the transmission backbone to connect islands and balance supply. That path has its own challenges but rests on proven technologies already delivering results worldwide. Indonesia has made a bold gesture toward nuclear.

    "full_text": "Here is the truth the rest of the world isn’t paying too much attention to: India has emerged as a renewable energy powerhouse, transforming from a coal-dependent economy to becoming the world’s third-largest renewable energy producer in less than a decade. This remarkable transition showcases how developing nations can successfully balance rapid economic growth with sustainable energy development. The numbers tell a story of unprecedented expansion. India’s renewable energy capacity has reached 203.18 GW as of October 2024, representing 46.3% of the country’s total installed capacity of 452.69 GW. This achievement positions India ahead of many developed nations in renewable energy deployment and demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale clean energy transitions in emerging economies. The solar sector has been the crown jewel of this transformation. From a modest 9.01 GW in March 2016, India’s solar capacity skyrocketed to 97.86 GW by January 2025 — an extraordinary 10-fold increase in just nine years. This growth trajectory has established India as a global solar manufacturing and deployment hub, driving down costs worldwide through economies of scale. While solar expansion captures headlines, India’s renewable strategy extends far beyond photovoltaics. Wind power blows powerfully into the energy mix, with recent peak generation reaching 28,974 MW in January 2025. The government has committed to issuing bids for at least 10 GW of wind capacity annually from 2023-24 to 2027-28, ensuring continued diversification. India ranks fifth globally in hydroelectric power capacity, with both large-scale projects and distributed small hydro installations contributing to the renewable portfolio. The country is also exploring cutting-edge technologies, including a recent partnership between Eco Wave Power and Bharat Petroleum to develop India’s estimated 40,000 MW wave energy potential. The infrastructure development supporting this growth has been equally impressive. India now operates 58 solar parks with a combined sanctioned capacity of 40 GW, creating renewable energy clusters that optimize land use and transmission efficiency. This systematic approach to large-scale deployment has become a model for other developing nations. Recent momentum has accelerated even further. In fiscal year 2025, India added 25 GW of renewable capacity — a 35% increase over the previous year’s 18.57 GW addition. This acceleration demonstrates the maturation of India’s renewable energy ecosystem, from manufacturing and financing to project development and grid integration. There are also projects done by partnerships from foreign investments. One example is the ACEN Masaya Solar Facility. ACEN is part of the Philippine’s Ayala Group’s energy platform, a 420 MWp solar farm located in Madhya Pradesh and since 2024 has been generating a maximum of about 690 GWh of clean energy annually, preventing over 635,000 metric tons of carbon emissions. This project created about 500 jobs, and is a partnership between ACEN and UPC Solar Asia Pacific financed by a 20-year loan from the State Bank of India. The $220 million project is now selling power to the Solar Energy Corporation of India under a long-term agreement. India’s renewable achievements extend beyond domestic benefits to global climate action. The country has reduced its carbon intensity by 7% through FY24 while achieving 50% renewable energy in its grid five years ahead of target. This performance exemplifies how emerging economies can decouple economic growth from carbon emissions. The transformation has positioned India as a credible leader in international climate forums. With current renewable capacity at approximately 209 GW by December 2024, the country is well-positioned to achieve its ambitious 2030 target of 500 GW from non-fossil fuel sources, though significant challenges remain. Beyond environmental benefits, India’s renewable transition has generated substantial economic advantages. The sector has created millions of jobs across manufacturing, installation, and maintenance, while reducing dependence on fossil fuel imports. Wind power’s unique characteristic of generating nearly 60% of its output during nighttime hours complements solar generation patterns, providing pricing advantages comparable to stored solar power. India’s renewable energy journey since 2016 represents one of the most successful large-scale energy transitions in modern history. By combining ambitious policy targets with systematic infrastructure development and technological innovation, India has demonstrated that developing nations can lead global clean energy adoption while maintaining robust economic growth. As the country continues toward its 2030 goals, its experience provides a valuable blueprint for sustainable development worldwide. India has a cumulative solar power capacity of 119.02 GW as of July 2025, with ground-mounted solar plants, grid-connected rooftop systems, hybrid projects, and off-grid installations contributing to this total. The country possesses significant solar potential, receiving abundant solar radiation throughout the year. India aims to become a global leader in solar energy, driven by the National Solar Mission (NSM) launched in 2010 and supported by government initiatives like the PM-KUSUM Scheme and the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana. At the heart of India’s solar revolution are two major government schemes managed by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). The PM-Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, launched in early 2024, aims to equip a remarkable 10 million households with rooftop solar systems. According to press releases from India’s official Press Information Bureau (PIB), this program is expected to add 30 GW of solar capacity to the residential sector, providing households with free or low-cost electricity. A key component of this initiative, which has a total outlay of approximately $96 million, is the development of a “Model Solar Village” in every district, where each selected village receives around $1.2 million in central financial assistance. The PM-KUSUM Scheme is a program specifically targeting the agricultural sector that was extended until March 2026. This scheme, as noted by theEnergyMonitor.aipublication in April 2025, aims to improve farmers’ income and reduce their dependence on diesel pumps by providing financial support for the installation of 10,000 MW of decentralized solar power plants, 1.5 million standalone solar-powered agriculture pumps, and the solarization of 3.5 million grid-connected pumps. Beyond residential and agricultural use, India’s strategy also includes fostering a robust solar ecosystem through large-scale projects and domestic manufacturing. The Solar Parks Scheme, facilitated by the MNRE, promotes massive grid-connected solar power projects by providing essential infrastructure like land, power evacuation facilities, and road access. According to recent PIB and MNRE reports, as of March 31, 2025, 55 solar parks with a combined capacity of nearly 40 GW have been approved across 13 states, with over 12.8 GW already commissioned in 24 parks. To reduce import dependency, the Indian government also launched the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for High-Efficiency Solar PV Modules, a program with a budget of approximately $2.88 billion. This scheme, as reported byEnergyMonitor.ai, aims to boost domestic manufacturing, and Letters of Award have already been issued for setting up 48.3 GW of new manufacturing capacity. India’s push for solar is reflected in some of the world’s most ambitious projects. Blackridge Research highlighted several of these in its April 2025 report on upcoming renewable energy projects. One such project is the monumental Khavda Renewable Energy Park in the Kutch district of Gujarat. This 30 GW solar and wind hybrid project is set to become the world’s largest renewable energy park, with 2 GW of capacity already operational as of early 2025. In the high-altitude region of Ladakh, another landmark project is underway: a 13 GW solar power plant with a battery energy storage system (BESS). Expected to be completed by 2030, this initiative includes extensive transmission infrastructure to meet the energy needs of the Union Territory.

    "full_text": "Cross laminated timber is often presented as a housing solution, a way to build faster and more affordably while reducing the carbon locked into buildings. That is true, but it is also part of a larger story about the heavy materials industries. Every time a cubic meter of cross laminated timber (CLT) replaces concrete, the demand for cement and the demand for rebar decline. Over decades, those substitutions add up. What looks like a small shift in construction methods at the project level becomes a driver of global demand curves for both cement and steel. By bending those curves downward, CLT helps make decarbonization in the heaviest industries more realistic. The first three articles in this series established the foundation. Theopening pieceshowed that CLT and modular construction are Canada’s fastest lever to address the housing shortage and embodied emissions at the same time. Thesecond articleexplored Mark Carney’s Build Canada Homes initiative and argued that government must act as an anchor customer for CLT factories, turning policy into real square footage. Thethird articlelaid out the mass timber playbook, describing the need to integrate sawmills, bioenergy, adhesives, and logistics into a coherent value chain. This article builds on that foundation by looking outward, asking how CLT shapes the long term trajectories of cement and steel demand. For years, projections of cement and steel demand have assumed almost linear growth in line with GDP and urbanization. These models often point to mid-century peaks and flat demand well into the back half of the century. My assessment is different. The Chinese infrastructure and building boom that drove global demand in the last two decades has peaked. Advanced economies are shifting from expansion to maintenance. Efficiency gains are real and accelerating. Substitution pressures from timber, lightweight composites, and smarter design are starting to bite. Taken together, the result is that global demand for both cement and steel will peak earlier, flatten more quickly, and then decline gradually for the rest of the century. Cement is the clearest example. In mid-rise residential and parts of the commercial sector, CLT is already displacing concrete slabs and cores. Codes are evolving to allow taller timber structures and procurement policies are starting to recognize embodied carbon. Supplementary cementitious materials are being blended into mixes around the world, reducing the clinker ratio in every cubic meter of concrete. In myprojection curves, cement demand does not climb steadily to 2100. It peaks in the 2020s, flattens in the 2030s, and then declines to about a third of today’s levels by the end of the century. The drivers are substitution by mass timber where it makes sense, efficiency in design that uses less material, and caps on embodied carbon that reward lower carbon alternatives. The cuts bite hardest in residential and office buildings, where modular CLT is becoming a mainstream option. Infrastructure like highways and dams will continue to need cement, but the aggregate volumes will not offset the reductions in the building sector. In itslong-term forecast, the World Cement Association agrees that global cement demand, particularly for clinker, will peak well before mid-century and then decline significantly. The white paper suggests that demand could fall from around 4.2 billion tons in 2020 to approximately 3.0 billion tons by 2050. By mid-century, cement demand may sit at just half of today’s level, driven by slower growth in China, expanded use of substitutes and design efficiencies, and the rise of low-carbon alternatives. That outlook aligns closely with my modeling. Where most forecasts expect continual growth, WCA sees a future reshaped by material substitution and efficiency, exactly what mass timber brings to the table. As a side note, this is one of the few cases where my projections of demand decline in major industries is publicly agreed on by the industry itself. There are economic reasons for a public projection of growth even if the industry knows it’s facing decline or at minimum much slower growth. Look at oil and gas, maritime shipping, and aviation for prime examples, as well as the absurd projections of hydrogen demand growth. Steel is tied closely to cement because so much steel goes into rebar and structural frameworks for concrete buildings. As concrete declines, so does the need for rebar. Myprojectionsshow global steel demand bending downward in parallel with cement. This does not mean steel vanishes. Infrastructure, vehicles, and machinery will continue to require it, but the rebar segment will shrink steadily. The opportunity that comes with this shift is significant. A flatter and declining steel demand curve makes it possible for electric arc furnaces powered by clean electricity to dominate global production. That transition depends on scrap flows being sufficient to cover a larger share of demand. With lower total demand, the scrap available is enough to feed more of the system. In effect, the substitution of CLT for concrete not only cuts emissions directly but also makes the steel industry’s decarbonization problem easier by reducing volumes and aligning with scrap based pathways. The guiding policy that emerges from this analysis is clear. We should prioritize timber in buildings where it performs as well or better than concrete and steel, and codes and financing should favor low embodied carbon materials. Procurement should credit the biogenic storage in timber, recognizing the carbon locked away in panels for decades. Embodied carbon caps in building codes can nudge developers and designers toward materials that score better on life cycle analysis. These are not radical steps. They are practical tools that reward better choices and accelerate substitution. The actions are equally concrete. Timber should become the default for multi-unit residential buildings and mid-rise offices. Hybrid designs should replace podiums, stairwells, and cores with timber where engineering supports it. Cement mixes should be pushed toward maximum supplementary content, cutting clinker volumes wherever possible. Steel producers should double down on electric arc furnace pathways, aligning recycling infrastructure and scrap collection with projected demand. Taken together, these steps lock in the displacement of cement and steel in the building sector and make the heavy industry decarbonization challenge manageable. Risks remain. If codes evolve too slowly, substitution will lag. If insurance markets resist, adoption will be slower. Incumbent industries will continue to defend their markets. Lumber supply volatility and land management controversies can undermine the case for mass timber if not handled responsibly. At the same time, the enablers are strong. CLT costs are coming down with scale. Government procurement can lead by example. Investors are focusing on embodied carbon as part of ESG mandates. Export markets, particularly in the United States and Europe, are opening quickly to mass timber solutions. The conclusion is that CLT is one of the sharpest knives we have to cut into global cement and steel demand, reducing the challenges of dealing with emissions from those hard-to-abate sectors. It is not the only lever, but it is a powerful one that compounds over decades. By displacing concrete and the rebar inside it, CLT bends both curves downward, turning what looked like an impossible decarbonization climb for heavy industry into a slope that can be managed. My projections for cement and steel through 2100 reflect this reality. Cement peaks soon, declines steadily, and ends the century at about a third of today’s levels. Steel flattens, declines, and transitions to an electric arc furnace dominant industry powered by clean electricity and abundant scrap. These curves are not just numbers. They are pathways to aligning housing, economy, and climate in a way that makes the future less daunting and more achievable. is a climate futurist, strategist and author.

    "full_text": "Bill McKibben, the tireless environmental advocate, first came to prominence with his book,The End Of Nature,in 1989. His new book,Here Comes The Sun, pays homage to the George Harrison song of the same name. OnMcKibben’s website, you will find this description: “Here Comes the Suntells the story of the sudden spike in power from the sun and wind—and the desperate fight of the fossil fuel industry and their politicians to hold this new power at bay. From the everyday citizens who installed solar panels equal to a third of Pakistan’s electric grid in a year to the world’s sixth-largest economy — California — nearly halving its use of natural gas in the last two years,Bill McKibbentraces the arrival of plentiful, inexpensive solar energy. And he shows how solar power is more than just a path out of the climate crisis: it is a chance to reorder the world on saner and more humane grounds. You can’t hoard solar energy or hold it in reserves—it’s available to all.” We have been having quite adiscussion about solarlately here at the funhouse we callCleanTechnica, fueled by lots of thoughtful and insightful comments from readers. Yesterday we discussed the surge in personal solar installations in Pakistan and what it may portend for the traditional utility model in which the company owns the electricity and only shares it with others if they can pay for it. Solar has the potential to upend that model or skip right over it in some cases. Today, a report byEmber Energysays much the same thing that is happening in Pakistan is happening in Africa as well. It says Africa’s solar panel imports set a new record in the 12 months from June 2024 to June 2025. In that 12-month period, 15,032 MW of solar panels were imported to Africa — a 60% increase over the 9,379 MW imported in the preceding 12-month period. Much of the increase in the last 12 months took place in countries other than South Africa. In the rest of the continent, imports of solar panels tripled from 3,734 MW between June 2023 and June 2024 to 11,248 MW in the 12 months from June 2024 to June 2025. “The increase in imports is more than a single month spike,” Ember says. “Monthly imports jumped to a record in December 2024, but have consistently elevated since. While the December surge initially raised questions — potentially driven by Chinese manufacturers meeting year-end sales targets — the data now indicates this is part of a broader, structural trend.” The surge did not occur only in one country. Algeria rose 33-fold in the 12 months to June 2025, compared to the previous 12 months. Zambia rose eight-fold, Botswana seven-fold, Sudan six-fold, and Liberia, DRC, Benin, Angola, and Ethiopia all more than tripled. China exports a lot of solar panels, but at the same time, it is installing more domestically than any other nation. In the first six months of 2025 alone, China installed new solar systems with a total capacity of 210 GW, according toRenewable Energy Industry News. That makes it the first nation to reach that level. China’s economic and industrial policy consistently focuses on renewable energy, battery storage, and electric transportation. The Chinese government wants to reduce the high import risks and geopolitical dependencies associated with fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal in order to operate on global markets from a position of industrial strength. CleanTechnicareaders are all above average and so they know that China also has the dubious distinction of building more coal-fired generating stations than any other nation. How does that square with its clean energy intentions? A partial answer is that coal is a tactical strategy to keep the economy humming until the strategic goal of renewable energy can catch up. Is that cynical? Perhaps, but it may also be seen as practical. The way China operates, all those coal-powered facilities don’t have to continue in operation for the entirety of their useful life. If they get shuttered prematurely because they are no longer needed, that will happen. China has a plan to be 100% renewable by 2060. That is ten years later than other countries. The difference is, China can be expected to actually meet its target, while those other nations will still be doling out truckloads of good intentions in 2060 with no real progress made between now and then. According toChina Daily, the expansion of renewable energy will continue in the coming years. Based on the country’s 15th Five-Year Plan (2026–2030), the CEC expects an annual increase of 200 to 300 GW in renewable energy capacity. In total, China’s installed power capacity is expected to rise to around 3.9 TW by the end of 2025 — up 16.5% compared to the previous year. At the same time, it expects electricity consumption in 2025 to increase by about 6%. By the end of 2025, total solar capacity in China is expected to reach 1,300 GW. “The solar power produced in China in 2025 alone will already account for about half of the annual electricity generation of all nuclear power plants operating worldwide,” said Dr. Norbert Allnoch of Internationales Wirtschaftsforum Regenerative Energien (IWR). By the end of the decade, the IWR expects solar capacity in China to reach as much as 2,500 GW — more than the total of all global nuclear power production. “But that’s merely a side effect,” Allnoch emphasized. He said China aims to further expand its leading position in the future sectors of renewable energy technology, storage technology, and electric transportation, while gradually reducing its dependency on fossil fuels. If only other nations would sign on to that sort of policy goal. All this good news about solar energy meshes well with what Bill McKibben has to say in a recent interview withNewsweek, which asked why more people are not aware of the rise in solar power. He said, “I think it’s because we’ve spent so long calling this stuff alternative energy that it got stuck in a corner of our brain and became difficult for people to imagine. You read endless stories about all the different kinds of possible alternatives, small nuclear reactors and tidal power and geothermal, all of which are interesting, but none of which are scaling in any significant way. “Meanwhile, this is so obviously the economic way forward that it’s, almost without people paying attention, has just snuck up on everyone. It happened very fast—that’s the other thing. You know, it’s only maybe five years ago that we crossed some invisible line where this stuff became cheaper than burning coal and gas and oil. So, this is a different world than the one we’ve lived in.” He talked about how people for a long time have been trying to find ways to make fossil fuels more expensive — after all, they pay nothing for the waste products they produce. “Now we’re in this upside-down world where renewable energy is cheap and fossil energy is comparatively expensive. And I think the first people to really figure out the true dynamics of this world were in the oil industry, who understood it for the threat that it was.” What gladdens the heart of this Vermont-based environmental campaigner is that California is burning 40% less methane to generate electricity that it did just 2 years ago, thanks in large measure to the abundance of solar energy produced within its borders. “You’ve got to figure that for the oil industry, that’s a scary number. That really indicates the kind of pressure that they’re starting to feel. “And I think that that explains more than anything else their unprecedented involvement in our political life. And so, to me, that’s sort of the ultimate back-handed compliment to the renewable energy boom — the fact that big oil is clearly freaked out and doing everything they can to slow it down.” The cracks are beginning to appear in the fossil fuel business model. AsMichael Barnardreported earlier this month, “Wall Street’s six largest banks have cut their financing to oil, gas and coal projects by 25 percent year-on-year through August 1, 2025. In dollar terms, that means about $73 billion this year versus roughly $97 billion in the same period in 2024.” Take all this news and tie it up and what have you got? A glimpse of the future that includes a lot less fossil fuels, despite the efforts of the current administration to drag the US back to the 19th century. Somewhere, Adam Smith is smiling, as his economic theory is being proven to work exactly as he said it would — cheaperer is betterer. The age of fossil fuels is not already over mostly because of the enormous political influence the industry has bought with itsbribescampaign contributions. But in the end, none of that will matter.

    "full_text": "The Intertubes have been buzzing over the northern white rhinoceros, now that National Geographic has turned its documentary lens on a high-tech mission to bring a new generation of the all-but-extinct two-horned creatures to life. Progress has been inching along at a pace that would put a snail to shame, but it is progress nevertheless, and the new documentary could help foster a renewed burst of public support for habitat conservation efforts around the world. The white rhino rescue team works under the umbrella of the Germany-basedBioRescueproject, and they have their work cut out for them. Only two northern white rhinos are left on Earth, which makes the rescue effort difficult enough. To make the task of teasing out another generation all but impossible, both are females. Nevertheless, the advanced state of 21st century reproductive science is the key that keeps the possible alive. To get an up-close look at that, check out the new National Geographic documentaryThe Last Rhinos: A New Hope, now streaming onDisney+ and Hulu. During an online press conference last week, BioRescue Director Jan Stejskal discussed the impact of his team’s work on the potential for rescuing other species. However, he also emphasized that the delicate, painstaking labwork behind the northern white rhino project is a rescue mission of last resort, made necessary by failed attempts at habitat conservation and species preservation. “It’s true that habitat conservation gets precedence, but in some cases all of these steps were already tried and they didn’t work,” Stejskal toldCleanTechnica. “A new approach was needed for the northern white rhino.” In addition to suffering from the impacts of habitat encroachment in Central and East Africa, northern white rhinos were murdered by poachers and caught in the crossfire of wars. The two remaining females,Fatu and Najin, are living out their lives at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. The lessons of the northern white rhino for other nations around the world are clear, particularly here in the US where habitat conservation has taken a back seat to other concerns of the current administration. Nevertheless, some pockets of continued progress on habitat conservation still exist. One good example is the emerging field of agrivoltaics, in which rural solar arrays are designed to accommodate pollinator habitats, native species restoration, or livestock grazing (or all three) as well as food crops for human consumption. Agrivoltaic arrays can function as a farmland conservation tools, habitat conservation tools, or both. Farmers who lease their land to an agrivoltaic developer can earn a reliable income stream to provide financial support, helping to avoid bankruptcy and enabling the land to remain viable for agricultural operations. Although solar critics oppose the use of farmland for solar arrays, ground-mounted solar panels have a light footprint. They can be removed at the end of their lifespan and the entire site can be returned to agriculture. In fact, solar arrays cover a vanishingly small percentage of farmland in the US. Historically and up to this day, the overwhelming cause ofpermanent farmland lossin the US is real estate development, withlow-density housingemerging as a main cause alongside tract homes, warehouses, malls, and other buildings. Farmland also intersects with habitat conservation in the field of regenerative agriculture. In contrast to the soil-impacting, chemically dependent monocrop strategies that underpin conventional industrial-scale agriculture, regenerative strategies reflect indigenous practices that focus on soil health, biodiversity, and water conservation. The leading farmland conservation organization American Farmland Trust supports regenerative farming, both as as complement to agrivoltaics and as a standalone practice.”Well-managed farmland supports wildlife and biodiversity, cleans our water, increases resilience to natural disasters like floods and fires, and helps combat climate change,” AFT explains. “In all senses of the word, farmland sustains us. Yet we are losing it at an alarming rate. And on land that continues to be farmed, we are also losing ground—quite literally. We have lost billions of tons of topsoil.” the organization emphasizes. Among other activities, AFT offers a regenerative farming microgrant program. One showcase for the program is a livestock farm in New England, where an AFT grant supported the replacement of a sprawling thicket ofinvasive and non-native specieswith pollinator-friendly native species. AFT is just one among hundreds of non-profit land trusts in the US, organized under the umbrella of theLand Trust Alliance. “Most land trust projects start through the generosity of private landowners, and many of these lands are open to the public,” LTA explains. “In fact, 80 percent of land trusts provide public access to their protected lands, according to the 2020 National Land Trust Census, amounting to 1.2 million acres of land and 9,761 miles of trails open to the public,” LTA adds. Along with hiking and biking opportunities, open-access land trusts can provide communities with a long list of quality-of-life services including guided nature walks and classes as well as farmers markets and community gardens, among many other activities. “Land trusts do not do this work alone. They partner with libraries, gyms, community centers, farmers co-ops, local businesses, extension agents, schools, hospitals and other nonprofits to connect people with the land in ways that are meaningful to them,” LTA emphasizes. In some cases, land trusts also work with local, state, and federal agencies to transfer private land to public ownership. Some examples cited by LTA include the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy (transferred 105 acres of forest to the Pennsylvania Game Commission); Black Swamp Conservancy in Ohio (gifted a mix of farm, forest, and wetland along the Sandusky River to the Sandusky County Park District); The Bitter Root Land Trust in Montana (transferred 70 acres of river bottom to the City of Hamilton); and The Trust for Public Land (transferred 15 square miles in New Mexico to the federal Sabinoso Wilderness Area). “The project represents the largest land donation to a federal wilderness area in U.S. history and will help increase public access to this remote area,” LTA notes, referring to the Sabinoso transfer. These local habitat conservation efforts are more valuable now than ever before.

    "full_text": "Uganda is widely known for being the land of hundreds of thousands of motorcycle taxis (boda bodas) — buzzing around transporting millions of passengers. Uganda also has a special place in the history of boda bodas. That’s because, over 50 years ago,Ali Mayende’s innovation in the border town of Busia sparked a revolution that has become the lifeblood of East African public transport. As detailed in that article from African Arguments, Ali Mayende began ferrying passengers from Busia, a small town on the edges of Eastern Uganda, to the border with Kenya in the 1960s. Others followed, giving birth to the boda boda industry. Now a big phenomenon on the African continent, the motorcycle taxi industry is attracting huge attention and investment. These motorcycle taxis are the heartbeat of the passenger and small goods transport system in a lot of countries in Africa. Close to 30 million motorcycles on the continent are used in this motorcycle taxi industry. With almost 99% of them still being internal combustion engine motorcycles, there is a huge opportunity and a large addressable market for electrification. The move towards electric vehicles in Africa, especially in this electric motorcycle sector, has mainly been driven by the private sector by small startup companies. Most of the developments in Africa’s electric motorcycle sector have been concentrated along what is now known as the “boda belt.” The boda belt, a term coined by Tom Courtright, is a stretch of countries on the African map where motorcycle taxis have been prominent over the years. This belt stretches from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to the outskirts of Dakar, Senegal. There is also significant activity in North African countries such as Morocco, where smaller scooters are used mainly for personal transportation, unlike in East Africa and West Africa, where most of the activity is for commercial transport purposes. One of the pioneers in Africa’s electric motorcycle sector, fittingly, started in Uganda! I have been following developments in the African electric mobility sector for about a decade now and every time I get an update on what’s going on somewhere on the continent, I get so excited, as it gives us an insight into how much progress has been made over the past couple of decades. Having been on the ground and speaking with founders of hundreds of electric mobility startups and other firms all over the African continent, I always feel confident to say that the transition to electric mobility in Africa will happen a whole lot faster than most people realize. That’s because it has been developed by locally-based companies tackling real pain points and everyday problems faced by public operators and other stakeholders that make up their key target market — all developed from the ground up without much in terms of government subsidies like we’ve seen in other developed markets around the world. Uganda-basedZembowas one of the startups that kickstarted the electric motorcycle taxi revolution on the African continent. Zembo started with an initial pilot phase from 2017 to around 2020. Zembo then launched version 2.0 of its motorcycle and batteries from 2021, adding 30 swap stations. It is now working on expanding to over 2,000 active riders and over 80 battery charging and swap stations in 2025. We have a great update from Uganda on Zembo’s impact, a lovely example to show how far along the transition to electric is in Uganda.According to news coming from Uganda, Zembo’s electric motorcycles are contributing to record electrification numbers in the last-mile delivery sector for partners such as Glovo. Glovo recently celebrated a milestone of 5 years operating in Uganda. As part of the celebrations, Glovo opened a new headquarters in Kampala and highlighted that about 40% of Glovo’s couriers now ride electric and there are plans to raise this to even higher levels soon, which will have a big impact on their mission to reduce emissions. Already, Zembo’s fleet in general (including riders outside the partnership with Glovo) is contributing to lower carbon emissions. Zembo’s website says each Zembo bike avoids 1.5 MT of carbon emissions annually — 7.5 MT over the bike’s lifetime. To date, Zembo’s fleet has resulted in 2,195,945 kg CO₂ reduced, over 1,000 drivers powered, and these drivers have covered 37.9 million km. There is also a great financial incentive for the riders to switch to electric motorcycles, as riders can save up to $500 annually on operational and fuel costs. According to Zembo’s website, “Zembo’s lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries offer a range of up to 80 km on a single charge, providing the performance riders need for their daily work. Built with safe and stable LFP technology, these batteries are designed for years of reliable service. They are also among the most affordable options on the market, costing just UGX 6,000 (USD 1.65) per swap. Zembo’s network in Uganda currently features 30 stations strategically located across the country, with plans to double this number by next year. These stations are conveniently situated at popular fuel stations, ensuring easy accessibility for all riders.”Zembo adds that its motorcycles are designed to withstand diverse terrains, rough roads, and heavy usage associated with boda boda utilisation requirements. So, the birthplace of the boda boda electrification pioneered by players such as Zembo. Uganda is actually a great place for electrification of motorcycles, and vehicles in general. According to Uganda’s electricity regulatorERA, the country’s installed electricity generation capacity has been on an upward trend for over a decade. This has been driven by the commissioning of various renewable energy projects, mostly hydro generation projects. Notable ones over the past 5 years include the commissioning of Isimba (183 MW) and Karuma (600 MW) hydropower plants. By the end of Q2 2024, Uganda’s installed capacity had reached 2,048.1 MW, a 63.7% increase from 1,251 MW in 2019. This is pretty impressive. Uganda’s generation mix itself is quite clean. ERA says as of the second quarter 2024, renewable energy projects contributed 95% of all generation capacity of the total installed capacity (2,048.1 MW). Hydroelectricity had the largest share, accounting for 84%. That means a growing number of electric motorcycles in Uganda charge on a grid dominated by renewables. With maximum demand in Uganda hovering at about 1,000 MW, there is a lot of room to grow demand from the electric mobility sector to boost uptake of this excess capacity, ultimately boosting revenues for electricity generation firms. Energy purchases in Uganda by the various consumers were just over 6,000 GWh at the end of 2023, driven mostly by large industries and residential consumers. Zembo is playing a key role in Uganda’s clean mobility sector. “Powered by renewable energy: Wherever Zembo operates, we rely on renewable energy sources to power our bikes. In Uganda — where 96% of electricity comes from renewables — Zembo utilizes the abundant waters of the River Nile to drive sustainable mobility solutions.” Remeredzai Joseph Kuhudzai has been fascinated with batteries since he was in primary school. As part of his High School Physics class he had to choose an elective course. He picked the renewable energy course and he has been hooked ever since.

Experts believe these advances could:Reduce the carbon footprint of existinghydrogen productionsetups,Fuel fresh investments insustainable energytechnologies,Solidify South Korea’s lead inzero-emission technology.Collaboration, Funding, and the Road AheadThis project was powered by support from the Korean Ministry of Science and ICT’s Mid-Career Research Program and Nano Material Technology Development Program. Key players likeDr. Dongkyu Leeon the experimental side andDr. Joonhyun Namdriving the computational work were instrumental. While lab results look rock-solid, the next big step is scaling up to pilot reactors and weaving this oxide into real-world systems.Industry observers point out that going from gram-scale trials to multi-ton production units means smart engineering tweaks, in-depth longevity tests, and detailed cost breakdowns. Still, this move toward much faster discovery and high performance charts a clear path: rapid iteration cycles, richer material libraries, and tighter feedback between digital design and hands-on experiments.What This Means for Hydrogen InfrastructureFor utility companies,fuel cell technologydevelopers, and transport or power-generation folks, a heat-driven, emission-free route to H2offers serious flexibility. It can fill in when renewables-driven electrolysis hits a wall, and it pairs beautifully with solar thermal or waste-heat systems. As hydrogen storage matures and fuel cell costs drop, having diverse feedstock options is crucial for building a resilient, large-scalehydrogen infrastructure.Plus, with global hydrogen demand expected to surge by over 500% by 2050 in some scenarios, unlocking cost-effective, carbon-neutral pathways has never been more urgent. Innovations like(MgMnCo)0.65Fe0.35Oycould shift the economics in favor of trulygreen hydrogen, accelerating both adoption and the broader energy transition.Looking ForwardIt’s easy to get bogged down in metal ratios, redox cycles, or screening algorithms. But the big takeaway is this: marrying cutting-edge computation with targeted lab work can fast-track our march to carbon neutrality. As thePOSTECH–SNUcollaboration gears up for industrial trials, we’ll be watching to see how quickly this discovery translates into real-world, zero-emission hydrogen production facilities.

    "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report As the morning sun peeks over Theta Pond atOklahoma State University (OSU)in Stillwater, there’s a buzz aboutclean energyrippling through campus. After more than a century of oil rigs humming across red-dirt fields—from Muskogee to the Panhandle—towns like Tulsa, Bartlesville and Stillwater are setting their sights on a fresh frontier: naturally occurringwhite hydrogen. It’s the latest chapter inOklahoma energy research, where the pumpjack’s steady beat is making room for the promise ofnatural hydrogen.With nearly four million residents and over 500,000 legacy wells threading beneath our feet, Oklahoma already has a head start. On August 25, 2025, OSU’sCollege of Engineering, Architecture and Technology (CEAT)kicked off a year-long, grant-funded initiative backed by theOSU Hamm Institute for American Energy. Their mission? Map, quantify and evaluate white hydrogen’s long-term viability—building a data-driven foundation for future extraction, production and deployment.Mapping the Invisible: Characterizing Natural HydrogenLeading the charge isDr. Prem Bikkina, whose knack for subsurface resource evaluation is well known. He’s joined by geoscience prosDr. Priyank JaiswalandDr. Javier Vilcaez Perez, and together they’re piecing together:– Historical seismic lines from the Anadarko and Arkoma basins– Core samples pulled from wells drilled as far back as the 1920s– Advanced isotope ratio mass spectrometry to sniff out hydrogen anomalies– Magnetotelluric surveys and remote sensing to sharpen structural modelsBy training machine-learning algorithms on global analogs, they’ve already bumped prediction accuracy by roughly 70%. Their target: deliver high-resolution maps by month six, pinpointing a dozen “sweet spots” where pressure, purity and reservoir connectivity all line up. Those maps will guide pilot drills and sustainable well designs.Innovative Extraction: A Game-Changer Under ExplorationGreen hydrogen usually starts in a water electrolyzer, but white hydrogen bubbles up naturally from deep rock formations—no giant electrolyzer required. Early assays show in-situ purity levels north of 95%, which could be a real cost-saver. Here’s how the CEAT team plans to tap into it:– High-precision downhole sensors to monitor hydrogen pressure shifts– Proton exchange membranes in modular separation units to purify soft streams– Compact compression systems built for handling lightweight gas safelyThe goal is maximum recovery with minimal surface disturbance and water use. Of course, these methods haven’t been tested at scale yet, and debates continue about how quickly natural hydrogen reservoirs refill. To keep things sustainable, extensive pressure monitoring and conservative drawdown tests are baked into the plan—ensuring solidhydrogen sustainability.Challenges and Next StepsNo trailblazing effort sails completely smooth. Key hurdles include:– Evolving regulations: Hydrogen well standards are still in flux– Environmental safeguards: Rigorous impact studies and community buy-in are must-haves– Cost curves: Membrane and compression gear need to get cheaper before hydrogen can compete with natural gasTo tackle these, CEAT is forming a policy advisory panel with the Oklahoma Energy Office, theU.S. Department of Energyand local conservation groups. They’ll host roundtables with landowners and tribal nations to build trust. Come the final quarter of the grant year, two proof-of-concept sites will fire up—delivering real-world data on flow rates, price tags and environmental footprints. By mid-2026, a full feasibility report should point the way to multi-million-dollar follow-on funding and private-sector partnerships.A Glimpse into the Future: Sustainability and LeadershipPicture this:• Power Generation: Swapping out half of Oklahoma’s gas-fired turbines for hydrogen ones, cutting CO₂ by up to 45%.• Transportation: Fuel-cell buses and big rigs slashing urban smog by 70–80%, boosting public health.• Grid Storage: Gigawatt-hours of hydrogen reserves smoothing out wind and solar peaks.• Industry: Chemical and steel plants switching to hydrogen, chopping Scope 1 emissions and trimming costs.By locking arms with theDepartment of Energy’sHydrogen Hub initiative, Oklahoma could become a regional anchor—pipelines, refueling stations, manufacturing centers and all. It’s a blend of economic diversification and genuine climate resilience.Empowering Tomorrow: Training, Collaboration and Economic ImpactThis white hydrogen adventure isn’t just about geology and engineering; it’s about people. Over the next year, CEAT—partnering with theBoone Pickens School of Geology—will:– Engage 30+ graduate students in reservoir modeling, geochemistry labs and policy analysis– Offer 20 undergraduates internships in field sampling, data management and environmental monitoring– Host workshops uniting energy companies, regulators, tribal leaders and conservation groups“Building local expertise is what makes this real,” saysDr. Javier Vilcaez Perez. “We’re not just discovering hydrogen; we’re cultivating the workforce to roll it out responsibly.” Expect new service companies—designing wells, crafting sensors, auditing environments—to pop up, potentially creating hundreds of sustainable jobs across all 77 counties.A Regional Network with Global PotentialOSU’s white hydrogen initiative is the first of its kind in the U.S., but it’s part of a worldwide wave. From Australia to Europe, researchers are mapping natural hydrogen seeps and trading data through emerging consortia. By standardizing reporting and jointly testing extraction methods, OSU plans to export its know-how globally—fast-tracking theclean energytransition and cementing Oklahoma’s place in a low-carbon future.As each rig drills a new hole and every isotope reading comes in, we inch closer to unlocking a clean, abundant energy source right beneath our feet.

Key hurdles include:– Evolving regulations: Hydrogen well standards are still in flux– Environmental safeguards: Rigorous impact studies and community buy-in are must-haves– Cost curves: Membrane and compression gear need to get cheaper before hydrogen can compete with natural gasTo tackle these, CEAT is forming a policy advisory panel with the Oklahoma Energy Office, theU.S. Department of Energyand local conservation groups. They’ll host roundtables with landowners and tribal nations to build trust. Come the final quarter of the grant year, two proof-of-concept sites will fire up—delivering real-world data on flow rates, price tags and environmental footprints. By mid-2026, a full feasibility report should point the way to multi-million-dollar follow-on funding and private-sector partnerships.A Glimpse into the Future: Sustainability and LeadershipPicture this:• Power Generation: Swapping out half of Oklahoma’s gas-fired turbines for hydrogen ones, cutting CO₂ by up to 45%.• Transportation: Fuel-cell buses and big rigs slashing urban smog by 70–80%, boosting public health.• Grid Storage: Gigawatt-hours of hydrogen reserves smoothing out wind and solar peaks.• Industry: Chemical and steel plants switching to hydrogen, chopping Scope 1 emissions and trimming costs.By locking arms with theDepartment of Energy’sHydrogen Hub initiative, Oklahoma could become a regional anchor—pipelines, refueling stations, manufacturing centers and all. It’s a blend of economic diversification and genuine climate resilience.Empowering Tomorrow: Training, Collaboration and Economic ImpactThis white hydrogen adventure isn’t just about geology and engineering; it’s about people. Over the next year, CEAT—partnering with theBoone Pickens School of Geology—will:– Engage 30+ graduate students in reservoir modeling, geochemistry labs and policy analysis– Offer 20 undergraduates internships in field sampling, data management and environmental monitoring– Host workshops uniting energy companies, regulators, tribal leaders and conservation groups“Building local expertise is what makes this real,” saysDr. Javier Vilcaez Perez. “We’re not just discovering hydrogen; we’re cultivating the workforce to roll it out responsibly.” Expect new service companies—designing wells, crafting sensors, auditing environments—to pop up, potentially creating hundreds of sustainable jobs across all 77 counties.A Regional Network with Global PotentialOSU’s white hydrogen initiative is the first of its kind in the U.S., but it’s part of a worldwide wave.

I’ve been fortunate enough to have been a writer for Hydrogen News for over 15 years, and I still enjoy every moment of it. The subject matter is something that I’m extremely passionate about, and I believe that passion comes through in my writing. When I was younger, I used to play tennis quite a bit. Nowadays, however, I’ve set my sights on a new sport called pickleball. It’s a bit of a craze at the moment, but I’m absolutely hooked. Whenever I’m not writing articles or doing research, you can often find me on the pickleball court. It’s a great way to stay active, and I always have a blast playing with my friends. I’m always striving to improve my writing and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the industry. I believe that writing is a journey of constant improvement, and I’m excited to see where that journey will take me next. Whether I’m writing about hydrogen news or the latest pickleball trends, I always aim to bring my unique perspective to the table and create content that engages and entertains my readers. My prediction. When white hydrogen begins to make the mainstream, Wind and Solar will be phased out of existence. W7S are cost prohibitive against the cost of white hydrogen.Reply Your email address will not be published.Required fields are marked*Comment*Name*Email*WebsiteΔ This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.Learn how your comment data is processed.

    "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report SWITCH Maritime LLCsnagged a$2 milliongrant fromNYSERDAto roll out and trial New York City’s first 150-passengerhydrogen fuel cell-electric ferry. Slated for runs on the East River, thiszero-emission technologyvessel aims to replace diesel boats on key commuter and tourist routes, pushing the city further along itssustainable energyjourney. By tapping operational data from San Francisco’s “Sea Change” ferry, SWITCH Maritime is setting out to prove thathydrogen fuel cellsaren’t just feasible—they can scale up to meet urban demand. This award is one of five projects under NYSERDA’s$11 million Advanced Fuels and Thermal Energy Research Program, a clear signal of New York’s commitment toindustrial decarbonization.Strategic ImpactWe’re truly at a crossroads where decarbonizing public transit has jumped from whiteboard concept to real-world action. ForSWITCH Maritime, this grant is a thumbs-up for its “zero-emissions-as-a-service” model—bundling vessel leasing, on-shorehydrogen infrastructureand crew training into one neat package for ferry operators. City and state agencies are eyeing quieter waterfronts and cleaner air corridors, which have historically ranked among the region’s worst pollution hotspots. Since ferry routes have been pollution hotbeds for years, this shift also promises tangible public health benefits for waterfront communities. With diesel costs still on a rollercoaster, operators could see genuine savings on fuel and maintenance. By shouldering up-front costs,NYSERDAis smoothing the way for wider market adoption and setting a blueprint that other regions can follow. If all goes as planned, SWITCH could leverage this showcase to reel in more orders and partnerships, cementing its reputation as a go-to provider ofhydrogen fuel cellvessels.Policy ContextThis initiative sits squarely under theClimate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which demands steep greenhouse gas cuts across every sector. Through NYSERDA’s Advanced Fuels Program, state funds and leveraged federal resources team up to de-risk early-stage clean energy demonstrations and accelerateindustrial decarbonizationin maritime transport. While permit pathways from California’s hydrogen vessel approvals offered a helpful shortcut, New York still needs to fine-tune local codes to match evolvinghydrogen infrastructureand safety standards.NYC Waterways & Emission ChallengesSince the 19th century, ferries have been the unsung workhorses of New York’s transit network—but for too long they’ve relied on diesel engines that kick up soot, roar like thunder, and puff out nitrogen oxides. Shuttling millions of passengers annually, these vessels are vital commuter arteries, yet they’ve become some of the area’s worst polluters. Switching gears tozero-emission technologyisn’t just about dodging fines—it’s a public health win and a savvy hedge against unpredictable fuel markets. This move also underscores the importance of building robusthydrogen infrastructureto support sustainable waterways.Lessons from San Francisco’s “Sea Change”In July 2024,SWITCH Maritimelaunched theSea Change, the first hydrogen-powered passenger ferry in the U.S., cruising at speeds up to 25 knots. That pilot taught us plenty: from refueling protocols and supply chain tricks to smarter maintenance cycles. Riders noticed snappier acceleration and regulators gave props to a 50% drop in acoustic footprint compared to diesels, helping clip months off New York’s permitting timeline. Today, on-shore storage and distribution plans in NYC are being modeled closely on that San Francisco playbook.Technical SnapshotHere’s the gist: the new ferry will stash compressed hydrogen—up to 700 bar—in onboard tanks, feeding a Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell that generates electricity for quiet, direct-drive motors. With a 150-seat layout and 25-knot top speed, it promises diesel-like performance but only emits water vapor. On land, modular refueling stations and dedicated storage tanks will slot right alongside existing docks, cutting down on civil works. Looking ahead, SWITCH is already sketching a 300-passenger RoPax concept and a liquid hydrogen version with leading European yards.Collateral Benefits & ChallengesSpeeds up broader adoption ofzero-emission technologyin public transit.Chops down air and noise pollution in densely populated waterfront areas.Kicks localhydrogen infrastructuredevelopment into high gear, creating green jobs and bolstering supply chain resilience.Sets benchmarks for retiring aging diesel fleets across U.S. ports.Short-term hurdles include aligning safety regulations, managing capital outlays, and scaling the refueling network.Main InsightsThis grant is one of five under NYSERDA’s $11M Advanced Fuels and Thermal Energy Research Program.A 150-passenger capacity, 25-knot performance, and water-only emissions tick all the boxes for city operators.The “zero-emissions-as-a-service” package trims complexity by bundling vessel, fuel, and training into one solution.San Francisco’sSea Changeproject provided critical data on refueling speed and rider acceptance.Parallel DevelopmentsAcross the pond, Norway’sMF Hydraliquid hydrogen ferry is charting new territory, and SWITCH’s upcoming RoPax project aims to replicate that success on U.S. waters. Countries like Japan and South Korea are also ramping up hydrogen ferry trials, underscoring a global shift toward maritimesustainable energy. Thanks to California’s early adopter status, a lot of regulatory groundwork is already in place—but New York’s busier harbor will be the real test. Private investors and transit agencies nationwide are watching this demo closely to shape their own fleet-renewal strategies.Looking AheadTrials are slated to kick off by mid-2026, with full service rolling out after a successful shake-down period. If the ferry meets its performance and cost targets, New York could certify dozens more vessels, reshaping maritime mobility and cementinghydrogen fuel cellsas a cornerstone of urbansustainable energysolutions. Meanwhile, SWITCH Maritime is already lining up follow-on pitches to operators up and down the East Coast, aiming to drive unit costs down through greater scale.About SWITCH MaritimeFounded in 2018,SWITCH Maritime LLCdevelops, finances, and leases battery andhydrogen fuel cellvessels for both public and private operators.

Through NYSERDA’s Advanced Fuels Program, state funds and leveraged federal resources team up to de-risk early-stage clean energy demonstrations and accelerateindustrial decarbonizationin maritime transport. While permit pathways from California’s hydrogen vessel approvals offered a helpful shortcut, New York still needs to fine-tune local codes to match evolvinghydrogen infrastructureand safety standards.NYC Waterways & Emission ChallengesSince the 19th century, ferries have been the unsung workhorses of New York’s transit network—but for too long they’ve relied on diesel engines that kick up soot, roar like thunder, and puff out nitrogen oxides. Shuttling millions of passengers annually, these vessels are vital commuter arteries, yet they’ve become some of the area’s worst polluters. Switching gears tozero-emission technologyisn’t just about dodging fines—it’s a public health win and a savvy hedge against unpredictable fuel markets. This move also underscores the importance of building robusthydrogen infrastructureto support sustainable waterways.Lessons from San Francisco’s “Sea Change”In July 2024,SWITCH Maritimelaunched theSea Change, the first hydrogen-powered passenger ferry in the U.S., cruising at speeds up to 25 knots.

    "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Ever thought battery-powered drones were the ultimate solution for emission-free flight? Well, guess what: the Netherlands Aerospace Centre (NLR) just flipped the script withliquid hydrogen. On August 18, 2025, theirHYDRA-2drone took off in the Netherlands on nothing but a cryogenic liquid hydrogen system. Teaming up withCryoworld, this breakthrough opens doors to longer missions, full-onzero-emission technologyoperations and even hints at manned hydrogen flights on the horizon.Breakthrough Test FlightThe HYDRA-2’s debut unfolded at NLR’s North Holland test site, a hotbed of aerospace know-how. Piloted remotely, the drone climbed without a hitch and settled into a smooth, stable forward cruise—outlasting its battery-electric and compressed-gas cousins. The real star? Cryoworld’s vacuum-jacketed composite tank. It held hydrogen at a frosty –253°C, slashed boil-off losses and kept pressure rock-solid throughout. This wasn’t just a first for the Netherlands; it’s a clarion call for regulators and policymakers to craft standards aroundsustainable energyfuels.Inside the TechnologySo, what’s under the hood? HYDRA-2 packs a lightweight, vacuum-jacketed composite tank built from carbon fiber reinforced polymers with next-gen liners. Multi-layer insulation fends off heat, limiting boil-off to just a few percent per day. Compared to metal vessels, it’s about 30% lighter—freeing up weight for extrahydrogen storageor mission-specific payloads. Thanks to Cryoworld’s engineering chops, the tank checks all the boxes for aviation safety: pressure, impact resistance and thermal cycling.From the tank, liquid hydrogen feeds ahydrogen fuel cellsstack—specifically, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) module that splits H₂ into protons and electrons to generate clean electricity. That power drives an efficient electric motor, with water vapor as the only byproduct. Even the waste heat gets a second life via a thermal management loop, boosting efficiency and cutting back on extra cooling needs. In flight, a web of sensors feeds live data—temperatures, pressures, flow rates—to an onboard computer that tweaks power delivery on the fly. With up to five times the specific energy of batteries, hydrogen fuel cells give HYDRA-2 a serious edge on endurance missions.Evolution of Hydrogen AviationHydrogen in aviation isn’t new, but storage has long been the roadblock. Back in 2019, NLR’s HYDRA-1 demo used compressed hydrogen, and while fuel cells worked, high-pressure tanks limited airtime.

Their composite storage solutions drive breakthroughs in aerospace, energy and scientific research around the globe.Spread the love The HYDRA-2’s debut unfolded at NLR’s North Holland test site, a hotbed of aerospace know-how. Piloted remotely, the drone climbed without a hitch and settled into a smooth, stable forward cruise—outlasting its battery-electric and compressed-gas cousins. The real star? Cryoworld’s vacuum-jacketed composite tank. It held hydrogen at a frosty –253°C, slashed boil-off losses and kept pressure rock-solid throughout. This wasn’t just a first for the Netherlands; it’s a clarion call for regulators and policymakers to craft standards aroundsustainable energyfuels. So, what’s under the hood? HYDRA-2 packs a lightweight, vacuum-jacketed composite tank built from carbon fiber reinforced polymers with next-gen liners. Multi-layer insulation fends off heat, limiting boil-off to just a few percent per day. Compared to metal vessels, it’s about 30% lighter—freeing up weight for extrahydrogen storageor mission-specific payloads. Thanks to Cryoworld’s engineering chops, the tank checks all the boxes for aviation safety: pressure, impact resistance and thermal cycling.From the tank, liquid hydrogen feeds ahydrogen fuel cellsstack—specifically, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) module that splits H₂ into protons and electrons to generate clean electricity. That power drives an efficient electric motor, with water vapor as the only byproduct. Even the waste heat gets a second life via a thermal management loop, boosting efficiency and cutting back on extra cooling needs. In flight, a web of sensors feeds live data—temperatures, pressures, flow rates—to an onboard computer that tweaks power delivery on the fly. With up to five times the specific energy of batteries, hydrogen fuel cells give HYDRA-2 a serious edge on endurance missions.Evolution of Hydrogen AviationHydrogen in aviation isn’t new, but storage has long been the roadblock. Back in 2019, NLR’s HYDRA-1 demo used compressed hydrogen, and while fuel cells worked, high-pressure tanks limited airtime.

    "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Picture powering your favorite smart shirt with fabric as soft and flexible as cotton thread. In a freshNaturepaperdropped on August 19, 2025, researchers unveiled a breakthrough infuel cell technology: a gel-encapsulated, fiber-shaped platform for next-gendirect methanol fuel cellsthat you can bend, snip, and top up in under a minute. It packs an eye-popping161.36 Wh/kgenergy density, runs smoothly from−22 °C to 70 °C, and sails through over2,000 flexing cycles. That’s a huge leap in weaving high-energy power intowearable electronics—bringing us a big step closer to uninterrupted, seamless juice for our gadgets.Market ContextAs the race for compact, reliable power in health monitors, emergency kits, and the exploding Internet of Things heats up, traditional batteries and rigid fuel cells just don’t cut it. You might get flexibility from solid-state batteries, but they often fall short on energy density. On the flip side, conventional PEM and phosphoric acid fuel cells deliver high output, but only in bulky housings. This new fiber approach leans on a clever gel matrix that self-reinforces under pressure, ditching oversized chambers and setting the stage for truly conformal power in next-genwearable electronics.Strategic ImplicationsIf you’re eyeing thewearable electronicsor smart textile market, this could flip your playbook. Imagine cutting fuel cell “threads” to size, weaving them into garments, then refueling on the fly at room temp—no clunky equipment required. OEMs and textile pros could embed power directly into clothes, slashing weight, complexity, and e-waste. Even aerospace, robotics, and defense teams stand to gain, thanks to a lightweight, refuelable system that laughs off mechanical stress and temperature swings—a real edge in high-stakes, mobile scenarios.Business OutlookMethanol’s no stranger to the global stage—it’s traded in volumes topping 100 million tonnes a year through natural gas reforming and emerging bio-based routes. That means businesses can tap an existing fuel network instead of betting on new hydrogen stations. These gel-wrapped fibers skip pricey extras—no high-pressure tanks or electric compressors—chopping upfront CapEx. For manufacturers, integrating gel-infused threads into textile or composite lines slots right into current weaving and coating setups, keeping unit costs competitive with premium lithium-ion modules. Plus, direct methanol fuel cells boast lower lifecycle emissions than battery production, making them a prime candidate for sustainability incentives or carbon credits. With governments tightening emission targets, jumping on thisclean energytrain could unlock better financing, speed up approvals, and get your next-gen systems to market faster.Technical SnapshotUnder the hood, it’s a simple cotton mesh soaked in a methanol-friendly gel. When fuel meets matrix, the gel swells, cranks up internal pressure, seals fuel channels, and locks down electrode interfaces. Here’s the skinny:Energy density:161.36 Wh/kg—blowing past older fiber-based cells.Mechanical resilience:2,000+ flex cycles with zero fuss.Thermal range:−22 °C to 70 °C—ready for extreme environments.Refuelling:Under 1 minute at ambient conditions—no tools needed.Parallel DevelopmentsOf course, this isn’t the first rodeo forfuel cell technologyor flexible materials. Over the last decade, pioneers toyed with carbon nanotubes and polymer electrolytes, cranking out prototype supercaps and fuel cells that bent okay but tripped up on sealing and power.

    "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Picture this: you catch sunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, then simply whip out a magnet to fish the catalyst right out. No, it’s not sci-fi—that’s exactly whatspinel ferritesare promising forphotocatalytic water splitting. Fast-forward to June 2025, and researchers are boasting record-breaking efficiencies withMFe2O4(M = Zn, Ni, Co, etc.) nanoparticles. Sure, front-runners likeTiO2andCdSbroke the initial ground, but their wide bandgaps and iffy stability under sunlight limited their real-world clout. These days, spinel ferrites tick every box: they’re made from abundant elements, flaunt narrow bandgaps (~1.9–2.2 eV), and shrug off harsh reaction conditions. By fine-tuningsol-gel processing, weaving in clever dopants, and building smart heterostructures, we’re edging ever closer to commercial-scalegreen hydrogen. Bonus: wrapping these nanoparticles in a conductivepolypyrroleshell is giving them a durability and performance boost that’s hard to ignore.How spinel ferrites workThe real trick lies in the spinel crystal lattice, where octahedral and tetrahedral sites host iron and transition-metal ions in a neat 1:2 ratio. Variants likeNiFe2O4,CoFe2O4, orZnFe2O4tweak their electronic bands just enough to nail the ideal redox potentials. Shine sunlight on them and you get electron-hole pairs: the electrons bust down water to H2, while the holes oxidize it to O2. But the coolest part? These babies are magnetic. After the reaction, you run a magnet around the reactor wall and voilà—the catalyst particles stick like magic, ready for the next round. That magnetic recoverability slashes separation costs and vibes perfectly with broadersustainable energygoals.Engineering breakthroughs: sol-gel, doping & heterostructuresScientists have known forever that uniform nanoparticles make all the difference. That’s wheresol-gel synthesisshines, churning out ferrite particles under 50 nm with spot-on stoichiometry—think higher active surface areas and fewer pesky trap states. Then there’s doping: swapping in Zn or Ni at the M site tweaks the band edges, driving hydrogen evolution rates north of 150 µmol H2∙g–1∙h–1under one sun (100 mW/cm2). And let’s not forget heterostructures—pairing spinel ferrites withTiO2, BiVO4or carbon nitride creates type-II junctions that steer electrons and holes to different zones, cutting recombination losses like a hot knife through butter. One study on mixedNiZnFe2O4/g-C3N4composites reported a 45% bump in turnover frequency compared to unmodified ferrites, proving the power of interface engineering.Polypyrrole nanocomposites amplify performanceWhile spinel ferrites nail light absorption and charge generation, coating them with a conductive polymer likepolypyrrole (Ppy)really turbocharges the deal. By polymerizing it in situ, you get a thin Ppy layer hugging each nanoparticle, creating a slick electron highway and shielding the core from nasty oxidative damage. The result? Some lab setups have doubled their hydrogen output, and they’re still rocking over 90% activity after five-plus cycles.

On the manufacturing side, cranking out tens of kilograms of sol-gel–synthesized nanoparticles with consistent quality? Easier said than done. But pilots are already in motion: academic teams teaming up with engineering firms to build 1–5 L photoreactors that circulate magnetic catalysts in thin films for top-notch photon capture. Hit those performance milestones, and we could see commercial-scale pilot stations by late 2026.Environmental and collateral impactsCue the reality check: mining nickel and cobalt can be resource-intensive and polluting if it’s done without care. That said, compared to cadmium-based catalysts, spinel ferrites dodge some major toxicity concerns. Plus, magnetic recovery keeps more catalyst in play and trims waste disposal headaches. A full life-cycle assessment would weigh mining impacts against CO2savings from ditching grey hydrogen. Early estimates hint at over a 70% cut in greenhouse gas emissions, even after factoring in feedstock extraction.Looking aheadSo, arespinel ferritesthe game-changer forhydrogen production? They’re not a one-size-fits-all silver bullet, but they’ve certainly earned their spot on the shortlist. As synthesis methods mature, interface tweaks sharpen, and scale-up kinks get ironed out, these catalysts might one day rival traditional electrolysis—without relying on pricey noble metals. What we’re seeing is a steady climb toward a sunlight-driven, trulysustainable energyfuture, and trust me, we’re just scratching the surface.Spread the love The real trick lies in the spinel crystal lattice, where octahedral and tetrahedral sites host iron and transition-metal ions in a neat 1:2 ratio. Variants likeNiFe2O4,CoFe2O4, orZnFe2O4tweak their electronic bands just enough to nail the ideal redox potentials. Shine sunlight on them and you get electron-hole pairs: the electrons bust down water to H2, while the holes oxidize it to O2. But the coolest part? These babies are magnetic. After the reaction, you run a magnet around the reactor wall and voilà—the catalyst particles stick like magic, ready for the next round. That magnetic recoverability slashes separation costs and vibes perfectly with broadersustainable energygoals. Scientists have known forever that uniform nanoparticles make all the difference. That’s wheresol-gel synthesisshines, churning out ferrite particles under 50 nm with spot-on stoichiometry—think higher active surface areas and fewer pesky trap states. Then there’s doping: swapping in Zn or Ni at the M site tweaks the band edges, driving hydrogen evolution rates north of 150 µmol H2∙g–1∙h–1under one sun (100 mW/cm2). And let’s not forget heterostructures—pairing spinel ferrites withTiO2, BiVO4or carbon nitride creates type-II junctions that steer electrons and holes to different zones, cutting recombination losses like a hot knife through butter.

    "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report EMSTEELhas teamed up withAldar PropertiesandMasdarto roll out the MENA region’s first-ever hydrogen-based steel rebar for Abu Dhabi’s debut net-zero carbon mosque in Masdar City’s Sustainable District on Yas Island. This 1,595 sqm sanctuary, designed to welcome over 1,300 worshippers, sits at the heart of a masterplan for smart, low-carbon urban communities. This delivery not only pushes the mosque closer to its goal ofLEED Zero Carbon certificationbut also shines a light on the power of public-private teamwork and the UAE’s fast-track sprint toward its 2050 net-zero targets and broadersustainable energygoals.Key InsightsThis project is the first big-scale application ofgreen hydrogenin steelmaking across the region, chopping CO₂ emissions by up to 95% compared to traditional blast furnaces.Back in October 2024,EMSTEELandMasdarran a pilot that churned out 5,000 tonnes of certified green steel, proving the concept works at scale.Aldar Propertiesearns bragging rights as the region’s first developer to use hydrogen-based steel in a landmark building.The mosque’s design leans on thick rammed earth walls, passive cooling, solar panels, low-carbon concrete, and energy-efficient LED lighting to serve over 1,300 visitors across 1,595 sqm.Avance LabsandBureau Veritasindependently stamped the steel with global sustainability certifications, making sure it ticks all the right boxes.This effort revs up the UAE’sindustrial decarbonizationplaybook, eyeing a 40% emissions drop by 2030 on the road to net-zero by 2050.Green Hydrogen and Steel: A Closer LookAt the core of this milestone isgreen hydrogen-fueled steelmaking. In that October 2024 pilot,Masdar’s renewable-powered electrolyzers whipped up hydrogen that replaced natural gas and coal for direct iron ore reduction. Thanks to thishydrogen productionroute, sponge iron emerges with nothing but water vapor as a byproduct, slashing carbon emissions by about 95% over standard blast furnace methods. That same process cranked out 5,000 tonnes of green steel for the mosque, all independently verified byAvance LabsandBureau Veritasagainst international low-emission benchmarks.What’s more, the whole setup taps into Masdar City’s solar and wind microgrid, ensuring the electrolytic hydrogen—and ultimately the rebar—carries almost zero embedded carbon. After the reduction stage, the sponge iron gets melted, alloyed, and transformed into rebar under tight quality controls. Over at EMSTEEL’s Fujairah plant, the bars are rolled, cooled, and prepped for delivery, showing how top-notchzero-emission technologycan slide right into conventional supply lines without skimping on strength or breaking the bank.EMSTEEL isn’t stopping here. Their roadmap calls for cranking up green steel output to 100,000 tonnes a year by 2030, setting the stage for a fully net-zero production line by 2050. Hitting those targets means adding more electrolyzers, signing up fresh renewable power deals, and fine-tuning every step of the process. Early numbers hint that, once you scale up,green hydrogencould dip below $1.50/kg, making the whole approach not just eco-friendly but also commercially sustainable—ready to roll out beyond headline projects like this mosque.Designing the Net-Zero MosqueThe mosque’s look is all about blending time-honored Islamic architecture with next-gen sustainability. Those heftyrammed earthwalls, crafted from local soil, give the space thermal mass that keeps indoor temps steady in Abu Dhabi’s heat. Combined with passive cooling vents and courtyards strategically placed for natural airflow, they slash HVAC energy use by over 35%. Up top, solar panels generate a hefty chunk of the mosque’s power needs, running LED lights, efficient water pumps, and even the ablution stations.Spanning 1,595 sqm and built for more than 1,300 worshippers, the design also calls for low-carbon concrete mixes and ethically sourced carpets. Every fixture and finish gets scrutinized for low embodied emissions, while the hydrogen-based rebar ties it all together to meet the strictestLEED Zero Carbonstandards. The result? A public building that’s both spiritually uplifting and a showcase for next-levelsustainable energydesign.Strategic Partnership and Market ImplicationsEMSTEEL,Aldar Properties, andMasdarhave stitched together a partnership that fast-tracks low-carbon materials at scale. For EMSTEEL, the mosque is a live demo of their green steel credentials, amping up investor confidence as they eye future listings. Aldar, already a trailblazer for hydrogen-based steel, cements its green-building reputation and optimizes its supply chain. Masdar, with its mix of solar farms and wind assets, anchors the entire setup, proving how an integrated renewable energy portfolio can power heavy industry.On top of that, the project highlights why smart policy matters. The UAE’s Net Zero by 2050 strategy, alongside incentives for green construction, has created fertile ground for innovation. As carbon disclosure becomes a must for big developments, early movers like this trio can tap into green finance at attractive rates, tipping the scales in favor of sustainable materials.Regional Impact and Future StepsThis net-zero mosque isn’t just a standalone win; it’s a springboard for regionalindustrial decarbonization. By showing there’s a clear playbook for both making and using green steel, it takes the fear out of the unknown for other players thinking aboutgreen hydrogenand zero-emission building materials. Workshops are already on the calendar for late 2025, where engineers, architects, and procurement teams from across the GCC can learn the ropes. Plans are also afoot to boost electrolyzer capacity past 50 MW, fueled by green bonds and public-private funding.Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and other neighbors are watching closely. If this mosque checks all the boxes, it could spur new regional standards for low-emission building codes and even shape carbon credit markets linked to sustainable materials. Lenders and investors are tracking the project’s numbers, ready to back the next wave ofzero-emission technologyventures.OutlookWe’re at a real crossroads wheregreen hydrogenmeets centuries-old craftsmanship. This mosque proves you don’t have to choose between heritage and climate action. As the UAE marches toward its 2050 net-zero goals, projects like this will set the pace for mainstreaming hydrogen-based steel and other clean materials. And if costs keep sliding and regulations stay supportive, we could soon seezero-emission technologypopping up in construction projects all around the Middle East—and beyond.Spread the love Key InsightsThis project is the first big-scale application ofgreen hydrogenin steelmaking across the region, chopping CO₂ emissions by up to 95% compared to traditional blast furnaces.Back in October 2024,EMSTEELandMasdarran a pilot that churned out 5,000 tonnes of certified green steel, proving the concept works at scale.Aldar Propertiesearns bragging rights as the region’s first developer to use hydrogen-based steel in a landmark building.The mosque’s design leans on thick rammed earth walls, passive cooling, solar panels, low-carbon concrete, and energy-efficient LED lighting to serve over 1,300 visitors across 1,595 sqm.Avance LabsandBureau Veritasindependently stamped the steel with global sustainability certifications, making sure it ticks all the right boxes.This effort revs up the UAE’sindustrial decarbonizationplaybook, eyeing a 40% emissions drop by 2030 on the road to net-zero by 2050.Green Hydrogen and Steel: A Closer LookAt the core of this milestone isgreen hydrogen-fueled steelmaking.

Those heftyrammed earthwalls, crafted from local soil, give the space thermal mass that keeps indoor temps steady in Abu Dhabi’s heat. Combined with passive cooling vents and courtyards strategically placed for natural airflow, they slash HVAC energy use by over 35%. Up top, solar panels generate a hefty chunk of the mosque’s power needs, running LED lights, efficient water pumps, and even the ablution stations.Spanning 1,595 sqm and built for more than 1,300 worshippers, the design also calls for low-carbon concrete mixes and ethically sourced carpets.

    "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Pure Hydrogen Corporation Limited— a publicly listed innovator inhydrogen productionandfuel cell technology— has hit the pause button on trades at the Australian Securities Exchange. This halt, which will last until they unveil a majorcapital raising, highlights just how deep the pockets need to be to scale upclean hydrogenventures. Around the world, investments in hydrogen are booming as governments and industry race toward zero-emission solutions for heavy transport and big industrial players. For a country gearing up to be a top exporter of green hydrogen, Pure Hydrogen’s decision is a pivotal moment in Australia’s energy transition.A Strategic PauseTrading halts aren’t exactly headline-grabbing news, but they’re par for the course when firms are about to drop material updates. In Pure Hydrogen’s case, this freeze buys time to lock in a non-renounceable placement—think of it as an invite-only share offer for institutional and sophisticated investors. That’s great for execution speed and regulatory peace of mind, but it usually means dilution for existing holders. Beyond the usual compliance box-checking, this pause signals a serious upcoming capital call to fund everything from electrolysis plants to compression units and refuelling hubs.Funding the Hydrogen PushWhy the big ask? Because making hydrogen work for heavy transport is no small feat. Electrolysers, which use electricity to split water into hydrogen, can gobble up 40–50% of your project budget right off the bat. Layer on the costs of rolling out a nationwide network of hydrogen refuelling stations and certifying fuel cell trucks, and you’ve got a capital-intensive game. Industry vets say that economies of scale and module standardization will tame those costs—if you can secure hefty equity or project financing. This capital raise aims to supercharge Pure Hydrogen’s R&D, ramp up production of its signature prime movers, and speed up the build-out of essentialhydrogen infrastructureto improve unit economics.Pure Hydrogen’s FootprintSince its ASX debut in 2021,Pure Hydrogenhas been methodically piecing together an end-to-end hydrogen ecosystem. They’ve teamed up with logistics heavyweight TOLL Group to trial hydrogen-powered prime movers, deployed mobile refuellers for regional government fleets, and kicked off feasibility studies for solar-driven hydrogen hubs in Victoria and South Australia. By owning the entire chain—from onsite electrolysis and compression through to storage and distribution—they’re banking on vertical integration to keep costs in check and quality consistent. A recent framework deal with a renewable energy developer further underscores their strategy for locking in both feedstock and long-term offtake.Australia’s Clean Energy DriveAustralia’s pledge to hit net-zero by 2050 puts hydrogen front and centre in its clean energy plans. The country’s abundant solar and wind resources make grid-powered electrolysis an obvious play, and states like Queensland and New South Wales have already laid down multimillion-dollarhydrogen infrastructureroadmaps. Federal grants and guaranteed off-take schemes have kickstarted dozens of pilot plants, but moving from small-scale demos to gigawatt-class electrolysers and export terminals means one thing: private capital. Pure Hydrogen’s upcoming placement could bridge that funding gap and help position Australia as the go-to green hydrogen exporter for Asia-Pacific markets.Market and Investor ImpactA trading halt means shareholders can’t trade, and that lack of liquidity often brings jitters and short-term swings. Once Pure Hydrogen pulls back the curtain on placement details, analysts will tear into pricing, dilution levels and any anchor investors in the mix. A well-supported raise could reignite buying momentum, but if the offer comes at a steep discount, expect downward pressure on the share price. Meanwhile, early backers who get in now might lock down strategic partnerships and construction slots ahead of competitors chasing the same grants and grid connections.Implications for StakeholdersThe ripple effects of this capital call stretch far beyond just investors. Equipment manufacturers—think electrolysers, high-pressure storage tanks and compressors—stand to see order books fill up if those large-scale projects get green-lit. Construction contractors could see a steady pipeline of work for plant builds, while logistics operators planning hydrogen fleet rollouts will finally get a clearer timetable for station availability. Regional communities pitched for new green hydrogen hubs might see fresh jobs and infrastructure upgrades. At the end of the day, this raise could unlock economic activity across the entirehydrogen energy market.Technical Snapshot: Fuel Cell VehiclesHydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity through an electrochemical reaction, with pure water vapor as the only byproduct. The real draw? Refuelling takes minutes—comparable to diesel—and the range is hefty, making FCVs a strong fit for heavy-duty workhorses like prime movers. But costs are steep thanks to platinum catalysts, rugged high-pressure tanks and specialized power electronics. Getting production volumes up and securing government incentives will be crucial to push down per-unit prices and accelerate fleet adoption ofhydrogen fuel cells.Parallel Moves in the SectorPure Hydrogen’s trading halt is just one act in a bigger play. Across the ASX, other clean energy players—from biogas developers to battery storage outfits—have pressed pause on trading to shore up funding. It’s a reminder that government pledges alone won’t flip the switch on emerging tech at scale. The real missing piece? Private investment. If Pure Hydrogen nails its placement, it could spark a domino effect of capital raises as rivals and partners hustle to lock in their hydrogen ambitions.Next Steps and OutlookInvestors are on standby for the ASX announcement, expected in the coming days. The market will be watching the total size of the placement, any discount to market price, and which big-name backers are stepping up. A solid institutional line-up could turbocharge Pure Hydrogen’s push into full-scale refuelling networks and fuel cell fleet deployments across Australia. If the raise falls short, they might have to explore joint ventures with energy majors or lean on project finance structures to keep momentum going.In the race to build outhydrogen infrastructure, cash is the real differentiator between pilots and commercial rollouts. Pure Hydrogen’s trading halt isn’t just a box-ticking exercise—it’s a defining chapter in Australia’s quest to dominate the globalhydrogen energy market. The outcome will reveal who’s got the financial firepower to turn the promise of hydrogen into a green reality for heavy transport and industry.Spread the love A Strategic PauseTrading halts aren’t exactly headline-grabbing news, but they’re par for the course when firms are about to drop material updates.

Equipment manufacturers—think electrolysers, high-pressure storage tanks and compressors—stand to see order books fill up if those large-scale projects get green-lit. Construction contractors could see a steady pipeline of work for plant builds, while logistics operators planning hydrogen fleet rollouts will finally get a clearer timetable for station availability. Regional communities pitched for new green hydrogen hubs might see fresh jobs and infrastructure upgrades. At the end of the day, this raise could unlock economic activity across the entirehydrogen energy market.Technical Snapshot: Fuel Cell VehiclesHydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity through an electrochemical reaction, with pure water vapor as the only byproduct. The real draw? Refuelling takes minutes—comparable to diesel—and the range is hefty, making FCVs a strong fit for heavy-duty workhorses like prime movers. But costs are steep thanks to platinum catalysts, rugged high-pressure tanks and specialized power electronics. Getting production volumes up and securing government incentives will be crucial to push down per-unit prices and accelerate fleet adoption ofhydrogen fuel cells.Parallel Moves in the SectorPure Hydrogen’s trading halt is just one act in a bigger play. Across the ASX, other clean energy players—from biogas developers to battery storage outfits—have pressed pause on trading to shore up funding. It’s a reminder that government pledges alone won’t flip the switch on emerging tech at scale. The real missing piece? Private investment. If Pure Hydrogen nails its placement, it could spark a domino effect of capital raises as rivals and partners hustle to lock in their hydrogen ambitions.Next Steps and OutlookInvestors are on standby for the ASX announcement, expected in the coming days. The market will be watching the total size of the placement, any discount to market price, and which big-name backers are stepping up. A solid institutional line-up could turbocharge Pure Hydrogen’s push into full-scale refuelling networks and fuel cell fleet deployments across Australia. If the raise falls short, they might have to explore joint ventures with energy majors or lean on project finance structures to keep momentum going.In the race to build outhydrogen infrastructure, cash is the real differentiator between pilots and commercial rollouts. Pure Hydrogen’s trading halt isn’t just a box-ticking exercise—it’s a defining chapter in Australia’s quest to dominate the globalhydrogen energy market. The outcome will reveal who’s got the financial firepower to turn the promise of hydrogen into a green reality for heavy transport and industry.Spread the love Why the big ask? Because making hydrogen work for heavy transport is no small feat. Electrolysers, which use electricity to split water into hydrogen, can gobble up 40–50% of your project budget right off the bat. Layer on the costs of rolling out a nationwide network of hydrogen refuelling stations and certifying fuel cell trucks, and you’ve got a capital-intensive game. Industry vets say that economies of scale and module standardization will tame those costs—if you can secure hefty equity or project financing. This capital raise aims to supercharge Pure Hydrogen’s R&D, ramp up production of its signature prime movers, and speed up the build-out of essentialhydrogen infrastructureto improve unit economics.Pure Hydrogen’s FootprintSince its ASX debut in 2021,Pure Hydrogenhas been methodically piecing together an end-to-end hydrogen ecosystem. They’ve teamed up with logistics heavyweight TOLL Group to trial hydrogen-powered prime movers, deployed mobile refuellers for regional government fleets, and kicked off feasibility studies for solar-driven hydrogen hubs in Victoria and South Australia. By owning the entire chain—from onsite electrolysis and compression through to storage and distribution—they’re banking on vertical integration to keep costs in check and quality consistent. A recent framework deal with a renewable energy developer further underscores their strategy for locking in both feedstock and long-term offtake.Australia’s Clean Energy DriveAustralia’s pledge to hit net-zero by 2050 puts hydrogen front and centre in its clean energy plans. The country’s abundant solar and wind resources make grid-powered electrolysis an obvious play, and states like Queensland and New South Wales have already laid down multimillion-dollarhydrogen infrastructureroadmaps. Federal grants and guaranteed off-take schemes have kickstarted dozens of pilot plants, but moving from small-scale demos to gigawatt-class electrolysers and export terminals means one thing: private capital. Pure Hydrogen’s upcoming placement could bridge that funding gap and help position Australia as the go-to green hydrogen exporter for Asia-Pacific markets.Market and Investor ImpactA trading halt means shareholders can’t trade, and that lack of liquidity often brings jitters and short-term swings. Once Pure Hydrogen pulls back the curtain on placement details, analysts will tear into pricing, dilution levels and any anchor investors in the mix.

    "full_text": "Hydrogen Fuel NewsHydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hydrogen News – Green Hydrogen Report Hyundai Motor Groupis doubling down on its drive to reshape theHyundai hydrogen ecosystem. WithKen Ramirez—the new Executive Vice President and head of the Energy and Hydrogen Business Division—leading the charge, they’re taking things way beyond just fuel cell cars and trucks. Get this: under Ramirez, who arrived from Renault-Nissan, Hyundai isn’t just selling vehicles anymore. They’ve built an all-in-one hydrogen universe—production, storage, transport, distribution, you name it—under theirHTWO platform. They even showed off this fully integrated model at both ACT Expo in California and the World Hydrogen Summit 2025. In a nutshell, Hyundai’s gone from automaker to orchestrator of a full-blown hydrogen economy, weaving together R&D, capital, and partners into a scalable, global play.Historical Context: A Legacy of InnovationSince its founding in 1967,Hyundai Motor Groupbuilt its name on mass-market cars and heavy machinery. Fast forward to the early 2000s, when curious R&D crews dipped their toes into hydrogen. That early work led to passengerfuel cell vehicleslike the NEXO, which quickly set high bars for reliability, and the commercialXCIENTheavy-duty truck. Pilot projects even tested high-pressure refueling, paving the way for government-backed hydrogen incentives—especially in South Korea. Those first steps of making and moving hydrogen laid the groundwork for today’s fully integratedhydrogen value chain, where manufacturing, engineering, and supply logistics all tie together.How Hydrogen Fuel Cells Work: Clean Power on DemandAt the core of this real-world breakthrough is the humble hydrogen fuel cell—a neat little gadget that turns hydrogen and oxygen into electricity, with only water and heat as byproducts. Here’s the skinny: hydrogen molecules split at the anode, freeing up protons and electrons. The protons slip through a membrane while the electrons do the heavy lifting—powering motors or generators—before they all reunite with oxygen at the cathode. What you get is on-demand, zero-emission power. From passenger cars to heavy trucks, marine vessels to remote generators, fuel cells can balance grids, back up critical infrastructure, and kick CO₂ and particulates to the curb.HTWO: Secret Sauce for a Seamless EcosystemTheHTWO platformis Hyundai’s open-door blueprint for hydrogen success. It pulls together internal units likeHyundai E&Cwith energy majors, infrastructure specialists, and tech firms, covering everything from green hydrogen production and high-pressure storage to pipeline logistics, truck transport, and public refueling stations. They’re even exploring Waste-to-Hydrogen (W2H) tech to turn trash into fuel, slashing feedstock costs. By inviting co-investors and sharing roadmaps, HTWO aims to make hydrogen as easy to use as diesel—speeding up global market readiness for robusthydrogen infrastructure.Advanced Driver Assistance Systems: The AI EdgeHyundai’s fuel cell trucks aren’t just clean—they’re smart. Built-inADAStech—radar, LiDAR, cameras, and predictive analytics—offers everything from lane-keeping and adaptive cruise to collision alerts and telematics integration. This AI-driven toolkit cuts downtime, slashes maintenance bills, and boosts driver confidence—key for fleets comparing hydrogen to electric or diesel options.Global Footprint: South Korea, USA & IndonesiaHyundai’s rolling out hydrogen plants and refueling networks across South Korea, home to 52 million people and major industrial hubs like Ulsan and Yeouido, all thanks to government roadmaps. Over in Georgia, USA, their October 2024 facility churns out both electric and hydrogen vehicles, turning the state into a logistics and innovation hot spot. At ACT Expo in Anaheim, California, they spotlight both XCIENT heavy-duty trucks and the HTWO ecosystem in action. Meanwhile, in Indonesia, strategic partnerships are setting the stage for new hydrogen production sites and export routes—tapping into Southeast Asia’s growing thirst for clean fuels.Engineering the Future with Hyundai E&CHyundai Engineering & Constructionis the linchpin of theH-Roadinitiative, linking green hydrogen facilities to nuclear plants and eyeing small modular reactors (SMRs) for co-generation. By feeding large electrolyzers with stable, low-carbon power, they promise steady hydrogen output. Add investments in lithium for battery synergies, and you’ve got cross-division collaboration on full display. H-Road cements Hyundai E&C’s role in next-gen energy infrastructure, including pilot projects with national utilities.Collateral Impacts: Jobs, Standards & TransformationThis hydrogen push isn’t just about cleaner transport—it’s spawning new jobs in engineering, construction, maintenance, and R&D. University partnerships are sprouting catalysts and tech labs, while port authorities, tram networks, and maritime fleets get clear guidelines through evolving ISO frameworks. By swapping out fossil fuels in heavy logistics and industrial power, Hyundai is fueling a wider shift toward net-zero targets and proving that hydrogen can scale across industries.Challenges, Solutions & The Road AheadLet’s be real: scaling up hydrogen isn’t a walk in the park. Electrolyzer costs are still steep, refueling stations need to multiply, and feedstock availability can swing. Energy price swings add extra headaches, and aligning international rules is an ongoing puzzle. Hyundai’s tackling these hurdles head-on—partnering with energy giants, kicking off W2H pilots, and fine-tuning ADAS for peak efficiency. Their openHTWO platformattracts investors and tech collaborators, while the H-Road initiative taps nuclear to steady supply. These proof points and emerging standards are paving the way for wider adoption of the hydrogen value chain.Bottom line:Hyundai Motor Grouphas flipped the script on hydrogen—transforming from a mobility player into a vertically integrated, global hydrogen powerhouse. With theHTWO platformat its core, Hyundai is setting the pace for the energy transition. As demand for clean energy ramps up, their all-in-one approach may well become the blueprint for industry-wide adoption.Spread the love Historical Context: A Legacy of InnovationSince its founding in 1967,Hyundai Motor Groupbuilt its name on mass-market cars and heavy machinery.

Image: Michael Pointner, Unsplash The Canadian government is putting more than CAD 33 million toward a 32 MW Indigenous-owned solar project in the south-central province of Saskatchewan. TheWicehtowak Solar project, to be located by the province's capital, Regina, will be built byGeorge Gordon First Nation via Wicehtowak Solar Ltd. Canada’s Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources said the project serves as a pilot enabling the sale of electricity from private developers to customers in the province.A 30-year power purchase agreement, described as the first of its kind in Saskatchewan, will supply electricity to mining group K+S Potash Canada through the SaskPower grid. Canadian Secretary of State (Rural Development) Buckley Belanger said that the project will “add more clean power to the grid, create long-term jobs and help keep energy costs stable for families and businesses in Saskatchewan.” The government’s investment is part of the Smart Renewables and Electrification Pathways Program, a CAD 4.5 billion federally funded initiative launched in 2021. As of May this year, the program had supported 71 projects, 43 of them Indigenous-owned. The Wicehtowak Solar project is the latest in a series of Indigenous-led solar projects backed by the Canadian government, including a2.85 MWproject in Yukon and a3.8 MWarray in British Columbia, the country’s largest off-grid solar project to date.

    "full_text": "Brazil is expected to add 13 GW of solar capacity in 2025, according to the Brazilian Photovoltaic Solar Energy Association (Absolar), but growth appears to be slowing as curtailment, grid constraints, and regulatory uncertainty challenge new projects. Brazil is expected to add 13.2 GW of solar capacity in 2025, but the market is showing early signs of slowing as new large-scale projects face delays and distributed generation encounters connection barriers. The Brazilian solar sector, while still a global leader as the sixth largest in cumulative capacity and fourth largest in new connections in 2024, is now focusing on enabling new demand growth and transmission infrastructure to absorb new plants, as well as developing a domestic storage market. Brazil is projected to end 2025 with 67.1 GW of cumulative solar capacity, up from 53.9 GW at the end of 2024, according to projections presented by Absolar at the opening of The smarter E South America this week in São Paulo, Brazil. The event combines the Intersolar, EES, Power2Drive, and Eletrotec EMPower trade fairs. Distributed solar generation is expected to total 45.278 GW by the end of this year, while centralized generation could hit 21.880 GW, according to Absolar. The trade group’s forecast points to slower growth than 2024, when the sector added 15.7 GW. Distributed generation is expected to contribute 8.5 GW in 2025, from 10 GW installed in 2024, while centralized generation will connect 4.6 GW, down from 5.7 GW last year. “Brazil is one of the largest global markets for solar energy, attracting players from India, Turkey, and of course China,” said Rodrigo Sauaia, Absolar’s chief executive, during the event opening. He called for the country to establish policies to maintain its global leadership. “This year is special with COP 30 held in Belém (PA) and the expectation that countries update their emission reduction targets. Brazil currently claims to be a renewable leader, but if no action is taken, it risks being overtaken by nations that have already set targets to be 100% renewable.” Sauaia noted ongoing efforts to remove subsidies and discounts for solar power while fossil fuels continue to receive support. He cited a 2023 Inesc study showing that fossil fuels receive 4.5 times more government benefits than renewables through reductions, exemptions, and programs. “While new renewable energy concessions no longer get TUSD [Tarifa de Uso do Sistema de Distribuição] and TUST [Tarifa de Uso do Sistema de Transmissão] discounts, fossil sources continue to receive support. We have already paved the way for reducing incentives that other sources lack,” he said. Several provisional measures (MPs) are moving through the Brazilian National Congress, which could either advance or hinder the sector: MP 1.300 addresses liberalization of the free market and tariff changes, including adjustments to discounts for centralized plants already in operation. MP 1.304 modifies provisions related to the Energy Development Account, requiring agents receiving incentives to contribute payments. MP 1.307 mandates that industries in Export Processing Zones (ZPEs) be supplied solely by renewables, though there is pressure to include nuclear and thermal sources. Although these MPs pose challenges, they may also create opportunities for key issues, such as national storage regulation, said Sauaia. Generation curtailments remain a major challenge for Brazil’s renewable sector. In 2025, an estimated 15% to 20% of solar and wind generation will be curtailed, with only 5% compensated. This leaves financial liabilities for developers, causing losses and delaying new investments. Solar generators alone are projected to face losses of BRL 1.7 billion ($313.3 million). Battery storage is emerging as a strategic solution. Its deployment in the Brazilian Electrical System (SEB) is expected to be based on technical merits such as flexibility, modularity, and ancillary services rather than subsidies. Studies by ABSAE and Aurora show batteries are competitive for capacity reserve services, with some commercial applications achieving payback in as little as five years. Brazil currently has about 800 MWh of installed battery capacity, half in rural electrification systems. Growth is expected in both off-grid systems and grid-connected projects serving the power system, residential, and commercial consumers. ABSAE recommends contracting at least 2 GWh in future auctions, but the absence of clear regulatory guidance limits expansion. “We do not yet have a framework for generators to invest in storage,” said Markus Vlasits, the association’s president. Regulatory debates involve revenue stacking, classification of service providers as consumers, and risks of double charges under TUST. A regulatory framework is expected to provide certainty for the first storage auction. In the Amazon region, integrating solar with batteries is seen as critical for reducing emissions from isolated systems and ensuring social inclusion in remote communities. Brazil’s energy transition extends beyond generation. Electric mobility is a strategic focus, encompassing infrastructure, installation quality, and network connection. “Efficient electrical installations are essential to use every watt generated,” said João Gilberto Cunha of Eletrotec Mpower. The transition depends on well-prepared, intelligent grids. Ronaldo Koloszuk of Absolar noted that although 2025 is a difficult year for solar with combined solar and wind losses of $5 billion, major challenges are being addressed, and in the medium to long term, the sector will benefit from batteries and e-mobility.

    "full_text": "Scientists in India have designed a system that uses PV panels, a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell, battery storage, and a supercapacitor. It also relies on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-based MPPT that reportedly achieves an efficiency of 98.7%. Image: Godavari Global University A research team led by scientists from India has developed a novel “smart” electric vehicle (EV) system that uses PV panels, a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell, battery storage, and a supercapacitor. At the core of the system lies a Z-source integrated boost converter with an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm. “Unlike conventional PV-only or hybrid systems, this approach combines intelligent control with multi-source energy management to ensure efficient, stable, and reliable power delivery for smart EV charging applications,” corresponding author Suresh Vendoti toldpv magazine. “In our future work, we will expand the concept to renewable-energy-based DC microgrids with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capability, enabling smarter integration of EVs into the energy ecosystem.” The system was simulated using MATLAB/Simulink 2021a. It included two 50 kW fast-charging units, a PV system with peak power of 186 kW, a lead-acid battery (BAT), and a hydrogen-based energy storage system (ESS). The hydrogen ESS includes a 176 kVA hydrogen production system, six 66 kW fuel cell (FC) modules, and a 450 kg hydrogen tank. The system is integrated using Z-source converters (ZSCs), where an impedance network connects the PV system, BAT, and the grid. The design of the ZSC includes two synchronously controlled switches, an input diode, an output diode, and a capacitor, and operates either in continuous conduction mode (CCM) or discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). “An ANFIS-based MPPT method is proposed to optimize solar panel output under varying weather conditions. It uses PV voltage, current, and temperature as input variables, with the duty cycle as the output to control a DC-DC switched boost Landsman converter for maximum power tracking,” explained the academics. “With sufficient training epochs, ANFIS optimizes MPPT performance by refining fuzzy rules and minimizing errors, making it ready for real-time control applications.” That system was verified with a lab-scale prototype, using FC with an output voltage of 100 V and an output current of 30-40 A; a DC-DC convertor with an output voltage of 1,000-1,100 V and an output current of 30 A; and a battery with 120 V of voltage. The error between the simulation and the prototype ranged between 0.8% and 3%, depending on the parameter. “Simulation results demonstrate effective voltage boosting from 110 V to 150 V and a regulated output of approximately 1100 V at 30 A, with the PV-side current stabilized at 500 A. The fuel cell maintains a steady output of 110 V while its current decreases from 40 A to 25 A, and the battery retains a 60% state-of-charge (SOC) at 120 V output,” the results showed. “The hardware prototype, developed using a DSPIC30F4011 microcontroller, achieves an MPPT efficiency of 98.7%, voltage regulation within ± 1.5%, and output power deviation under 2%. Grid voltage and current waveforms exhibit low total harmonic distortion (THD), in compliance with IEEE 519 standards, with measured values of 500 V and 13 A, respectively.” Concluding, Vendoti said that “the most striking result was the significant improvement in tracking efficiency and dynamic performance of the ANFIS-based MPPT under fluctuating solar irradiance compared to conventional MPPT algorithms. Additionally, the hybrid configuration proved capable of maintaining grid stability and uninterrupted EV charging, even under variable renewable generation and load demand, which exceeded initial expectations.” The details of the system can be found in “Grid tied hybrid PV fuel cell system with energy storage and ANFIS based MPPT for smart EV charging,”published inScientific Reports.Researchers from India’s Godavari Global University, St. Ann’s College of Engineering and Technology,GMR Institute of Technology, New Horizon College of Engineering, MLR Institute of Technology, Thailand’s Shinawatra University, Saudi Arabia’sTaif University,and Ethiopia’s Wollo University have participated in the study.

    "full_text": "A Chinese research team at Tarim University have developed a lightweight object detection and pose recognition solution for solar panel cleaning robots. A similarly installed fixed tilt PV system was used for model training Image: SayCheeeeeese, Wikimedia Commons, CC0 1.0 Universal Scientists at Tarim University of China have proposed a way to address the challenging problem of pose recognition for photovoltaic panelcleaning robots. Their novel solution is based on a low power version of the You Only Look Once (YOLOv8) model for object detection and computer vision tasks. Other versions of YOLO have been investigated for solar applications, such as defect detection and panel inspection. The effective use of PV cleaning robots requires precise object detection and pose recognition but also low-power consumption, according to the researchers. In this regard, there are machine vision challenges to be addressed: panels have diverse tilt angles and orientations, there is imaging interference from ambient light, dust, and dirt, as well as partial occlusion caused by other panels The team proposed a lightweight panel pose recognition model based on You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 8 nano (YOLOv8n) object detection algorithm. It said that this version represents the “most lightweight variant” within the YOLOv8 machine vision and object detection family as it prioritizes efficiency and real-time processing to enable the use of low-power hardware. The work is detailed in “YOLOv8n‑PP: a lightweight pose recognition algorithm for photovoltaic array cleaning robot,” published inJournal of Real-Time Image Processing. The researchers used a “diverse and comprehensive dataset” for photovoltaic panel poses to ensure that their method demonstrates “strong generalization performance” for a variety of environments. The dataset, named P-Pose, consisted of PV pose images collected from the photovoltaic power plant of Jingke Technology in Alar City, China. They integrated YOLOv8n with Mobile-ViT machine vision technology to create YOLOv8n-Photovoltaic-Pose (YOLOv8n-PP). The scientists said that Mobile-ViT is a lighter version of self-attention-based vision transformer (ViT) for mobile applications. ViT was reportedly developed as an alternative to a transformer based on convolutional neural networks to achieve a faster inference speed. “This integration helps mitigate the eﬀects of varying target poses from the robot’s mobile perspective,” said the researchers. Additionally, they used a bounding box regression to enhance the precision and accuracy of PV panel recognition, known as MPDIoU loss. “Combining YOLOv8n, Mobile-ViT, and MPDIoU loss, we propose a method called YOLOv8n-Photovoltaic-Pose (YOLOv8n-PP), which leverages the strengths of these components to achieve accurate and efficient pose recognition for photovoltaic cleaning applications,” they said. For the training validation they used a 64-bit Windows 10 computer with an Intel Xeon(R) Silver 4210R CPU, and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060Ti GPU. Python 3.8 was the programming language, along with PyTorch 2.0.0 deep learning framework for network training. The team conducted a detailed analysis comparing its YOLOv8-PP method to several other versions of the YOLO, finding that its proposed solution achieved “the best results” across various evaluation metrics. “Notably, the precision and recall of our approach are 3.45% and 5.78% higher, respectively, compared to the baseline YOLOv8n model,” it said. The method showed improvements in both precision and recall, providing an “eﬀective solution for PV pose recognition” with YOLOv8n-PP not only improving detection accuracy but also enhancing stability. Room for improvement was noted in its ability to deal with extreme occlusion and highly reflective environments. Future research entails deploying YOLOv8-PP in a PV cleaning robot, field testing, and incorporating additional types of sensors, such as infrared imaging, to further improve the model’s detection performance.

    "full_text": "In its inaugural study of the emerging manufacturing hub in the Middle East and Africa, the quality assurance and technical compliance company has mapped 3.4 GW of module, 2.5 GW of solar cell, and 8.05 GW of ingot nameplate capacity across 27 sites. Hong Kong-based technical compliance and quality assurance companySinovoltaicshas released its firstSolar Supply Chain Map for the Middle East and Africa. It tracks nameplate capacity of 3.4 GW for modules, 2.5 GW for solar cells, and 8.05 GW of ingots. “Ambitious growth targets have been announced for 2030,” said the analysts. Over the next five years, the Middle East and Africa could see up to 62.12 GW of module manufacturing, 52.55 GW of solar cell capacity, 45 GW of polysilicon, and 290 tons of metallurgical-grade silicon. The report lists 27 factory sites and includes information about location, size, owner, and planned capacity. It is based primarily on public announcements. The analysts highlighted the accelerating effort to build full vertical integration in solar PV manufacturing early on, from polysilicon production to module assembly. “This manufacturing expansion is designed to close supply gaps in regional markets and North America, where limited upstream solar component production and low tariffs create strong demand,” said Dricus de Rooij, CEO and co-founder of Sinovoltaics in a statement, adding that some of the challenges, such as “grid infrastructure limitations and logistical bottlenecks” are still to be overcome on the way to growth. The analysts noted that the manufacturing developments were spurred by government support and local content requirements, adding that there is potential to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers. They also see potential for export, stating that the “regions are strategically positioned to serve European markets and could also export to North America,” depending on U.S. trade policies. “Although much of the announced capacity is backed by Chinese companies, the Middle East and Africa are steadily establishing themselves as alternative suppliers to Southeast Asia, which has long dominated solar exports,” they said. The report is available as a free download. The solar supply chain series includes manufacturing hubs inEurope, India,Southeast Asia, and North America. There is also anannual transformer manufacturing reportabout capacity in Mainland China. Founded in 2009, Sinovoltaics is a technical compliance and quality assurance service firm covering the battery energy storage (BESS) and solar photovoltaic industries. It has factory inspection and audit teams in key manufacturing bases, and offices in Europe, U.S. Vietnam, and China. This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

    "full_text": "Ecuador’s Ministry of Environment and Energy has authorized private companies to develop 643 MW of renewable energy projects across the country. Image: Ministerio de Ambiente y Energía de Ecuador The Ecuadorian government, through the Ministry of Environment and Energy, is authorizing 643 MW of private-sector projects to join the National Electricity System. The initiative covers self-generation and distributed generation projects using renewable sources. Minister Inés María Manzano presented enabling certificates to the companies responsible, granting them exclusive rights to develop feasibility studies, build, and operate the projects. The projects include PV arrays and hydroelectric plants and have an 18-month period to complete procedures and receive the corresponding enabling title. Of the total authorized capacity, 179.1 MW comes from distributed generation projects that will supply the electricity market under regulated contracts. The remaining 464.6 MW are self-generation projects aimed at supplying companies’ own electricity needs, with the option to sell surplus power. Unofficial estimates put the installed capacity of distributed photovoltaic systems nationwide at roughly 100 MW, with growing participation from residential, commercial, and industrial users. Current regulations facilitate grid connections and allow the injection of surplus energy, encouraging private investment in solar energy. In 2024, Ecuador faced a severe energy crisis with officially decreed nightly blackouts to reduce consumption. In response, the National Assembly approved in October 2024 the Organic Law to Promote Private Initiative in Energy Generation, aimed at stimulating renewable energy deployment and private investment in the sector.

    "full_text": "Huaneng has commissioned a 5 MW perovskite PV demonstration plant in China’s Qinghai province to test performance, durability, and environmental adaptability under high-altitude, high-UV conditions. China Huaneng’s Clean Energy Technology Research Institute and China Huaneng Group’s Qinghai unit have commissioned what they describe as the world’s first commercial-scale 5 MW perovskite PV demonstration and verification plant at the Gonghe photovoltaic park in Qinghai province. The facility, formally brought online on Aug. 23, 2025, aims to generate empirical data on power performance, long-term reliability, and environmental adaptability of perovskite and tandem perovskite/silicon modules under extreme plateau conditions. The system integrates large-area perovskite modules from domestic manufacturers, targeting more than 90% domestic content for core equipment. Test protocols follow the TÜV SÜD-enhanced IEC 61215 sequence (DH2000/TC400) adopted by UtmoLight Technology: 2,000 hours of damp-heat exposure, 400 thermal cycles, and post-test power degradation below 5%. The program will simulate five years’ cumulative high-altitude ultraviolet irradiation (104 kWh/m²) and assess combined light-and-heat aging at 1.2× standard irradiance (1,200 W/m²) and 60 C. Huaneng’s laboratory-scale perovskite/silicon tandem cells will also join the program. According to Huaneng, the modules have exceeded 33% conversion efficiency, with laser scribing edge-loss below 0.1 mm and encapsulants with water-vapor transmission rates under 10⁻⁶ g/m²/day, supported by pilot production and demonstration lines bridging lab and commercial workstreams. Key participants includeGCL Optoelectronic Material,Microquanta,UtmoLight TechnologyandRenshine Solar. The Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, is contributing materials-science support, particularly in precursor purity and defect-density control. Huaneng estimates current perovskite module mass-production costs at CNY 0.8 ($0.11)/W and a highland levelized cost of electricity near CNY 0.15/kWh. It aims to lift module efficiencies above 22% and reduce mass-production costs below CNY 0.6/W by 2026 to approach parity with crystalline silicon. The company frames the site as both a technical milestone and a standards platform. It is leading efforts to develop perovskite module environmental-adaptation test standards, proposing the inclusion of UV, sand abrasion, and high-altitude pressure factors, and is trialing a “demonstration base plus data-service” model offering monitored module performance for a subscription fee. Project backers say the site will accelerate domestic supply-chain localization and inform applications spanning building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), floating, and mobile photovoltaics. While the demonstration marks a step toward commercialization, Huaneng said long-term data and further scale-up will be necessary to validate durability and cost trajectories before perovskite modules can be widely deployed beyond demonstration projects.

    "full_text": "Spain’s rooftop PV installations rose 11% in the second quarter after falling 17% in the first three months of the year, but overall rates remain below 2024 levels, according to Unión Española Fotovoltaica (UNEF). Spanish PV association UNEF has released preliminary data on rooftop PV installations in the second quarter of 2025. Installations fell 9% compared with the quarterly average for 2024, a smaller decline than the 17% drop in the first quarter, though rates remain below previous years. Self-consumption systems in homes also fell 9% versus the 2024 quarterly average but rose 11% from the previous quarter. UNEF attributed the increase to heightened consumer interest following the blackout, driven by energy independence, solutions with storage and inverters supporting “island mode,” and cost savings for households investing in electrification, including electric cars and heat pumps. Commercial and industrial adoption grew 4% from the same quarter in 2024, restoring the average quarterly installation rate in this segment, while also reducing reliance on future ETS 2 emission allowances, which take effect in 2027. By contrast, commercial rooftop installations declined 22% compared with the average quarter of 2024, highlighting the need for regulatory updates to support growth. Javier Revuelta of AFRY Management Consulting said self-consumption is likely to stay robust despite declining solar prices and described the coming period as favorable, with growth supported by the approaching increase in electric vehicle and heat pump adoption. However, despite signs of new capacity in the second quarter, José Donoso, UNEF’s general director, said the sector continues to face slow deployment due to administrative barriers and a lack of incentives, which limit consumer benefits, slow national decarbonization, and reduce installation volumes necessary for industry survival. UNEF said it is urgent to resolve administrative obstacles and implement incentives to advance self-consumption and meet the National Energy and Climate Plan target of 19,000 MW by 2030, noting that only 8,200 MW had been installed by the end of 2024. The association identified key measures from the unpassed “anti-blackout” Royal Decree-Law as most urgent, including creating a self-consumption manager, allowing multiple self-consumption schemes, and extending the distance for self-consumption to 5 km. UNEF also requested that the Royal Decree on self-consumption, under review by MITECO, adopt long-standing proposals such as simplified processing for facilities up to 500 kW, updating the permit exemption for facilities injecting less than 15 kW into the grid, and enabling sharing of surplus energy, not just collective generation.

    "full_text": "The Chinese company said its new PV-driven water heaters are combinable with grid electricity to ensure continuous domestic hot water supply. The new products rely on MPPT controllers and a digital control panel featuring programmable temperature settings and timer functions. Chinese heating specialist Micoe presented two PV-powered water heaters for residential use this week at the Intersolar South America 2025 event in São Paulo, Brazil. “Our new PV water heaters can be combined with grid electricity to ensure a continuous hot water supply,” Bob Wan, the company’s sales manager, toldpv magazine.“The systems can be DC-connected to solar panels and AC-connected to the grid. One 500 W module could be enough to power the smallest system in the series. The more solar panels you use, the more MPPTs are needed.” The systems use MPPT controllers and a digital control panel with programmable temperature settings and timer functions. The manufacturer claims they can reach an output temperature of up to 70 C (158 F). The products come in two versions: floor-standing and wall-mounted. The floor-standing heaters are available in three sizes, with capacities of 150 L, 200 L and 300 L. Recommended input power ranges from 10,240 to 13,650 BTU/h, with an MPPT operating voltage range of 120 V to 340 V. These systems have an AC-rated voltage of 220 V and a temperature setting range of 55 C to 80 C (131 F to 176 F). The smallest model measures 520 mm x 1,190 mm, while the largest measures 630 mm x 1,476 mm. The wall-mounted models come in two sizes, with capacities of 60 L and 80 L. Their DC input power is 1,880 BTU/h and AC-rated power is 6,820 BTU/h, with an AC-rated voltage of 220 V. They also feature a DC-rated power of 1,330 BTU/h and a DC-rated voltage of 42 V. The temperature setting range spans from 35 C to 65 C (95 F to 149 F). The smallest version measures 468 mm x 730 mm, while the largest measures 468 mm x 920 mm. Micoe is based in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, China, where it also manufactures air-source heat pumps, energy storage batteries, photovoltaic systems, kitchen appliances and water purifiers.

    "full_text": "The corporate power purchase agreement is billed as the largest signed by a UK educational institution. Agreement provides fixed-rate revenue for developer Enviromena. EDF is the utility responsible for balancing and shaping generation. Enviromena has energized its 71 MW Medebridge Solar Farm and secured a 10-year CPPA covering 80% of generation. The University of Manchester has signed a 10-year corporate PPA (CPPA) covering generation at the 71 MW Medebridge Solar Farm in Essex, England. It is thought to be the largest PPA signed by a UK educational institution to date. Developer Enviromena has energized the site and the PPA will come into effect from Sept. 1, 2025. A spokesperson for the developer toldpv magazinethe 10-year PPA covers 80% of generation on site, with the remaining 20% trading on the open market with support from EDF. EDF is also acting as the “balancing and shaping” partner in the CPPA agreement. This will see EDF take trading actions to balance the differences between forecast generation and actual output from the plant. EDF will also shape the plant’s output into an equivalent block of baseload power that will be transferred to University of Manchester’s energy supply contract. The CPPA is expected to cover 65% of the university’s electricity demand. Energy consultancy Inspired PLC advised the university during CPPA negotiations. Medebride Solar Farm was developed by Enviromena through the company’s in-house teams, and a spokesperson toldpv magazineit will continue to operate and maintain the project for its full 40-year lifespan. Based in Reading, near London, Enviromena manages, operates and maintains over 400 MW of renewable assets. The company reports a 3 GW pipeline of renewable energy projects in the United Kingdom and Italy. In a press release, Enviromena Chief Operating Officer Gary Hales said energizing Medebridge represented a “huge achievement” for the company. “Delivering a project of this scale without a single health and safety incident, and at such a pace, is testament to the expertise and dedication of our team.” Tom Abbott, PPA Director at EDF, added that the Medebridge Solar Farm CPPA shows “how smart partnerships can unlock big wins for decarbonisation.” “Our balancing, shaping, and sleeving services mean the university gets dependable clean power –and a clear path towards its net zero goals,” he said.

    "full_text": "The Australian government has officially launched two Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) tenders in Western Australia, targeting 2.4GWh of energy storage and 1.6GW of renewable energy generation. Announced today (29 August) by Australia’s climate change and energy minister Chris Bowen, the tenders, whichform part of the federal government’s CIS initiative to seek 40GW of renewables and energy storage by 2030, will specifically target projects that will connect to Western Australia’s South-West Interconnected System (SWIS), and by extension, the Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM). According to Bowen, these latest rounds will unlock an estimated AU$4 billion (US$2.62 billion) of additional private investment in the WEM. “These tenders will help deliver cleaner, more reliable and more affordable energy for Western Australian households and businesses,” Bowen said in the announcement. Both tenders will be the first to implement a streamlined single-stage bidding process, consolidating technical and financial proposals, intended toshorten the tender duration from nine months to approximately six. This approach is designed to increase efficiency and support the timely signing of Capacity Investment Scheme Agreements (CISAs). In an interview withESN Premium,Nick Hawke, director of Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), recently said this move was a positive shift for the CIS scheme. Potential proponents are advised to register before 10 October 2025 for both tenders, with bids to close on 7 November. Successful bids into Tenders 5 and 6 are expected to be announced in March 2026. You can find out more about registering via theofficial website. At the recentBattery Asset Management Summit Australia 2025, Thimo Mueller, general manager, commercial at AusEnergy Services Ltd (ASL), formerly AEMO Services, confirmed that theresults from Tender 3 of the CIS initiative will be released “in the coming weeks”. The SWIS faces unique challenges as Western Australia integrates higher levels of renewable energy, particularly rooftop solar, which has led to periods of low daytime demand and increased reliance on dispatchable resources during evening peaks. Tender 6 aims to address these challenges by procuring flexible capacity that can respond to fluctuations in supply and demand. This latest procurement follows the successful completion of Tender 2 for the WEM, whichresulted in four projects being selected for CISAs earlier this year. Those projects will collectively deliver 654MW/2,595MWh of clean dispatchable capacity across Western Australia’s main grid system, slightly exceeding the original target for that procurement round, which stood at 2,000MWh. The winning projects, the Boddington Giga Battery, Merredin Big Battery, Muchea Battery, and Waroona Renewable Energy Project, are scheduled to be operational by October 2027. Each project is 4-hours in duration. Theconsistent oversubscription of previous CIS tendersshowcases strong industry interest in the programme. The first six tenders already account for over half of the total required capacity under the scheme – equivalent to 12.3GW of generation and 6GW of dispatchable capacity. The focus on Western Australia comes amid significant growth in the country’s battery storage sector. As reported byEnergy-Storage.newsearlier this week, recent data from AEMO showed thatBESS has demonstrated the highest reliability among clean energy technologies in Australia. This reliability factor is particularly important for Western Australia’s isolated grid, which operates independently from theNational Electricity Market (NEM)that serves the eastern states. Western Australia’s grid is divided into two isolated networks. The SWIS covers the state’s southwest, including the capital, Perth, and the North West Interconnected System (NWIS), primarily serving the Pilbara mining region. The state has been progressively increasing its renewable energy capacity, creating growing demand for storage solutions to manage intermittency and provide grid stability services.

    "full_text": "Potentia Energy, a joint venture co-owned by Enel Green Power and INPEX, has secured the first environmental approval for a grid-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) under South Australia’s new Hydrogen and Renewable Energy (HRE) Act. The developer said yesterday (28 August) that its AU$400 million (US$261 million) 225MW/900MWh Emeroo BESS project, located approximately 15km northeast of Port Augusta, has received official approval for its Statement of Environmental Objectives (SEO) under the HRE Act, which came into effect on 11 July 2024. The Emeroo BESS will be co-located with the already operational275MW Bungala Solar Farmand is designed to deliver up to 4-hours of energy storage. According to Potentia Energy’s project documentation, the Emeroo BESS will feature a modular design utilising shipping container-based battery units arranged in a grid pattern. Each container will house lithium-ion battery modules, thermal management systems and state-of-the-art fire suppression technology. The facility will also include power conversion systems with inverters and transformers to efficiently manage electricity flow between the battery storage system and the grid. The BESS will connect to the grid and the National Electricity Market (NEM) via ElectraNet’s Emeroo Substation. The company submitted its License Application for the project to the South Australian government in early 2025, making it one of the first projects to test the new regulatory framework established by the HRE Act. With the SEO approval now secured in August 2025, Potentia Energy is targeting the commencement of construction in late 2026, with projected commercial operation scheduled for early 2028. South Australia’s HRE Act, which came into effect in July 2024, represents a shift in how large-scale renewable energy projects are regulated in the state. The legislation specifically targets grid-scale renewable energy and battery storage developments, streamlining approval processes while maintaining environmental safeguards. Under the new regulatory framework, all grid-scale renewable energy developments must now be considered under the HRE Act rather than previous planning legislation. Existing developments already operating were required to obtain a license by July 11, 2025. This regulatory evolution aligns with the Australian Energy Regulator’s (AER) assessment thatincreased energy storage capacity will be essentialto managing daily and seasonal variations in NEM output. South Australian energy and mining minister Tom Koutsantonis welcomed the development, highlighting the state’s leadership in renewable energy integration. “South Australia has been a leader in renewable energy, in particular through our pioneering foray into grid-scale battery storage,” Koutsantonis said. “We couldn’t have got to where we are – on track to 100% net renewable energy generation by 2027 – without good planning and world-leading legislation and policy.” The minister also emphasised that the HRE Act represents “another example of our [South Australia’s] early leadership,” designed to accommodate South Australia’s growing appeal as an investment destination for renewable energy projects while ensuring a “coordinated, orderly and equitable approach to renewable energy infrastructure.” South Australia has established itself as one of the leaders in grid-scale battery storage since hosting Australia’sfirst large-scale BESS at Hornsdale in 2017. Originally commissioned in 2017 at 100MW/129MWh, the Hornsdale Power Reserve BESS was expanded in 2020 to 150MW/193.5MWh. However, due to the uptake of variable renewable energy generation in the state, theAustralian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) predicts that South Australia could experience reliability gaps from 2026-27. Several large-scale BESS projects are set to come online in South Australia in the coming years. For instance, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners’ Summerfield Battery, a 240MW/960MWh system featuring Canadian Solar’s SolBank 3.0 battery technology,commenced construction earlier this year and is expected to be operational in 2027. Pacific Green’s Limestone Coast North Energy Park,recently acquired by Intera Energy for AU$460 million, will add 250MW/500MWh of storage capacity when operational in early 2027.

    "full_text": "French independent power producer (IPP) Neoen, whichis now fully owned by Canadian asset manager Brookfield, has switched on the second phase of its 560MW/2,240MWh Collie BESS in Western Australia. The BESS, which is located in close proximity to Synergy’s 2GWh Collie Battery Energy Storage System (CBESS), has already been discharging energy to the Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) in Western Australia, according to Sally Bogle, vice-president, APAC renewables and power at research company Rystad Energy. Shared on LinkedIn, Bogle also noted that the South West Interconnected System (SWIS), which covers much of the southwest of Western Australia, including the state capital Perth, is currently on track for over 1.6GW/6GWh of operational BESS capacity by the end of 2025, doubling to over 3GW/11GWh by the end of 2029. Stage 1 of the Collie BESS, sized at 219MW/877MWh, began operating in October 2024, less than 18 months after construction commenced. The BESS features 224 Tesla Megapack 2XL units and represents Neoen’s first major project in Western Australia. On 1 October, the BESS began delivering its contracted 197MW/4-hour grid capacity service to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). This service, known as ‘Non-Co-optimised Essential System Services’ (NCESS), is contracted for a two-year period. The BESS charges during daylight hours when solar generation is abundant and discharges during evening peak demand periods. Building on the success of Stage 1, Neoen has now completed the second stage of the Collie Battery, adding 341MW/1,363MWh through the installation of 348 Tesla Megapack 2XL units. In April 2024, Neoen secured a similar 300 MW/4-hour NCESS contract with AEMO for Stage 2. This contract will run for two years from 1 October 2025 and provide 300MW for four hours. In other news, Dom Watson, renewables development lead, future energy at state-owned company Synergy, has confirmed that its 2,000MWh CBESS in Western Australia is on track to be online “by the end of the year”. Speaking on stage at theBattery Asset Management Summit Australia 2025earlier this week, Watson noted that CBESS, which iscurrently undergoing its commissioning phase, will be delivered by the end of the year. Installation of all 640 battery packs and the invertersstarted in early October 2024and wascompleted in April 2025. Construction on the site, which is set to be one of Australia’s largest battery projects, started in March 2024. It is located at the site of the 300MW Collie Power Station, a coal-fired power plant scheduled for decommissioning in 2027. CBESS will be connected to the SWIS. At the Summit, Watson provided a deep dive into Synergy’s operations in Western Australia and how it has transitioned from relying on coal-fired power stations to renewables and energy storage. Indeed, Synergy has several large-scale BESS operational and under construction. For instance, last year, the organisation completed its 200MW/800MWh Kwinana 2 BESS.Construction started in July 2023,and the project was switched on before Christmas 2024. Kwinana 2 is situated adjacent to the first Kwinana BESS 1, a 100MW/200MWh 2-hour duration system, at the existing gas-fired Kwinana Power Station. Although the initial impression when building the large-scale battery storage projects was that the batteries would be the toughest to secure due to demand, Watson pointed out that this was not the case. “What we found ourselves was not only a huge task in delivering pretty material development projects in their own right, but we were also doing that right in the middle of some supply chain issues,” Watson noted “There were supply chain concerns for batteries, inverters and transformers. We initially thought batteries would be the bit of equipment that needed to be secured earlier. But we soon found out that the power conversion systems (PCS) were probably the critical bit of equipment that needed to be secured as quickly as we could.” As such, Watson outlined that Synergy abandoned the traditional engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) model, finding it too rigid and slow for managing supply chain risks across its large project portfolio. Instead, it adopted an “integrator model” that directly managed procurement, design, and construction as separate packages, giving it greater flexibility and control over supply chain challenges during project delivery. “We selected the integrated model, which was great as a concept for delivering these projects at pace. But we realised we weren’t structured to deliver projects like this, and we’d never done it before at Synergy. However, we knew we needed to scale quickly, and we knew we needed to keep delivering at pace with control,” Watson continued. Synergy then formed an “integrated project management team” by partnering with engineering firm GHD, which provided engineering expertise to complete detailed integration designs and develop IFC (Issued for Construction) packages. GHD also supplemented the company’s project management capabilities with additional project managers and control systems. In doing so, this partnership enabled real-time decision-making without commercial constraints, which proved essential for delivering large-scale, complex projects amid supply chain challenges.

    "full_text": "Energy-Storage.news Premium speaks with Sergio Melendez, storage sector manager at CAISO, and Ali Karimian, market optimisation director at GridBeyond, about regulating Bid Cost Recovery Payments in the California Independent System Operator market. Recently, the California Independent System Operator’s (CAISO’s) Market Monitor has identified gaming concerns for battery energy storage system (BESS) facilities in CAISO’s bid cost recovery (BCR) process. CAISOis a non-profit organisation offering three main services for California’s electric grid: grid operator, market administrator, and transmission planner. BCR is the CAISO settlements process through which eligible resources recover their bid costs. From CAISO: “Bid costs comprise start-up bid cost, minimum load bid cost, energy bid cost, transition bid cost, pump shut-down cost, pumping cost, ancillary services bid cost, and Residential Unit Commitment (RUC) availability payment.” “To calculate BCR, the commitment costs and the energy and AS bid costs are used as inputs to calculate a resource’s net difference between costs and revenues in separate pre-calculations for the integrated forward market (IFM), the RUC process, and the real-time market (RTM).” BCR was intended for traditional generation assets, such as natural gas units. The majority of payments in 2024 did go to natural gas units, but BESS was often coming in second, frequently receiving more than solar, hydro, or wind units. That same year, battery storage facilities recovered approximately US$18 million through real-time BCR, representing roughly 11% of the total BCR. As Ali Karimian, Market Optimisation Director at optimiserGridBeyondexplains, “The purpose of the BCR programme is to ensure resource owners are made whole when CAISO dispatches their assets beyond what the owners intended.” Karimian continues, “In recent years, CAISO’s Department of Market Monitoring (DMM) found cases where some asset owners manipulated their bid curves to trigger BCR payments unfairly.” It is important to note that GridBeyond is serving as an expert voice as an operator in CAISO, and says, “we have always prioritised being good grid citizens. We do not engage in market manipulation.” CAISO’s Melendez explains the DMM, saying, “The Department of Market Monitoring’s goal really is to keep an eye on the efficiency and effectiveness of our markets, including the Western energy imbalance market.” “Their job is to provide transparency and information to the market participants, regulators, the CAISO, our board, the governing body, and the challenges we might face, both in terms of market design and operationally. As the name implies, with market monitoring, of course, to monitor for potential detrimental market behaviour and communicate that to the ISO or applicable regulators like FERC.” Proving systematic gaming requires significant resources and burdens CAISO. Consequently, the market operator chose to modify the BCR calculation method to minimise potential abuse. Melendez explains, “When we started seeing storage coming online, we generally extended those (BCR) rules to storage. That initially did not create a bunch of complications because of how storage was participating back then.” “But what we found is that this approach creates some concerns. One was the strategic bidding concern that we were working on last year. The other concern is a little bit more generalised – some of the drivers that required the existence of BCR for conventional resources are not present for batteries.” In November 2024, CAISO submitted a tariff amendment, documented in the DMM’s ‘Storage Bid Cost Recovery and Default Energy Bid Enhancements ‘ report, aimed at solving the battery storage BCR gaming issue. The amendment became effective on 1 December 2024. CAISO’s amendment aims to limit battery bids for calculating BCR payments, primarily to prevent batteries from inflating unjustified BCR payments. This is regarded as an interim solution. According to the DMM’s report, stakeholders pointed out that some cases would still require BCR, but at the same time, unnecessary BCR payments will persist after the policy is enacted. In June, the DMM gave a storage BCR presentation, noting “Importantly, the current BCR rules remove the exposure to real-time prices for storage resources when buying back infeasible day-ahead schedules.” The report continues, stating that the ISO’s current solution only addresses the bid cost component, noting that negative revenues, rather than bid costs, are the primary driver of BCR. From the report, “Batteries will continue to receive BCR for revenue losses, which will continue to distort bidding incentives.” The DMM makes three primary recommendations: eliminate day-ahead BCR for BESS, eliminate most real-time BCR for BESS, and eliminate BCR associated with the Outage Management System (OMS) limitations on state of charge (SOC). For the first recommendation, DMM says it has yet to identify any instance where day-ahead BCR is appropriate and recommends that stakeholders discuss and provide such scenarios. Next, DMM recommends “redesigning the BCR rules to assume no eligibility for batteries and add eligibility only under specific situations where BCR is warranted.” The Monitor says that eliminating default real-time BCR from buying back day-ahead schedules would incentivise more accurate estimation of day-ahead bidding parameters and real-time bidding that reflects intraday opportunity costs based on real-time prices. The final recommendation aligns with other OMS MW capacity derates, which refer to reductions in the available MW capacity of a generation or transmission resource caused by an outage. CAISO and the DMM continue to monitor for gaming behaviour, trying to maintain a fair market for all participants, until everything is fully sorted. Melendez says, “Both DMM and the ISO, we are very much on top of trying to monitor for potentially detrimental market behaviour, and we have the means to be able to, if we identify activity that could entail consequences in terms of applicable regulation, refer that activity to the regulators, in this case, FERC.”",

    "full_text": "California and Texas have been “really good proving grounds” for energy storage technology, according to the CEO of developer Fullmark Energy. Chris McKissack said that while other regions of the US are increasingly of interest, California’s CAISO and Texas’s ERCOT grid and wholesale markets will most likely dominate his discussions with customers and partners at the upcomingRE+solar PV and energy storage trade show taking place in Las Vegas, Nevada, in September. “I expect to be talking to people about California and Texas. I think they really do remain the most stable profiles for energy storage. They’ve been two really good proving grounds for energy storage,” McKissack toldEnergy-Storage.newsin an interview. Fullmark Energy is a developer operating under a build, own and operate (BOO) business model. It was launched in 2018 under the name Hecate Grid and started as a joint venture between clean energy developer Hecate Energy and investor InfraRed Capital Partners. It rebranded as Fullmark earlier this year, marking what the company said was a transition from a primary focus on project development to “a fully integrated energy storage company that develops, finances, builds, owns, and operates standalone BESS projects across the US.” McKissack said that other ISO and RTO regions, such as PJM, SPP, and MISO, are becoming increasingly interesting. However, Fullmark’s initial portfolio of four projects, carried over from the Hecate Grid days, is in California. Three are now complete, and the fourth is under construction. The portfolio, Redwood, includes Desert-Carris and Ortega,two 20MW/40MWh projects that Fullmark announced as online this month, Johanna, a 20MW/80MWh system that went into operation in 2021, and San Jacinto, a 65MW/130MWh system nearing completion. Our interview coincided with news announced yesterday (27 August) that Fullmark Energy has hired cloud-based battery data analytics provider TWAICE to support the four projects in Southern California. The Johanna project is already onboarded to TWAICE’s analytics platform, which provides data, including state of charge (SoC) calculations, cell, module, string, system and power conversion system (PCS) level monitoring and equipment health. TWAICE claims the software solution offers much better system operation and performance visibility than an energy management system (EMS) provided by an energy storage system integrator or OEM alone. Analytics providers TWAICE and rivals like ACCURE or PowerUp have argued that theirtechnology allows operators to detect faults early enough to prevent failures, including thermal events that can lead to fires, and assure high levels of availability for peak events or grid signals to deliver ancillary services. “What’s different about battery storage is that it’s not just a ‘set it and forget it’ system,” Fullmark Energy’s Chris McKissack said. “I’m not saying that other systems are easy to build or easy to operate, but there’s another dimension to battery storage that doesn’t exist with other renewable assets, which is that you actually have to make a lot of day-to-day decisions in how to dispatch, how to operate and how to optimise the system.” The need for deeper visibility and greater control over an asset’s daily and lifetime operation has spurred the adoption of analytics platforms by a growing number of operators. Analytics is also impacting areas like insurance and warranties, with TWAICE, for example,partnering with insurance provider NARDAC. Fullmark’s Chris McKissack attributes California and Texas’s early lead—thepair represents about 65% of total cumulative US grid-scale battery storage deployments—to the two markets’ very different but equally compelling dynamics. “One, [California], where you’ve got really structured offtake opportunities, where you can really underwrite projects based on Resource Adequacy contracts, and I would say, more stable pricing. The other [Texas], where the initial returns were so healthy that you don’t really have to do a lot of explaining.” However, “both markets are saturating in certain ways,” and becoming more competitive, McKissack said. “Now you have to be good at what you’re doing. You can’t just show up. Differentiating by how you operate, what kind of cost you’re getting from your battery suppliers, how you’re doing your O&M, how you’re doing your offtake, how you’re bidding and dispatching in the model, starts to make a real difference between projects and portfolios.” The full interview with Chris McKissack will be published in the coming days forESN Premiumsubscribers.",

    "full_text": "Asset manager MEAG and a subsidiary of inverter specialist SMA have partnered to deploy a 130MW/354MWh BESS in Germany, their second together and one which will deploy ‘next-generation’ inverters. The 2.7-hour duration ready-to-build Hoexter battery energy storage system (BESS) project has a grid connection date of 2027, the companies said. It is their second project they’ve worked on, following the 92.5MW/231MWh Metelen project. Both are in North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous state in Germany. Hoexter was developed in-house by SMA Solar Technology AG subsidary SMA Altenso, which does renewables project development, system integration and construction. SMA Altenso will deliver a turnkey solution for Hoexter of development, construction, and maintenance, as it is doing with Metelen. Optimiser Entrix will trade the Metelen projectin Germany’s energy and ancillary service markets, an announcement that coincided with the inauguralEnergy Storage Summit Germany 2025,held in June by our publisher Solar Media in Stuttgart. That project should come online before the end of the year. “Battery energy storage systems are essential for bridging supply gaps during periods of low renewable generation and in facilitating the greater integration of renewable energy into the grid. With the projects in Hoexter and Metelen, we are laying the foundation for our battery storage platform in Europe.” said Dominik Damaschke, head of illiquid assets equity at MEAG. The Hoexter project will be among the first to use SMA’s ‘next-generation’ SMA Sunny Central Storage UP-S inverters, which incorporate silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET technology. That means outstanding energy conversion efficiency, low acoustic emissions, and advanced operational lifetime, SMA claimed. The news coincides with other companies launching construction on smaller grid-scale projects in Germany. System integrator Intilion has been contracted by utility Baternwerk Natur to provide a 15MW/30MWh BESS for a project in Pfaffenhofen, Bavaria, southern Germany. Thepair have already worked on projects together in Germany, as reported byEnergy-Storage.news. BESS developer-operator Green Flexibility meanwhile will build a 2.5-hour, 10MW/25MWh BESS in Krumbach, also in Bavaira, with an investment of around €10 million (US$11.6 million). It will be deployed in a ‘grid-neutral’ way, Green Flexibility said.Energy-Storage.newsinterviewed CEO Christoph Ostermann forESN Premiumearlier this year.",

    "full_text": "European Commission (EC) funding is supporting a project to integrate battery storage at a pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) plant in Slovakia. The European Union (EU) executive and legislative arm highlighted this week (25 August) that €2.1 million (US$2.44 million) funding is being used for the project, which assesses how best to hybridise the 735MW Cierny Vah PHES plant with a battery energy storage system (BESS) and modernise two of the facility’s six units. The effort is being funded through the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) for Energy, the EU programme to implement Trans-European Networks for Energy policy. It aims to support investments in new cross-border energy infrastructure and upgrades to existing infrastructure. ‘Modernisation of Pumped Hydroelectric Energy Storage in Cierny Vah’ was designated a Project of Common Interest (PCI). It began in October 2024, coordinated by Slovenske Elektrarne, Slovakia’s biggest electricity utility. The state owns 34% of Slovenske Elektrarne, and Slovak Power Holdings, a joint venture between Czech power company EPH and Italy-headquartered Enel, owns the remaining 66%. However, EPH is expected to buy out Enel’s share during this year. The EC said this week that over the next two years, preparation will be made for converting two pumped turbine units to variable-speed turbines, which will improve Cierny Vah’s operational efficiency. At the same time, the optimal configuration and design integration for a BESS of up to 80MW/160MWh will be studied. These studies are expected to define technical specifications for hybridising the PHES plant, from market simulations and financial assessments to detailed technical design of components and control systems. Slovenske Elektrarne has called the project SE Integrator, noting that the need for it arises from the growing share of variable renewable energy (VRE) on the grid. This results in short-term fluctuations, which batteries can help solve, as well as longer-term mismatches between renewable production and grid demand, e.g., daytime solar vs the evening peak. The project will enter the Final Investment Decision (FID) phase upon the conclusion of the EC-funded studies. The European Commission said that in addition to balancing the Slovakian grid, balancing energy could be exported and traded with neighbouring countries such as Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. Various projects involving the hybrid integration of batteries to run-of-river hydroelectric generation facilities have been carried out, are ongoing or are planned around the world, including projects in thePhilippines,Bulgaria,Germanyand other regions. The direct pairing of long-duration energy storage (LDES) pumped hydro with battery storage appears to be a much rarer concept so far, although developersSENS and Callio in Finland announced a project early last year which would combine the two, along with solar PV generation at a decommissioned mine.",

    "full_text": "“Australia is one of the leading countries for grid-forming inverters,” said Natalie Thompson, senior analyst of energy storage and solar at Wood Mackenzie, when discussing the Australian energy storage market. Talking on the ‘Tripling Operational Capacity—Unlocking Market Opportunities and Grid Stability with Grid-Forming BESS’ panel discussion at the Battery Asset Management Summit Australia 2025, Thompson noted that the country is leading in grid-forming inverter deployment, with many other countries not yet considering using the technology. “For Australia, for our population size, we have a pretty world-leading uptake of utility-scale renewables and storage. We are also one of the leading countries in terms of having systems with grid-forming inverters in the next few years,” Thompson notes. “Some countries globally haven’t considered integrating grid-forming as part of their batch of deployments. Grid-forming is very nascent in certain parts of the world, but in Australia, it can be a really interesting use case for other countries.” Grid-forming BESS differs from traditional battery storage systems in its ability to actively stabilise the grid by mimicking the behaviour of synchronous generators. These systems are designed to support thegrid’s operational continuity and ensure uninterrupted power supply, even during grid outages. They often set their own internal voltage waveform reference and can synchronise with the grid or operate independently of other generation sources. This makes them ideal for maintaining system strength in a renewables-dominated grid. One key aspect of a grid-forming BESS is its ability to provide synthetic inertia to maintain the grid’s frequency. Coal, gas, and hydropower plants have traditionally provided this inertia to the grid. However, with the impending withdrawal of coal-fired power, attention has been diverted to emerging technologies that could replace this, such as grid-forming battery storage or synchronous condensers. Examples of grid-forming BESS in Australia include the likes of French independent power producer (IPP)Neoen’s 540MWh Western Downs stage one BESS in Queensland, Australian energy majorAGL Energy’s 2,000MWh Tomago BESS in New South Wales, and specialist infrastructure investorSosteneo’s 370MWh Koorangie BESS in Victoria. During the panel discussion, Thompson also noted the impact data centres are likely to have on electricity demand in countries across the globe and the opportunity that could arise for energy storage. “Globally, we’ve seen some jurisdictions where data centres will represent around 10% of demand, which is quite significant when you see where it is today. Australia is on a bit of a slower trajectory at the moment, but I think that will change rapidly,” Thompson said. The growth indata centresand AI will “transform the global energy sector”, resulting in a surge in energy demand in the next decade. According to a report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), global electricity demand from data centres is set to more than double by 2030 to more than 945TWh annually. This will be driven by demand from “AI-optimised data centres,” which is set to more than quadruple in the same period. Energy storage is being touted as one of the technologies that could help facilitate the uptake of data centres worldwide. For instance, earlier this month, engineering equipment manufacturer Caterpillar announced itwould deploy a combined heat and power (CHP) plant featuring more than a gigawatt-hour of batteries for a new data centre complex in Utah, US, while yesterday,Energy-Storage.newsreported on plans for gigawatt-scale private grid solutions from three developers in the US,each featuring batteries alongside other technologies like nuclear, gas and solar PV. Representing the Energy Corporation of New South Wales (EnergyCo) on the panel discussion was Phil Bratby, executive project director, who commented on theSystem Integrity Protection Scheme (SIPS)for the world’s most powerful BESS: the 850MW/1,680MWh Waratah Super Battery. “Ultimately, the SIPS scheme allows the existing transmission lines to be run harder, essentially, by using up some of the contingent capacity that would be reserved in those power lines,” Bratby said. “That allows us to get more generation from the renewable energy generators, which are located regionally, typically into the load centre, which is Sydney, Newcastle, etc.” The SIPS contract for the Waratah Super Battery is widely recognised as the largest of its kind in Australia. It enables Transgrid to send signals to the BESS to inject energy into the grid while simultaneously instructing paired generators to adjust their output. Specifically, the SIPS Control System can monitor 36 transmission lines in real time and respond instantaneously to system events. This dynamic balancing act prevents disruptions and allows existing transmission infrastructure to operate at higher capacities, effectively “running harder” without compromising reliability. In an exclusive interview withESN Premium, Nick Carter, the CEO of Akaysha Energy, the developer of the Waratah Super Battery, noted thatenabling the first half of the SIPS was “a massive amount of work” despite its relatively simple nature. “It all sounds straightforward, but the actual implementation of it, and doing it at the speed at which we need to do it, in conjunction with the grid connection, in conjunction with the control system, across 288 inverters at a massive site, is really, really hard for a single connection point,” Carter toldESN Premium. Bratby added that the Waratah Super Battery’s functionality means it can still participate in energy arbitrage; however, its true value will be unlocking cheap variable renewable energy generation on the grid. “The Waratah Super Battery can still trade in the arbitrage market; there’s still the ability, depending on different times of the year, we trade different amounts of that battery,” Bratby said. “But the large benefit is towards unlocking that cheap renewable energy generation, such as solar and wind, that would have been constrained otherwise, and getting that into the load centre to make sure that we’ve got enough energy to supply the needs. This brings prices down, because that’s often-displacing gas heating plants and things like that.” Our publisher, Solar Media, will host theEnergy Storage Summit Asia 2025on 7-8 October 2025 in Manila, the Philippines.

    "full_text": "Renewables developer and independent power producer (IPP) TagEnergy has acquired Australian developer ACE Power, adding 6GW of energy storage and renewables projects to its portfolio. The integration of ACE Power’s portfolio will create a combined portfolio exceeding 10GW across Australia. The deal brings a 27-strong development team into the TagEnergy fold, taking the company’s total Australian staff to more than 60. Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed. Still, the acquisition comes after ACE Power’s majority owner, investment firm Pelion Green Future, sought capital to grow the business earlier this year and planned to sell its 80% stake. TagEnergy said it had also acquired the remaining 20% stake from several minority stakeholders, completing a full acquisition of ACE Power. Battery energy storage system (BESS) projects are prominent in the acquisition strategy. TagEnergy confirmed that it plans to prioritise battery storage developments from both companies’ portfolios in the immediate term. TagEnergy will likely focus its efforts on completing the second stage of the 1,333MW Golden Plains wind plant in Victoria, while simultaneously developing its own 150MW/600MWh Golden Plains BESS later this year. The acquisition brings several significant battery storage projects into TagEnergy’s portfolio, includingACE Power’s 900MW/3,600MWh Neboand500MW/2,000MWh Raglan battery energy storage projectsin the Isaac and Gladstone regions of Queensland, respectively. Both of these projects recently securedEnvironment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Actapproval. ACE Power is also looking to develop a1,000MW/8,000MWh BESS in New South Wales, named the Eastern Hub Firming Battery. It is being pursued in the Northern Tablelands region, near Salisbury Plains, approximately 11km southeast of Uralla and 465km north of Sydney. These large-scale battery storage projects align with TagEnergy’s growing focus on storage solutions. At the end of last year, the companylaunched construction of what it claims will be France’s largest BESS when it’s complete: a 240MW/480MWh system being built in the commune of Cernay-lès-Reims, in the department of Marnes. The currentlargest BESS in France was brought online earlier this month by developer Harmony Energy. The 100MW/200MWh Cheviré BESS is located at the port of Nantes Saint-Nazaire Harbour and is claimed to be the first large-scale 2-hour duration BESS in France by Harmony Energy. TagEnergy CEO Franck Woitiez said Australia is one of the most exciting and promising places in the world to deliver the energy transition, whilst emphasising that ACE Power’s early-stage development experience will help TagEnergy capitalise on this opportunity. “We’re integrating ACE Power’s deep expertise in early-stage development with our capabilities in commercialisation, delivery and long-term investment, underpinned by a clear energy management strategy that focuses on delivering greater value for the market, our customers and partners,” Woitiez said. “ACE Power has built a strong reputation as an agile and trusted local developer, and we’re thrilled to welcome their talented team into TagEnergy.” ACE Power founder and managing director Andy Scullion will lead TagEnergy’s development function in Australia. Current head of fevelopment Théo Imbert will move into a new strategy and integration role. For TagEnergy, White & Case provided legal counsel on the transaction, while EY delivered tax and financial advisory services. Aurecon conducted technical due diligence, and Willis Towers Watson and BMS handled insurance matters jointly. Premier Strategy advised on the deal’s community engagement aspects.

    "full_text": "We catch up with the CEO of BESS developer Harmony Energy about its strategy and plans going forward, following the sale of its affiliated Harmony Energy Income Trust (HEIT). The firm was one of the early movers in the UK battery energy storage system (BESS) market, at one time having thetwo largest operational projects in Europe, at 100MW/200MWh each. Those are part of an eight-project portfolio totalling 395.4MW/790.8MWh of capacity which sits withinHarmony Energy Income Trust (HEIT), a listed vehicle set up by Harmony Energy as investment advisor, which had first refusal on the projects Harmony Energy developed and sold in the UK. Following a period of falling UK revenues for BESS,HEIT and other BESS funds saw their valuations plummet and dividends scrapped. HEIT was subsequently sold (and de-listed) to investor Foresight Group, for an enterprise value representing a 94% premium to its share price when it announced it was undergoing a sales process. Harmony Energy continues to provide asset management services for the portfolio. Alongside this, Harmony Energy has been expanding abroad, recentlyenergising France’s largest BESSand developing a large pipeline inPoland,Germanyand Italy. CEO Peter Kavanagh talks us through the process and the strategy going forward in this interview. “The HEIT sale proved what we were saying about the net asset value (the NAV, which the market cap was lower than) and has given us credibility in the market, and solid foundations to grow the business privately,” Kavanagh says. “The sale proved private investors were willing to be more patient, and pay a higher price for assets.” “We’re going to raise funds in September for our significant pipeline, with 14GW at different stages of development, and 1GW ready-to-build in the UK and aiming for 3GW built across Europe in the next five years.” That will be a roughly £300 million (US$403.5 million) fundraise run by JLL which, combined with debt, will go towards building out that pipeline. Harmony Energy will effectively continue as it has done previously, developing, building and operating BESS projects which will be owned by an institutional investment firm, he explains, but this time it will be private capital. “We’ll be selling down equity in the Harmony Topco, so the investor coming in will be taking on some development risk, whereas HEIT was just a yield play. But that also meant investors weren’t accessing the full value of the BESS lifecycle. You’ll have more upside potential than a listed vehicle,” Kavanagh says. Positives around the experience with HEIT include the ability to raise debt and also winning friends with how it ran the fund, Kavanagh says. “We structured our management fee against the share price rather than the NAV. So we absolutely did the right thing for shareholders, but we hadn’t foreseen such a sharp movement in the share price versus the NAV, which was very painful at times.” Harmony energised a 100MW/200MWh project called Cheviré at the port of Nantes Saint-Nazaire Harbour in Franceearlier in August.An outside investor provided construction financing and the firm will now do a refinancing for that, and it has two other projects in France going to build ‘shortly’, another 150MW of capacity. “We wanted to keep that momentum up. We could have waited for an equity check to come in but decided to bring it online early. France is not as well known but it is a very strong market, it’s just not as deep, but if you can get assets online early there are very valuable revenue streams to be captured,” Kavanagh explains. Ancillary service prices are are very attractive right now, he adds, with a good few years left before the need to revert to day-ahead and arbitrage markets. “We’ve always gone for slightly longer duration, to build something that will stand up in the deeper markets.” In Poland, Harmonyrecently sold a 200MW BESS to EDFbut is also taking projects into construction to own and operate. Echoing Harmony Energy Poland’s executive director Michal Maćkowiak, Kavanagh says that the firm is putting less weight onto the country’s capacity market (CM), said to be the bedrock of the business case for storage in Poland. “Poland is one of those markets where the developer margins are trading lower than everyone expected. We think you drive value by building, owning and operating. I think people put a lot of weight on the CM, relying on a single revenue stream heavily. We attribute less weight to that, going for a 2-hour system, we believe that is the optimum size given capex and revenue projections,” he says. “It is a tough market in terms of developing. It took basically 12 months to secure grid connections, and now that market is very locked up in terms of grid. The ones we’ve got are great, and it’s quite hard to develop new sites beyond those.” In Germany, said by many to be the ‘hottest market’ for storage in Europe right now, Harmony is in the process of selling a shovel-ready site. “Our strategy is to build as much as we can, but also by selling one project in each country, that provides us a very valuable data point going into fundraising process, puts cash back in to the business,” says Kavanagh. “In Germany alone we have 2.9GW which should become shovel-ready by end of next year, mainly 300MW sites, we’ve taken the approach of going large early-on. The market is seeing really high revenues and very high floor levels from tier 1 offtakers.” Italy is another market drawing a lot of interest, but the firm is about a year away from having shovel-ready projects meaning it will miss out onthis year’s MACSE auction, which is expected to kick off Italy’s grid-scale storage market. “It’s all about finding the right team and partners on the ground. In France and Germany we were lucky that we knew people already. Italy has been attractive for a while, I don’t feel we’ve missed the opportunity but we’re certainly further behind than where we are in those other markets.” The topic of tolls and contracted revenues has already come up a few times in the conversation, but what is Kavanagh’s overall approach to this versus going merchant? “As a group in the UK, we’ve been sort of more excited about trading merchant risk because there’s more upside as we’ve seen. Now you have these floors coming in at higher levels that’s really helps open up the market to that capital not comfortable with that merchant risk. Really interesting when you hear about the really high debt levels, sometimes north of 80%,” Kavanagh says. “I’ve always been passionate about going merchant as I believe in the upside. But we’ve grown to a size where you should hedge your bets, and I think we’ll split something like 50% merchant and 50% floors and tolling. The tolling side is interesting but that market is only of a certain size.” “From a strategic point of view we are planning mainly merchant, but we’ll definitely utilise a toll or floor offer if it’s attractive.” Harmony has mainly used Tesla for its BESS projects to-date but has started to diversify,enlisting Envision Energy for the final two UK projects that made up the eight-project portfoliowhen they went online in late 2024. “A few years back we realised we need to diversify, to get most attractive pricing and to keep everyone hot-to-trot.

    "full_text": "Three companies, Pacifico Energy, Zenith Volts, and Fermi America have begun expanding power generation and energy storage capabilities for US data centre development. In a February guest blog forEnergy-Storage.news,William Derasmo, partner at US law firm Troutman Pepper Locke, noted that data centres are expected to account for 9% of the US power demand in five years’ time. According to the2025 State of Reliability report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), approximately 1,500 MW of data centres were disconnected simultaneously and unexpectedly from the bulk electric system (BES) in 2024 due to a transmission line fault. Such a significant load loss is comparable to a large nuclear power plant suddenly coming online, resulting in an imbalance due to excess system generation. Due to the rapid construction of data centres, there is a need for generation and storage assets to keep pace. Pacifico, Zenith and Fermi are all taking unique approaches to this issue, each involving the pairing of battery energy storage systems (BESS) with other generation and storage technologies. One other key similarity is the large amounts of land used in all three projects, which allows for future scaling. One approach may prove better, but time will ultimately tell. Japanese renewable energy developer Pacifico Energy has announced plans for its GW Ranch Project, an off-grid power generation campus combining a total of 5GW of gas turbines and battery storage to support hyperscale data centres in Texas, US. GW Ranch aims to deliver 1GW of power in 2028 and 5GW in 2030. The project will have 5GW of dedicated off-grid capacity powered by natural gas and 1.8GW of energy storage. In development since early 2024, GW Ranch is sited within over 8,000 acres in Pecos County, Texas, and will take an “off-grid approach” to “bypass grid interconnection delays and regulatory bottlenecks.” As Pacifico states, the project has started the permitting process with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). It is set to meet all environmental regulatory requirements, and has the support of local officials. Pacifico highlights that the project will be used for AI infrastructure and other power-intensive industries. Since GW Ranch is not connected to the grid, it will allow data centre operators to launch and scale quickly. GW Ranch is also expected to create thousands of construction jobs, generate local tax revenue, and drive long-term investment in regional infrastructure and the community. Constantyn Gieskes, Vice President at Pacifico Energy, said of GW Ranch: “Every aspect of the project has been designed to solve problems with the status quo in data center development. By building off-grid and working hand-in-hand with local officials, we’re delivering the speed, reliability, and responsible development that our customers and communities both demand.” In June, independent power producer (IPP)CleanCapital acquired a 27MW solar and 25MWh battery storage portfolio across Massachusetts and California, from Pacifico. Data centre construction company Zenith Volts has been approved by the Chaves County Commission for a “state-of-the-art” 300-acre data centre project near Roswell, New Mexico. The project is designed to support 1.25GW or more of power capacity with expandable land resources and is expected to be operational by November 2027. According to Zenith, the approved 8,500-acre site will integrate solar, natural gas generators, modular solar-thermal hybrid systems, a 250-acre battery energy storage system (BESS) and geothermal cooling for efficiency. The data centre will support over 600 server racks with 1.25GW or more capacity and expandable land for future growth. The company says the project will create 140 full-time jobs and position Chaves County as a technology and energy hub. Zenith is headquartered in Cheyenne, Wyoming and is looking for technology companies, cloud service providers and “AI innovators” to join as anchor partners in shaping the facility’s computing needs. Fermi America, in partnership with the Texas Tech University (TTU) System, is working with construction firms Parkhill and Lee Lewis to create a private grid supporting AI energy consumption. Lee Lewis and Parkhill are joining a team of experts to develop the 11GW private grid in Amarillo, Texas. Parkhill will design infrastructure solutions to integrate with Fermi’s expansion plans and Lee Lewis will build and manage the site. Fermi was co-founded by former US Energy Secretary Rick Perry. In addition to energy storage, solar power, and natural gas, the company is looking to include new nuclear power at the site. When initially announcing Fermi and TTU’s partnership, the company said it was answering US president Donald Trump’s “call to deliver global energy and AI dominance.” The administration has taken a strong stance on supporting AI development in the US, with the president issuing executive orders such as the ‘Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence’ order. The president has also offered broad support for nuclear power, with the ‘Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security’ executive order. Fermi positions itself as all-in on the president’s commitments to these technologies. Others in the government, such as US Congressman Ronny Jackson, though positioning the project in a sort of Cold War familiarity against China, believe Fermi and TTU will begin a “new chapter of high-impact investment in the Texas Panhandle.” Aside from energy production, Fermi says the partnership will greatly improve the TTU System and advance its mission through academic and research opportunities, as well as workforce training and placement initiatives. Geotechnical work has already begun on the campus, which is expected to deliver 1GW of online power by the end of 2026.",

    "full_text": "Chinese solar PV inverter and energy storage provider Sungrow has announced two major developments: plans for a Hong Kong IPO and the release of its half-year 2025 interim report. On the evening of 25 August, Sungrow announced that it had held its 18th meeting of the fifth board of directors, during which relevant proposals regarding the proposed issuance of H-shares and listing on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited were reviewed and approved. According to the announcement, the company plans to issue overseas-listed foreign shares (H-shares) and apply for listing on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. This initiative aims to deepen its global strategic footprint, enhance its international brand image, build diversified financing channels, and thereby strengthen its core competitiveness. H-shares are issued for firms based in mainland China and listed on the Hong Kong exchange, regulated by Chinese law but denominated in Hong Kong Dollars, enabling Chinese firms to tap broader sources of financing. As previously reported byESN Premium, since the second half of last year, a wave of companies inChina’s energy storage industry have been seeking listings on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. These include players across the industry chain, such as CATL, Sunwoda, BYD, CALB, REPT Battero, Hithium, and Sigenergy. At the same time, Sungrow also disclosed its 2025 interim report. According to the report, from January to June 2025, Sungrow recorded operating revenue of RMB43.533 billion (US$6.09 billion), a year-on-year increase of 40.34%. Net profit attributable to shareholders of the listed company stood at RMB7.735 billion, a year-on-year increase of 55.97%. Its profitability was remarkable, with both revenue and net profit hitting record highs since the company’s listing. The report highlighted the explosive growth in Sungrow’s energy storage business in the first half of the year, with revenue amounting to RMB17.803 billion, a surge of 127.78% year-on-year. During this period, the company launched the PowerTitan 3.0 AC Smart Storage Platform, with the Plus version offering a capacity of up to 12.5MWh, cementing its position as one of the largest energy storage systems in the industry. In the inverter segment, Sungrow generated revenue of RMB15.327 billion, a year-on-year increase of 17.06%. In the first half of the year, the company launched the world’s first 400kW+ string inverter, the SG465HX, and the world’s first split modular inverter, the 1+X 2.0. Behind the impressive performance, two notable shifts have taken place in Sungrow’s business. First, in terms of revenue share, the company’s largest business segment has shifted from PV inverters to energy storage systems, accounting for 35.21% and 40.89% of its total revenue respectively. At the end of 2024, these proportions were 37.41% and 32.06% respectively. Second, overseas business has grown rapidly. Revenue from overseas markets now surpasses that from the Chinese mainland, accounting for 58.30% and 41.70% of total revenue respectively. As of the end of 2024, these proportions were 46.64% and 53.38% respectively. Market research and analysis firm Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables found that Sungrow was the leading energy storage system integrator by market share during 2024 in Europe and the Middle East and second in North America, the Asia-Pacific region, and overall global rankings. According to the annual system integrator market landscape report issued by Wood Mackenzie a few weeks ago,Sungrow doubled its market share in Europe year-on-year. Overall, the market is seeing “tense competition” globally, Wood Mackenzie analyst Kevin Shang toldEnergy-Storage.news.",

    "full_text": "Vertically integrated battery storage manufacturer Hithium will supply two projects in Saudi Arabia with ‘the world’s first mass-produced kiloampere-hour (kAh) cells’. The Chinese manufacturer said this morning that Saudi Electricity Company (SEC), the country’s biggest utility, has awarded it a contract to deploy battery energy storage system (BESS) solutions across two sites in the northern provinces of Tabuk and Hail. Hithium is partnered with Saudi-headquartered engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm Alfanar Projects to deliver the projects. The capacity of individual projects was not disclosed; the two’s total energy storage capacity will be 4GWh. Megawatt output was also undisclosed. Hithium did reveal, however, that the project will use the1175Ah lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells that the company began mass producing earlier this yearat its facility in Chongqing, central China. The cells will be integrated into Hithium’s ∞Power 6.25MWh Desert Eagle, a BESS enclosure specially designed to withstand harsh desert conditions. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia targets 50% of its electricity coming from renewable sources by 2030, necessitating 48GWh of energy storage. The contract for Hithium follows Saudi Electricity Company signing a12.5GWh order with rival Chinese maker BYDin February, afterthe successful delivery of the 2.6GWh Bisha BESS project. Hithium launched its desert-specific BESS solution at an event in October last year. The system is designed to be reliable in operation at temperatures from -30°C to 60°C due to multi-layer insulation, which reduces its internal temperature by up to 10°C. Fully sealed components are designed to protect against sandstorms, while automated dust alerts lessen the need for maintenance and the company claims durable components have been selected that are rated for more than 40,000 hours of continuous operation. The Chinese manufacturer also said in launching the product last year that it will build aBESS factory in Saudi Arabia with 5GWh annual production capacity through Hithium MANAT, a joint venture with Saudi engineering solutions company MANAT. The company claims to have made breakthroughs in design and manufacturing techniques that enabled it to make cells three times bigger than the 314Ah cells commonly integrated into large-scale BESS solutions. That appears to put Hithium ahead of its peers in China. Major manufacturers of batteries for energy storage applications exhibiting at this year’s SNEC industry event in May showcased larger-format battery cells, butwhile 500Ah appeared to be a new standard and 600Ah+ cells an outlier pursued by a handful of players, Hithium has the head start on kiloampere-hour cells, which it said can effectively perform long-duration energy storage (LDES) applications. Increasing sizes of battery cell and commensurate improvements in energy density areamong the main drivers of cost reduction from a technology perspective, BloombergNEF (BNEF) analyst Isshu Kikuma told ESN Premium earlier this year.",

    "full_text": "“Battery energy storage systems (BESS) typically change ownership between two and four times during their 40-year lifecycle,” John Sheehy, CEO of Pottinger, said on day two of the Battery Asset Management Summit Australia 2025 this morning. Discussing asset management on the ‘M&A and Engaging the Investor’ panel discussion, Sheehy of investment advisory firm Pottinger also noted that mergers and acquisitions (M&A) play an “incredibly important role” in the deployment of BESS. “M&A is really important in shifting the profile from a cost of capital, from a risk profile as you move through the development stages and into operations and through the life of the battery,” Sheehy added. Paul Peters, CEO of the New South Wales Energy Security Corporation (ESC), whichlaunched at the start of July, and Alexander Austin, CEO of Infradebt, also participated in the panel discussion. The ESC was established under the Energy Security Corporation Act 2024. According to itsofficial website, the organisation will invest between AU$25 million (US$16.25 million) and AU$150 million per project. It has been armed with an initial funding allocation of AU$1 billion and an investment mandate that focuses on short – to long-duration energy storage (LDES) projects. Peters emphasised the need for longer-duration energy storage in New South Wales to maintain grid reliability amid growing concerns that the state will likelyexperience grid-reliability issues in 2027-28 without intervention. “Of the 14 battery projects in the state today, 11 of them are two hours. That’s not enough duration, so we’re very focused on longer duration, such as four hours, eight hours, and getting some momentum into the market for those to get close, but to get to operation,” Peters added. The state’s ESC will result in an overall expansion of private sector renewable energy investment in New South Wales, similar to how theCommonwealth’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC)has expanded total renewable energy investment across Australia. In addition to these factors, Austin believes that it is not only possible to go 100% merchant with a BESS without input from initiatives such as the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS), which has a revenue floor and cap, but the organisation is already delivering these. “We have done several pure merchant BESS projects. We created a specialist battery debt fund with the unfortunate acronym of ETF: the Energy Transition Fund,” Austin begins. “ETF was created to provide debt finance to predominantly merchant batteries. We do everything from full merchant to 50/50; it’s here. That’s part of what we see as our niche in the market.” Our publisher, Solar Media, will host theEnergy Storage Summit Asia 2025on 7-8 October 2025 in Manila, the Philippines.

    "full_text": "IPP Neoen has enlisted BESS supplier NHOA Energy for its first energy storage project in Italy. NHOA Energy will supply Neoen with the battery energy storage system (BESS) technology for the 10MW/51MWh ‘Broni Battery’ project, in the province of Pavia, Northern Italy. The project has a 15-year Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (or capacity market) contract awarded by transmission system operator (TSO) Terna in the December 2024 auction, for delivery from Q1 2026. The auction cleared at €56,000 (US$65,000) per MW of ‘probability-weighted’ power per year, NHOA toldEnergy-Storage.news,referring to what is more commonly known as a de-rating factor. Four-hour BESS have a 67% de-rating factor, meaning the de-rated or probability-weighted capacity of the Broni project contract is 7MW. The successive auction for 2027 delivery was held in February 2025 and cleared at €47k/MW/year. The business case for grid-scale energy storage in Italy looks set to be driven by the capacity market in the North of Italy and the MACSE scheme (Meccanismo di Approvvigionamento di Capacità di Stoccaggio Elettrico) in the South/Central regions of the country. Both provide 15 years of contracted revenues. The capacity market, where contract holders are obligated to bid in the day-ahead and ancillary services markets, may make up 30-40% of BESS project revenues, according to some estimates. The first MACSE auctions will run at the end of September. Winning projects’ capacity will effectively be handed over to Terna for use in a time-shifting platform serving renewable asset owners, and projects in MACSE will derive up to 80% of their revenues from it, analysts estimate. Together, the two schemes should enable the commissioning by early 2028 of at least 20GWh of BESS capacity in Italy. Terna is targeting 50GWh of new energy storage by 2030. However, one developer-operator weinterviewed recently forESN Premiumreckoned that target might be overly ambitious. BESS will also play in the country’s ancillary service markets, although its future role providing grid-forming services like voltage control and inertia is uncertain following Terna’s self-procurement of substantial synchronous condenser capacity. Though it’s gone through several changes of ownership and name, NHOA was originally founded in Italy in 2005 as Electro Power Systems (EPS), before being acquired by utility and power firm Engie, which then sold it to Taiwan Cement Corporation (TCC),a deal which completed in late 2024. NHOA therefore has plenty of experience in the Italian energy storage market, recentlyworking on 39MWhand50MWh projects for customers. While it is Neoen’s first BESS in Italy, the Brookfield-owned independent power producer (IPP) is highly active in the energy storage market elsewhere. We’ve recently reported on its projects inCanada,Australia,Finland,SwedenandGermany.",

    "full_text": "Governor of New Jersey, US, Phil Murphy, has signed legislation to reach 2,000MW of energy storage capacity by 2030 and nearly double the state’s clean energy capacity. Legislation A5267/S4289 introduces a transmission-scale energy storage incentive programme, aiming to meet New Jersey’s target of 2,000MW of energy storage by 2030. This initiative seeks to expedite the installation of new clean energy capacity and lower costs for New Jersey’s energy customers. Under S4530/A5768, the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) will launch registration for an additional 3,000MW of community solar projects on 1 October 2025. The governor’s office says this move will significantly expand New Jersey’s solar initiatives, enabling families and businesses to reduce their monthly electric bills. These pieces of legislation enable the rapid expansion of New Jersey’s community solar programme and the swift creation of new energy storage facilities. Under the Murphy Administration, solar PV generation capacity has increased from 2.4GW to 5.2GW, with solar now powering over 600,000 homes. The governor’s office claims that rising energy costs in the state result from mismanagement by the regional grid operator, PJM. Murphy has also called for a formal investigation “into the energy cost crisis facilitated by PJM,” announced US$430 million in direct relief for New Jersey ratepayers, sent a bipartisan letter demanding transparency and oversight from PJM, and signed legislation increasing public accountability from grid operators. In June,the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) approved the first phase of the Garden State Energy Storage Programme (GSESP). At the time, the NJBPU noted that the speed at which energy storage systems (ESS) can be built is crucial, as the state cannot build “traditional” power plants within five years due to supply chain issues. Senator Smith, Chair of the Senate Energy Committee, said of the legislation: “By incentivising and procuring the creation of transmission-scale energy storage, we will enable a wider application of clean energy that can charge and store energy at low-cost hours then discharge at high-cost, high-demand hours, thus lowering overall costs and smoothing demand spikes on the grid.” Smith continued, “This legislation will help keep New Jersey at the forefront of investments in new, clean energy technology, even as the current federal administration seeks to sabotage our environment and our renewable future.”",

    "full_text": "After an initial rush to deploy megawatts that gave CAISO and ERCOT the lead in US BESS adoption, both markets have become focused on capacity and availability, writes Amit Mathrani of Rabobank Americas. This is an extract of a feature article that originally appeared inVol.43 of PV Tech Power, Solar Media’s quarterly journal covering the solar and storage industries. Every edition includes ‘Storage & Smart Power’, a dedicated section contributed by the Energy-Storage.news team,and full access to upcoming issues as well as the 10-year back catalogue is included as part of a subscription toEnergy-Storage.news Premium. Battery energy storage has sprinted from niche experiment to indispensable grid asset in barely half a decade. Nowhere is that transformation clearer than in California and Texas. By the end of 2024, the California ISO (CAISO) operated 12.5GW of utility-scale battery capacity, up from just 1GW in 2020, while the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) surged from essentially 0.5GW to 10GW over the same period. Together, these two markets now host a little more than 65% of all US grid-connected battery storage capacity (see Figure 1 below). The similarities end with scale. CAISO’s build-out has been propelled by policy mandates and long-term Resource Adequacy (RA) contracts that favour 4-hour duration, close to urban load centres. ERCOT’s boom, by contrast, has unfolded in a pure merchant setting, with no capacity market, minimal regulatory guardrails, and revenues earned (or lost) in real-time energy and ancillary service markets. The result is a dual stress test on the same technology. California now grapples with revenue compression and interconnection logjams, Texas with price cannibalisation, transmission bottlenecks, and a push towards multi-hour discharge. These contrasts preview the grid’s next chapter. Duration is edging out volume, siting advantage now beats speed, and investors increasingly prize fluency with evolving policy rules and flawless operations. Other ISOs – PJM, MISO, NYISO – are already importing elements of both playbooks. To see where battery economics and grid planning are headed next, let’s start with California and Texas. California and Texas share the same headline: double-digit-gigawatt battery fleets built in record time. However, the mechanics behind that growth could not be further apart. CAISO’s 12.5GW of operating BESS is the product of a policy-catalysed glide path: mid-term reliability mandates such as the California Public Utilities Commission’s (CPUC) 15.5GW of clean capacity by 2027, a 4-hour resource adequacy standard that underpins long-term offtake contracts, and interconnection reforms that now screen projects for site control and deliverability before they enter detailed study. By Contrast, ERCOT’s 10GW of operating capacity has been built almost entirely without mandates, capacity payments, or federal oversight. Early projects were mostly 1-hour systems chasing ancillary service revenue. Currently, the fleet averages 1.5-2 hours, and the queue mix is expected to shift toward 4-hour duration ahead of the Dispatchable Reliability Reserve Service (DRRS) launch in ERCOT in 2026 to compensate resources that can provide at least four hours of continuous energy during emergency conditions, supporting system stability without requiring formal capacity obligations. For investors, the divergence frames a strategic spectrum: from California’s contract-anchored, lower-beta returns to Texas’s volatility-driven, higher-beta upside. Understanding where a new market will sit on that spectrum is now the opening question in any storage diligence process. Batteries that earn today sit where the grid needs relief – nodes defined by congestion, scarcity and price spikes. Interconnection headroom and transmission topology decide which projects reach commercial operation and which languish in restudy, with no developer enthusiasm. Southern California still remains attractive to battery storage developers. As of April 2025, SP-15 hosts more than 51GW of storage requests, over three times the capacity queued in either ZP-26 or NP-15. The sheer weight of applications has forced CAISO to rewrite its interconnection rulebook. In response to FERC’s Order 2023, CAISO’s May 2025 tariff amendment now requires every new requester to prove 90% site control on Day One and 100% before signing a Large Generator Interconnection Agreement [1, 2]. Projects that miss the market drop to the back of the line. A parallel reform introduces a screening stage that ranks projects on viability and alignment with state resource plans before they enter full study. History justifies the clampdown. As Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s (LBNL’s)Queued Up 2024survey showed, only 12% of CAISO requests submitted between 2000 and 2018 reached commercial operation, the lowest build rate among US ISOs. Each late-stage withdrawal triggers restudies that delay the rest of the cluster, raising carrying costs and eroding tax-credit timing. Investors now treat queue position and deliverability status as hard diligence gates, equal to offtake strength. Transmission headroom is equally selective. CAISO’s 2024-2025 Transmission Plan identifies US$4.8 billion in upgrades, but most come online after 2029, leaving near-term projects exposed to local congestion, especially around solar-heavy Kern and Fresno counties. ERCOT still moves projects from application to energisation in 18-30 months. Lightning speed by ISO standards. However, geography is beginning to narrow the fast lane. The 2024 ERCOT Constraints & Needs report lists the Tonkawa Switch – Morgan Creek 345kV path as the single most expensive constraint on the system, absorbing US$156 million in congestion rent between October 2023 and November 2024. The broader West Texas Export Interface booked US$148 million over the same period, and ERCOT’s economic forecast shows rents rising to US$178 million in 2026 without new wires. Batteries sited behind those bottlenecks often clear into the real-time market but collect a discounted nodal price. Houston, once considered congestion-proof, is not immune. Projected constraints in the North-Houston Interface reach US$46 million in annual congestion rent by 2026. ERCOT has endorsed a US$2.2 billion pipeline of upgrades, yet most will enter service after 2027, meaning today’s queue will energise into tomorrow’s pinch-points. Sponsors installing batteries on the load side of a popular constraint are starting to price nodal basis risk the way wind developers priced curtailment a decade ago. For developers and lenders, congestion risk now shapes deal terms as much as project size. Lenders are paying closer attention to site control, deliverability studies, and nodal-price hedging, knowing that a project stuck behind a constraint can miss the very spreads its model assumed. At the federal level, this year’s Independence Day celebrations brought clarity. The ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act’ left the 30% standalone storage ITC, created by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), intact through 2032 – no phase downs, no haircut. The catch is provenance. Starting in 2028, battery cells or packs with more than 30% ‘foreign entity of concern’ (FEOC) content lose the credit, and the 15% Section 301 tariff reinstated in May for Chinese lithium-ion cells remains in force. Tax equity is safe, but only for projects that can document an increasingly domestic supply chain. Policy still leaves plenty of runway for storage, but the path isn’t straight anymore. Anyone building or financing battery storage projects under these policy crosswinds now spends as much time following committee hearings and tariff dockets as they do watching price curves. The question for storage assets has shifted from, “Can the BESS project make money?” to, “Can it keep that revenue once SoC rules, outage penalties, insurance costs and degradation kick in?” Operational discipline now drives the gap between a deal that meets pro-forma and one that backpedals on covenants. CAISO has required 4-hour batteries to hold a minimum reserve going into the evening ramp. The rule was supposed to sunset in 2024; instead, the ISO extended it through 2026 while it evaluates longer-term reliability options. The extension means storage resources must hold energy through the late afternoon peak with a preset charge margin or face potential bidding restrictions and availability penalties. At the same time, availability risk is widening. CAISO’s Q4 2024 Market Issues & Performance Report shows battery outages, planned and forced, rose 26% Y-o-Y, reflecting both rapid fleet expansion and longer downtimes for fire safety retrofits. The most public reminder came on January 2025, when a thermal runaway event at Vistra’s 300MW Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility forced a three-month outage and community air-quality monitoring. While no injuries occurred, the incident hardened lender and insurer attitudes overnight. Verisk – Munich Re highlight tighter underwriting criteria for lithium projects lacking dedicated setbacks or advanced suppression. Performance penalties compound those cost pressures. In a typical CAISO 4-hour Resource Adequacy contract, a single missed dispatch during a system stress hour can forfeit an entire month of capacity payments. An outcome that now carries more weight than day-ahead spread assumptions in many debt models. Sponsors respond by investing in redundant battery-management telemetry, automated SoC forecasting, and additional fire suppression layers that push EPC budgets up by 2-3% but protect far larger revenue streams. Texas presents a different operational gauntlet. ERCOT’s merchant batteries cycle more frequently, often three to four times per day during shoulder seasons, to capture brief price spikes that still emerge between solar oversupply and evening peaks. High-cycle operation accelerates degradation. Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) packs rated at 10,000 cycles see usable energy fall below 80% of nameplate in seven years under ERCOT’s dispatch pattern, compared with ten years in CAISO’s less frenetic market, according to performance warranties filed with two recent interconnection agreements. That degradation matters because ERCOT’s forthcoming DRRS imposes a 4-hour continuous-discharge requirement. Sponsors that fall short risk losing DRRS eligibility unless they augment mid-life with new modules. In a market where spreads compress faster than projects retire, operational proof is becoming the last lever left to protect asset value. Battery storage’s first phase was a land-grab for megawatts. The second is proving to be a contest of selective discipline. Together, California and Texas host roughly 60% of all US grid-connected capacity, offering a preview of what the rest of the country will soon confront. From their experience, five strategic signals stand out. Duration premiums harden quickly once price spikes fade.ERCOT’s ELCC tables already value 5-hour systems at nearly five times the dependable capacity of 1-hour units; CPUC modelling now assumes 8-hour resources enter by 2030. Markets that still reward 1-hour batteries are living on borrowed time. Deliverability trumps queue position.CAISO’s viability screen and Texas’ looming congestion bottlenecks mean a smaller, well-sited project can secure cheaper capital than a larger asset stuck behind a restudy or constraint. Rule-defined revenues outlast merchant spreads.4-hour Resource Adequacy in California and the forthcoming 4-hour DRRS product in Texas have replaced opportunistic arbitrage as the anchor cash flow. Future markets—PJM’s capacity reforms, MISO’s seasonal accreditation— are heading the same way. Operational discipline is no longer optional.A single missed stress-hour dispatch can wipe out a month of RA payments; a thermal event can raise insurance costs across an entire portfolio. Lenders now treat SoC telemetry, fire suppression audits, and augmentation reserves as gating items, not nice-to-haves. Policy risk is a two-sided coin.The ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act’ kept the ITC for storage but tightened the FEOC rules; state legislatures can pivot from laissezfaire to duration mandates in one session. References Hedging that volatility through flexible design, staged capex, and locational optionality will separate resilient balance sheets from speculative bets. Put bluntly, the next phase belongs to those that match hours to need, electrons to the right node, and operations to ever-stricter rulebooks, before the rules tighten further.

    "full_text": "Suriya Edwards and Deborah Harvey, partners specialising in battery energy storage at law firm Freeths LLP, analyse new EU battery regulations around suppliers’ responsibility for collecting, treating and recycling collected batteries. The battery regulatory landscape in the EU saw a significant shift in approach on 18 August 2025. The now familiar Directive 2006/66/EC has been repealed with effect from that date. This has significant implications as to who pays for the collection, treatment and recycling of batteries. The shift change is being brought about by Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 which will fully replace Directive 2006/66/EC, and simultaneously it brings into effect on 18 August 2025 new regulations on the management of waste batteries and extended producer responsibilities. The 2023 Regulation introduces enhanced obligations for producers of all categories of batteries such as industrial, SLI (starting, lighting, ignition) and electric vehicle batteries to take back waste batteries regardless of their shape, volume, weight, design, material composition, chemistry, use or purpose. These new obligations aim to improve sustainability, transparency, and circularity in battery use and disposal. The financial responsibility of the producer for the recycling of used batteries is expressed in recitals 101 and 106 of the 2023 Regulation. This provides that “producers should have extended producer responsibility for the management of their batteries at the end-of-life stage. Accordingly, they should finance the costs of collecting, treating and recycling all collected batteries, carrying out compositional surveys of mixed collected municipal waste, reporting on batteries and waste batteries, and of providing information to end-users and waste operators about batteries and appropriate re-use and management of waste batteries…” Producers (in the EU market) therefore will have the responsibility to finance the costs of collection, treatment and recycling, of batteries. Importantly the 2023 Regulation does not expressly deal with contractual transfer of the cost of recycling to the end-user / or buyer (as was possible previously); such attempts to transfer costs may prove to be inadmissible (not allowed). Of course, the 2023 Regulation permits producers to itemise these costs at the point of sale (that is to build in the price at the supply contract or EPC contract price stage), however it remains questionable how feasible this is to do. How can costs be projected years ahead, within what could be a very different regulatory landscape? By contrast UK’s Waste Batteries and Accumulators Regulations 2009 (“WBAR 2009”) is based on the earlier Directive 2006/66/EC, where producers are obliged to take back batteries from end users within a reasonable time if they are producers in the compliance period when the request for take back is made. WBAR 2009, however, continues to facilitate contractual cost sharing in respect of the take-back costs of the producer. This means the UK position will now diverge from the EU position. We think that this can provide legal and commercial complexities for producers operating in the EMEA market. While some producers may seek to recover recycling costs through upfront pricing mechanisms, this approach will be difficult to implement in a price sensitive market, and vulnerable to legal scrutiny if it undermines the 2023 Regulation’s free-of-charge take-back obligation. We’re therefore likely to see varied practices in respect of how producers deal with end-of-life costs. We expect these could involve contract price adjustments, reimbursement mechanisms (which will need to be scrutinised by legal teams including those of investors undertaking due diligence), or provisions that are situated within severability provisions. Given that battery regulations can be updated and changed over the operational lifetime of a battery, the regulatory landscape could of course also change between now and then. Breaches of the EU Directive could of course have local law implications as the Directive is implemented. The EU-UK juxtaposition also creates practical challenges for businesses operating across both jurisdictions. While UK producers may contractually allocate recycling costs, EU producers will need to be seen to absorb them entirely.

    "full_text": "Battery energy storage system (BESS) project developer Pacific Green Technologies has secured a AU$77 million (US$49.9 million) debt facility for projects in Australia. The UK-headquartered company’s playbook involves developing large-scale standalone BESS assets in Europe and Australia. Pacific Green describes these developments as Energy Storage Parks, and in Australia in particular, most of its targeted opportunities are planned to have more than a gigawatt-hour of storage capacity per site. Its latest move is to get financing commitments from Australian private debt investment manager Longreach Credit Investors and non-profit investment fund Australian Philanthropic Services Foundation. The investors have agreed to provide the financing over a 24-month period. Pacific Green said it would go towards developing a 7GWh project pipeline and expanding the company’s platform within the booming Australian market. “This capital allows Pacific Green to expand our platform footprint and accelerate the development of our portfolio of BESS projects across the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM),” Pacific Green CEO Scott Poulter said. Battery storage systems are the clean energy technology with the highest levels of reliability, according to the new edition of the annualElectricity Statement of Opportunitiesreport from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), which came out a few days ago. Pacific Green was founded in 2016 and was active in marine exhaust scrubbing machinery before entering the energy storage space two years later. In 2021, it acquired the battery storage consulting business of Limejump, the UK-headquartered energy trader and BESS optimiser, the rest of which was bought up by Shell. The developer then acquired the rights to its first two projects, both in the UK, a few months later. The first of those two projects, the99.8MW/99.8MWh Richborough Energy Park in southern England, went online in late 2023, while the other, 250MW/375MWh Sheaf Energy Park is currently under construction on adjacent land. Its BESS supplier to Richborough was Chinese battery manufacturer Gotion High-Tech. It has since signed a letter of intent (LOI) for thesupply of 1,500MWh of systems at Energy Parks “across multiple jurisdictions” from Trina Storage, the BESS arm of Chinese solar major Trinasolar. In Australia, Pacific Green announced its ‘strategic entry’ into the market in October 2023 withmoves to secure land for 1GW/2.5GWh of Energy Parks in Victoria, which, at the time, it had hoped to move into construction during 2024 for commercial operation to start in 2026. Since then, it has secured planning consent from the government ofSouth Australia for its 500MW/1,500MWh Limestone Coast Energy Parkin July 2024—which it has since sold to investorIntera Renewables for AU$460 millionand signed upTrina Storage as supplier—applied for approval under Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act, for its 1GW/2.5GWh Portland BESS in Victoria. A few weeks ago, Pacific Green signed a10-year tolling agreement with developer ZEN Energy for three Australian BESS projects totalling 1.5GWhof capacity at three sites, one in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, although the specific projects were not named in a company announcement.

    "full_text": "“We’re expecting the results of the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) Tender 3 in the coming weeks,” Thimo Mueller, general manager, commercial at AusEnergy Services Ltd (ASL), said in the opening keynote of the Battery Asset Management Summit Australia 2025 this morning. The CIS Tender 3 opened in March 2025 and closed in May 2025. It sought to secure 4GW of 4-hour duration equivalent dispatchable capacity, or 16GWh. These projects are expected to be operational before 31 December 2029. Successful bidders in Tender 3 will enter into a Capacity Investment Scheme Agreement (CISA), which provides a revenue safety net through an underwriting approach. “There will be many more projects, many more battery energy storage systems (BESS) being supported by the Capacity Investment Scheme,” Mueller adds. Alongside the CIS initiative, which has been instrumental in scaling energy storage and renewable energy generation across Australia, withWestern Australia also featuring in the scheme, ASL, formerly AEMO Services, before its rebranding last month, is also supporting New South Wales in a new firming tender. “We are preparing for a 500MW firming tender in New South Wales. The focus is for projects to provide energy into the region of New South Wales, and projects need to be operational by the summer of 2027 to participate in that tender,” Mueller said. The500MW tender was first announcedby the New South Wales minister for climate change and energy, Penny Sharpe, at the Clean Energy Council’s Australian Clean Energy Summit 2025 in Sydney last month. The competitive tender process is targeting projects that must be operational by 2028. It will specifically focus on the Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong areas where capacity shortfalls areforecast to occur beginning in the summer of 2027-28. Regarding the 500MW firming tender, Mueller added that ASL is “very keen on receiving bids from aggregated portfolios of smaller batteries, because they usually have a shorter return.” Last month, the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) has announced plans to run four Capacity Investment Scheme tenders by the end of 2025. These will be for theNational Electricity Market (NEM), which spans Australia’s eastern and southern coasts and Tasmania, and theWholesale Electricity Market (WEM), which covers Western Australia. The tenders will be evenly split between the two markets, with each set to have a generation and dispatchable tender. Tenders 5 and 6, specific to the WEM, will begin in August 2025. Tenders 7 and 8, for the NEM, will commence in September and November, respectively. It is worth noting that aconsultation on the design of the CIS tender in the WEM ran earlier this year, and the feedback will guide future rounds.",

The project will be developed in the Northwest Quadrant Project Area in Salt Lake City, adjacent to the Rocky Mountain Power Terminal Substation. NEER is operating the project through its subsidiary Dominguez Energy Storage, LLC. UIPA states that the project aims to improve the region’s power infrastructure by offering extra capacity during peak demand periods, while also promoting a more sustainable energy mix for the state. UIPA’s support includes a proposed annual property tax rebate, available upon project completion. Depending on the facility’s operational status and adherence to certain conditions, such as minimal water usage and a corporate stewardship plan, the rebate can continue for up to 25 years. At a previous UIPA board meeting, Glenn Shober, project director at NEER, clarified that Dominguez Energy Storage would serve not only the Salt Lake area but also provide a reliable energy resource for industries with around-the-clock operations. On 1 May 2024, the UIPA Incentives Committee reviewed and recommended this incentive. The board’s approval is considered a crucial step in advancing the project, allowing NEER to move forward with the development of Dominguez Energy Storage. Utah will also be the home of data centredeveloper Joule Capital Partners’ data centre campus with 1.1GWh of integrated BESS. Earlier this month, engineering equipment manufacturer Caterpillar agreed to deploy a combined heat and power (CHP) plant featuring the BESS for the campus. In June,rPlus Energies secured over US$500 million for a 400MW/1.6GWh solar-plus-storage project in Emery County, Utah. Shober said of Dominguez Energy Storage, “Battery energy storage is being requested more frequently by grid operators like Rocky Mountain Power.” He continued, “This project will support the entire region by providing crucial capacity, especially during peak load times.”",

    "full_text": "Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) has laid the groundwork for a new 120MWh distribution-connected portfolio of battery energy storage system (BESS) projects. Despite some utilities in the US shelving plans for additional BESS,such as Louisville Gas and Electric Company (LG&E) and Kentucky Utilities Company (KU), PNM is seeking regulatory approval of the new portfolio with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC). The utility is targeting 100% emissions-free electricity generation by 2040. As explained in recent documents filed with the NMPRC, PNM is seeking a certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) to install 6MW/24MWh individual BESS facilities at five of its operational solar plants located in five different counties across the state. The portfolio is the result of an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) RFP which the utility issued earlier this year in January for suppliers to deliver the portfolio. Details of the five PNM-owned solar sites to be retrofitted with BESS can be found below: After receiving bids from three suppliers, PNM negotiated a deal with Albuquerque, New Mexico-based EPC specialist Gridworks, which will deliver the project as part of a turnkey solution. As previously reported byEnergy-Storage.news,this isn’t the first time Gridworks has been successful in a PNM-administered RFP,after it secured an EPC contract last year to deliver a 30MW/120MWh co-located BESS for the utility. Recent filings with the NMPRC reveal that the utility included Tesla’s 2XL Megapack in planning documents for the five sites that use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technology. However, this does not necessarily mean Tesla Megapacks will eventually be procured for the project, as planning submissions can indicate an intended design to show regulators and authorities. As explained by PNM as part of its application, LFP technology is “widely recognised as the safest option for utility scale storage due to its minimal risk of thermal runaway compared to chemistries such as nickel manganese cobalt (NMC).” As part of its justification for the project, PNM believes the project will reduce its use of fossil fuels to meet peak system demand while also reducing costs for customers. “By storing excess solar energy for use during peak demand, the BESS reduces curtailment of renewable generation and offsets the historical reliance on fossil-fuelled resources during high-demand periods,” explained Engineering Manager for PNM, Nicholas Pollman, as part of a recent testimony filed with the NMPRC. If operated to its maximum potential, PNM claims the BESS portfolio will eliminate more than 18,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year through the avoidance of equivalent fossil fuel usage. The estimated cost of the installations is approximately US$78.7 million, which PNM plans to recover as part of a future rate case. Of the total estimated cost, Gridworks is set to receive US$71.5 million to “fully design, engineer, and install” the systems’ BESS technology, which will be transferred to PNM upon completion. PNM has requested the NMPRC approve the CPCN no later than May 6 2026 in order to deliver the project by June 2027 in time for the utility’s peak electricity demand which is expected to occur during the summer. With investment tax credits (ITCs) for utility-scale storage havingavoided an early phaseoutdue to last-minute changes to the so-called ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act,’ (‘OBBB’), PNM expects to receive approximately US$28 million in benefits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). PNM has estimated an ITC benefit of 30% – 40% for each project, with the utility expecting all five projects to receive the base 6% credit along with the 24% credit adder for Prevailing Wages & Apprenticeship. It also expects three out of the five to qualify for the additional 10% ‘Energy Communities’ adder. As part of its calculations, PNM excluded the additional 10% ‘Domestic Content’ adder, which it said will only be determined “at the time the batteries and equipment are ordered” for the BESS portfolio. PNM says that any 48E ITC benefit it receives to offset tax liability will be returned to customers. In May, PNM’s parent company, TXNM Energy, agreed to a takeover deal by global asset manager Blackstone Infrastructure. In early 2024, two-yearnegotiations over a merger between PNM and Iberdrola subsidiary Avangrid came to an endwithout a deal following legal delays.",

    "full_text": "Several new community batteries have launched in Victoria and Queensland, Australia, to help soak up distributed rooftop solar PV. The new community batteries have been launched on Phillip Island, located to the south of the state capital, Melbourne, and in the small town of Merland, in the Central Highlands region of Queensland. Six out of seven community batteries have been installed on Phillip Island in Victoria thus far. These battery energy storage systems (BESS) total 900kW/1,845kWh across seven locations on the island, including Cowes and Wimbledon Heights. The batteries are a joint project between Mondo Energy, the commercial arm of network operator AusNet, the Bass Coast Shire Council and Totally Renewable Phillip Island. The Victoria government has confirmed that the community batteries have been delivered as part of its 100 Neighbourhood Batteries Program. This initiative aims to empower communities in Victoria to benefit from rooftop solar PV without requiring individual home battery systems. Through the Neighbourhood Battery Initiative grant programme, the Victorian state government is offering up to AU$400,000 (US$257,095) per project to applicants who can demonstrate multi-use case applications for BESS. Thethird round of this programme launched in July 2025, with AU$6.6 million earmarked for the technology across the state. The initiative covers systems that include a neighbourhood battery, solar PV, a generator, and a management system. Each battery must be a minimum of 20kW/40kWh and a maximum of 5MW/20MWh. Meanwhile, in Queensland, state-owned energy company Energy Queensland has switched on a new 4MW/8MWh community battery in the town of Emerald. According to the Queensland government statement, the community battery is designed to capture the distributed rooftop solar PV systems located across the town. This amounts to around 18.4MW of generation capacity and roughly 28% of the community. Energy Queensland is currently constructing or energizing a new unit in its fleet of 30 local network-connected batteries across the state. These batteries will be utilized for network support, and any excess capacity will be shared with a retailer to trade on the National Electricity Market (NEM). This arrangement aims to maximise the benefits of the battery by reducing both network and wholesale costs. According to the state government, 18 community batteries have already been energised around the State, and 12 more are under construction and on track to be completed this financial year. Queensland’s treasurer and minister for energy, David Janetzki, said increasing the amount of energy in the market would put downward pressure on power prices. “This battery in Emerald is playing a key role in supporting Ergon Energy’s networks to gain the maximum advantage from Queensland’s abundant rooftop solar systems,” Janetzki said. “Each battery enables renewable energy to be stored locally and can support up to 500 homes in the evening peak load period, making better use of locally generated solar power when the sun goes down.” Last week, state-owned utilityWestern Power commissioned five new community batteries in Perth suburbsas part of a federally funded initiative in Western Australia. The organisation confirmed that five community BESS, each 500kW/2,800kWh, have been installed in the suburbs of Coogee, Kinross, Bayswater, Stratton and Port Kennedy.

    "full_text": "The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has found that battery energy storage systems (BESS) are the most reliable clean energy technology in the National Electricity Market (NEM). According to AEMO’s new2025 Electricity Statement of Opportunitiesreport, battery energy storage systems demonstrate the highest reliability, with approximately 70% of the NEM’s fleet having experienced unplanned outage rates of only 0-5%. It adds that longer-duration storage, defined as 4-hours or more, is more effective at reducing reliability risks than shorter-duration storage. This is because in 2030-31, expected USE in South Australia is forecast to exceed the reliability standard, with some shortfall events lasting more than four hours. In such conditions, AEMO said 2-hour battery storage systems are typically exhausted early, providing no reliability benefits for later hours of the forecast USE event. By contrast, longer duration storage can sustain output over a larger portion or even across the full duration of these USE events. Energy storage continues to emerge as a critical component of Australia’s energy transition strategy. AEMO’s report reveals various storage durations and their effectiveness in meeting reliability standards, providing crucial insights for developers and policymakers. Indeed, several different technology combinations in South Australia could be sought to help reduce expected unserved energy (USE) and meet reliability standards by 2030-31. For instance, AEMO states that 820MW of 2-hour storage would be required to reduce expected USE to meet the reliability standard. In contrast, less than half that capacity is needed if the storage has a duration of 4-hours or more – specifically, 365MW of 4-hour storage would suffice. The report also demonstrates that longer-duration storage options could provide increasingly efficient solutions: 6-hour duration storage, for example, would require 320MW. In contrast, 8-hour storage would need approximately 315MW to achieve the same reliability outcomes. According to AEMO, hybrid configurations show even greater efficiency gains. When wind is combined with 4-hour duration energy storage, the requirement drops to 295MW of storage co-located with 590MW of wind generation. Similarly, solar PV combined with 4-hour storage would require 285MW of energy storage alongside 570MW of solar. The most efficient configuration examined involves a combination of wind, solar and 4-hour storage, requiring 280MW of storage, 555MW of wind and 140MW of solar.

    "full_text": "Three companies, Energy Vault, Richardson Electronics, and Fluence, have made strategic moves to create a secure BESS equipment supply chain. Energy Vault is partnering with Turkey’s Astor Enerji, Richardson is expanding in Illinois, and Fluence is manufacturing HVAC and chiller equipment in Texas. These moves followEnergy-Storage.news’last roundup, which sawthree companies announce plans to begin domestically manufacturing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells in the US. US grid-scale energy storage solutions provider Energy Vault and Turkey-based transformer manufacturer Astor Enerji have signed a global strategic agreement to strengthen global supply chains for battery energy storage systems (BESS). The agreement will see Energy Vault supplying its B-Vault BESS for Astor Enerji’s four grid-connected PV projects in Romania, for a combined capacity of 2GWh. The projects will also utilise the company’s energy management system (EMS), VaultOS. Astor Enerji, meanwhile, will provide transformers and high-voltage equipment for more than 1GW of Energy Vault BESS projects in the US, Australia and Europe. Energy Vault notes that US transformer wait times have stretched from 50 weeks to as long as 127 weeks, emphasising that the agreement with Astor Enrji will provide the company with access to high-quality equipment from a non-foreign entity of concern (FEOC) designated nation. Energy Vault’s BESS projects are being developed and operated through its wholly owned subsidiary, Asset Vault, which is backed by a US$300 million preferred equity investment announced on 7 August. The supply chain of transformers has been tightening for some time. At the 2023 RE+ trade show in Las Vegas,system integrators and engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractors shared how lead times for the equipment had extended from 12 months to 32-36 months, plus time for the procurement cycle. Energy Vault has also been active in development,closing a US$18 million financing in July for its 57MW/114MWh Cross Trails BESS in Scurry County, Texas. Later this quarter, the company expects to receive over US$12 million in investment tax credit (ITC) funds as part of a previously agreed ITC sale agreement. Marco Terruzzin, Chief Revenue Officer at Energy Vault, said of the partnership with Astor Enerji, “Together, we are building the technology and supply chain capacity to meet surging power demand from AI data centres and the rapid adoption of renewable energy. This is how we deliver power abundance and economic growth on a global scale.” Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) and Richardson Electronics announced on 20 August that Richardson will expand its manufacturing headquarters in La Fox, Illinois. Richardson manufactures green energy products, power and grid and microwave tubes and more. With the support of the Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois (REV Illinois) programme, the company will make a capital investment of more than US$8.5 million over the next four years. Richardson Electronics will invest in equipment and structural upgrades in order to research, develop, and produce BESS at the company’s manufacturing facility. Notably, Richardson says its technology will demonstrate the viability of long-duration energy storage (LDES), and is being developed for manufacturing, healthcare and critical infrastructure operations. The company also says it will retain approximately 200 employees and create 54 full-time jobs. Richardson Electronics received a REV Illinois tax credit as part of the State’s incentive package, recognising the company’s capital investment and commitment to job creation. The agreement also outlines the retention of 190 jobs throughout the entire agreement period. In 2023, Pritzker welcomed Gotion High-Tech, a China-headquartered manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries, to the state. The company is establishing a split production facility in Illinois. In March of this year, Illinois State Senator Bill Cunningham and Representative Marcus Evans introduced a bill, HB3758, to reduce energy bills and set a 15GW energy storage deployment target. HB3758 shares many similarities with Senate Bill 3997 (SB3997),introduced by Cunningham in January, which aimed to accelerate energy storage in Illinois. Both bills seem to be at a standstill. SB3997 was adjourned without a set meeting date in January, and HB3758 was re-referred to the rules committee in March. BESS integrator Fluence, in partnership with climate control specialist Bergstrom, has started production of thermal management systems, including HVAC and chiller equipment, at a new manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas. The HVAC and chiller equipment will be used for Fluence’s Gridstack Pro BESS solution. Fluence says the Houston facility “plays a crucial role in the company’s strategy to onshore production of every major product and component of a grid-BESS to the United States.” While increasing US manufacturing of BESS materials has been an ongoing goal for some time, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) andForeign Entity of Concern (FEOC)requirements have made it an ever-present issue for companies like Fluence. As per the company’s statement, it utilises five manufacturing facilities in partnership with US-based manufacturers to produce a range of products, including battery cells, modules, inverters, enclosures, and control equipment. These collaborations account for over 1,200 manufacturing jobs in 2025. As reported yesterday (21 August), byEnergy-Storage.news,Fluence, along with ACE Engineering, just opened a new automated battery storage manufacturing facility in Vietnam’s Bac Giang Province. Fluence’s new facility has an annual manufacturing capacity of 35GWh, producing Gridstack Pro and Smartstack energy storage systems using fully automated production processes. This follows other companies, such as Chinese battery and BESS manufacturer, CATL, moving manufacturing capacity to Southeast Asia.CATL broke ground on its battery manufacturing facility in West Java, Indonesia, in July. Fluencealso recently shared its financial results for Q3 2025, reporting a quarterly revenue of US$602.5 million, up 24.7% year-on-year from US$483 million. According to the company’s latest results, delays in ramping up domestic manufacturing capabilities will push back the generation of approximately US$100 million in revenue until early next year. The company stated it experienced “some typical ramp-up issues” putting in place its Arizona production lines. Speaking on the Houston facility, Peter Williams, Fluence’s Chief Product and Supply Chain Officer, said, “This expansion helps accelerate our progress toward increasing US-based production and strengthening a resilient supply chain, and we believe it positions us to maximise domestic content in the solutions we deliver.”",

    "full_text": "Spanish utility Iberdrola and power conversion specialist firm Ingeteam have partnered to hybridise Spanish operational PV plants with battery energy storage systems (BESS). In total, four solar PV plants – in the provinces of Burgos, Huelva and the autonomous region of Extremadura – will be co-located with BESS with a total of 100MW/200MWh. Each project will consist of five medium-voltage stations that manage 25MW/50MWh BESS. The aim of hybridising BESS at the operational solar PV plants is to improve the management of the renewable energy. The storage systems supplied by Ingeteam include a proprietary hybrid power plant controller (H-PPC) coordinated with the PV plant and combines and limits the power delivered at the point of connection. Moreover, Ingeteam will supply its medium-voltage power electronics solution, control electronics, and SCADA monitoring system, which will manage the PV plants along with the new BESS plants. According to Ingeteam, the projects were awarded more than €26 million (US$30 million) in funding from the Spanish Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (IDAE), as they were recognised as Strategic Projects for Economic Recovery and Transformation (PERTE). These projectscould be part of the up to 150MW/300MWh BESS expected to be co-located with solar PVthat the utility secured funding for last year from the PERTE tender. Co-locating BESS with solar PV and renewable energy in general has become a priority in Spain after the countrywas affected by a blackout in Aprilof this year, as covered by our sister-sitePV Tech. Two months after the event, the government had approved – through a royal-decree subject to a vote in the Congress of Deputies – several measures to improve the country’s grid, including a faster administrative process to hybridise energy storage with renewables. Although the reformsended up being rejected by the Spanish Congressof Deputies last month, the Spanish government proposed a new royal decree that still aims to facilitate the co-location of BESS with renewables. A broader coverage of the Iberian blackout and its impact on solar PV was featured in the latest edition of our journalPV Tech Power, which isavailable herefor our Premium subscribers. Spain’s National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) targets around 22.5GW of energy storage by 2030, and interest in the technology has been growing in recent months. The Spanish Ministry of Environmentlaunched a financial support scheme for energy storagein June of this year, aimed at supporting the development of up to 3.5GW of projects. A total of €700 million (US$812 million) is available in the form of capex grants. “Spain is one of the most promising markets for the development of energy storage in Europe. The combination of PV with BESS not only allows for the optimal use of clean energy, but also improves the security and stability of supply,” said Katarzyna Suchcicka, VP of the management board at independent power producer R.Power, which has a BESS project portfolio of 344MW in Spain, of which 222MW are in standalone installations. More recently, thefirst solar-plus-storage power purchase agreement (PPA) in Spainwas signed between Spanish energy firm Zelestra and Portuguese utility EDP. Zelestra will build a 170MWp/400MWh solar-plus-project in the western region of Extremadura. This is not the first collaboration between Ingeteam and Iberdrola, as both companies previously partnered in the hybridisation of renewable energies with BESS, including the installation of the first BESS with an operational wind farm in Spain, said Ingeteam. The companies also collaborated in a green hydrogen project in 2022, with Ingeteamsupplying BESS for the Puertollano facility.",

    "full_text": "State-owned utility Western Power has commissioned five new community batteries in Perth suburbs as part of a federally funded initiative in Western Australia. The organisation confirmed that five community battery energy storage systems (BESS), each 500kW/2,800kWh, have been installed in the suburbs of Coogee, Kinross, Bayswater, Stratton and Port Kennedy. The Coogee community BESS is already operational, whilst Kinross, Bayswater and Stratton will be operational “shortly”. Construction at Port Kennedy is expected to begin shortly. These will service approximately 350 households, including renters and apartment dwellers who typically cannot install rooftop solar PV and storage systems. Connected households can save up to AU$132 (US$84) annually, together with a 4kWh off-peak offset under a retail subscription product being developed by Synergy, another state-owned energy company, for release later in the year. The lithium-ion battery systems are connected directly to the local distribution network, allowing them to store excess solar energy generated by households in each neighbourhood. This stored energy can then be discharged during peak demand periods, providing multiple benefits to both the grid and local residents. Western Power selected the five locations based on several factors, including the concentration of rooftop solar installations in each area and specific network requirements. The organisation added that the placement of these batteries aims to maximise their effectiveness in addressing local grid constraints while providing energy storage access to the greatest number of households. Sam Barbaro, CEO of Western Power, took to LinkedIn to celebrate the launch of the new community batteries, stating they are a “win-win for Western Power and customers.” “Currently, 40% of homes in the Western Power network have rooftop solar, and projects like this will enable a higher uptake of rooftop solar in a sustainable way that supports system security and manages infrastructure costs,” Barbaro added. Western Power confirmed the initiative received AU$2.5 million in funding through thefederal government’s AU$200 million Community Batteries for Household Solar programme, which aims to install 400 community batteries nationwide to provide shared storage for households across Australia. In addition to the federal government’s community battery programme, the federal government has invested AU$20.8 million in Project Jupiter, which aims to help Western Australian households benefit from Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). The Western Australian state government, led by Premier Roger Cook, has also launched complementary initiatives, including theWA Residential Battery Schemethat opened in July 2025. This scheme combines the AU$337 million WA Household Battery Rebate with the federal government’sAU$2.3 billion Cheaper Home Batteries programmeto support 100,000 households installing residential battery systems. The five new installations add to Western Power’s growing portfolio of community batteries across the South West Interconnected System (SWIS). The utility has been at the forefront of community battery deployment in Australia, beginning with its first PowerBank trial in Meadow Springs, which launched in 2018 and featured a 105kW/420kWh BESS.

    "full_text": "What does Trump’s tax reconciliation bill mean for US solar and BESS project development and construction right now? We hear from developer-operator Agilitas Energy CEO Barrett Bilotta. The firm is primarily known for distributed solar and battery energy storage system (BESS) projects in the Northeastern US butrecently commissioned its first BESS in Texas, part of asix-project portfolio acquired in 2023. It’s a highly uncertain time for those deploying solar, BESS and other clean energy technologies in the US.Trump’s tax reconciliation bill (OBBB)brought in an early end to tax credits for solar and wind. While it left energy storage tax credit timelines largely the same,still-to-be-clarified foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions on technology procurementsignificantly increase the risk of buying from China. Bilotta explained that the uncertainty created byTrump’s China tariffs, for which another 90-day truce was announced this week, and FEOC restrictions on technology creates challenges for procurement and progressing projects, but not an insurmountable one. “We have a lot of projects and assets that are near-term/starting construction so we feel pretty comfortable about those assets making it through the window put in by OBBB,” Bilotta said. “As an industry there are now a lot of problems for greenfield development, primarily because a bunch of the economics worked when you had tax credits for further-out projects: taking away that tax credit puts things into flux.” “As an industry, it will still go ahead and continue, but it will reset a bunch of programmes, increase electricity prices, or something else that will make things pencil out. A lot of that will boil down to higher PPA pricing for offtakers.” “There will be cost compression, because there will be less demand for construction and less demand for modules and inverters, so pricing will come down on supply side to move components.” “Everything that was a threshold project will be scrapped.” The future of BESS is closely tied to the future of solar and wind, whose variable generation is the primary demand driver for the flexibility and load-shifting services BESS generates much of its revenue from. Bilotta points to the past history of solar as a cause for optimism despite the OBBB’s early sunset of tax credits. “The market will mature more. The first maturation with solar happened with interest rates increasing after the zero-rate phenomenon. Solar suddenly needed to make the numbers work with real interest rates,” he said. “Solar projects will work but there’ll be a rejigging of the market, with states changing the types of direct subsidies, PPA buyers paying more etc.” The big question mark for energy storage is the FEOC component. For any project that didn’t start construction before 2025, tax credits will be denied if they rely too heavily on equipment from China. The same will happen if they depend on Chinese investments, pay Chinese counterparts via contracts of technology licenses. That’s a problem because most of the supply chain for batteries and BESS is in China. The US Treasury was scheduled to provide guidance on FEOC rules by 18 August. Many had doubted it would happen within that time frame, and the industry still awaits the guidance with baited breath. “From the energy storage side, we’re now just awaiting FEOC guidelines,” Bilotta said. “Our EPC team is dealing with a variety of manufacturers, switching around manufacturers. Now, if you are going to develop-build, you really need in-house expertise; you have to know what equipment works.” “We are trying to make the most rigid standard as it relates to compliance with FEOC, to meet that standard with those assets.” “If just one component is from a friendly nation like South Korea, will that hit threshold? If you buy an integrated system like Sungrow, it sounds like that wont qualify unless they totally shift their supply chain. All we can do is triage the risk.” It’s well-understood how you build solar with domestic procurement, but not so for clear for BESS which has much less capacity, Bilotta said. “Some might have more confidence about that capacity. We as a company don’t have the time pressure to make a decision. That is a luxury; others have live bullets flying.” One silver lining of all this for energy storage Barett sees is that the economic case for it may actually get stronger. We said earlier that the future of energy storage is closely tied to wind and solar, but Bilotta posits on the other hand that a slowdown in their deployment could converge with continued electricity demand growth to increase the need for energy storage. “Big energy users, states, businesses, all these things will require more energy services. The revenue side of the equation will change,” Bilotta said. “But this will depend on the buildout of EV charging and data centres.” We also discussed the company’s recent move into hydropower, with the acquisition of projects in West Virginia and Maryland totalling 44MW from Advanced Hydro Solutions, expected to be operational on the PJM grid by 2028. “We’ve been looking at hydro as an asset class for a while and the sector got a big shot in the arm with the IRA extending the tax credits to it,” Bilotta said. “Both projects get a 50% tax credit.” “There’s a huge demand for power, especially baseload, and it’s a stable asset so attractive for utilities and data centres. These projects are on federally-owned dams so that reduces the risk substantially.” “Construction is very different to solar and wind. You’re working on existing operational dams which are much more complicated. The actual units and turbines are a relatively small cost, most of the cost is building the pumphouse, temporary dams. We self-perform EPC for solar and storage, but for this we’d hire a large-scale experienced general contractor.”",

    "full_text": "Statera Energy has begun operating the biggest BESS project in the UK, connected to a National Grid substation that formerly supported two coal power plants. The developer announced earlier this week (18 August) that its 300MW/600MWh Thurrock Storage battery energy storage system (BESS) project in Essex, Southeast England, is delivering energy to the grid. Originally planned as a 1-hour duration project, the 2-hour BESS asset is part of Thurrock Flexible Generation, a complex that will also feature a co-located 450MW flexible generation gas-fired thermal power plant. National Grid connected Thurrock Storage to its Tilbury substation just south of the project site, noting that the transmission infrastructure formerly served to connect the now-retired Tilbury A and Tilbury B coal-fired power plants to the grid. National Grid said work is underway to connect the site’s gas-fired generation to the grid. Statera claimed the combination of batteries and gas generation at one site enables Thurrock Flexible Generation to respond to fluctuations in supply and demand created by the addition of solar PV and wind for extended periods of shortfall. Statera specialises in flexible energy resources that can play a role in the low-carbon grid alongside renewables, claiming to have more than 2.1GW of projects in the UK already delivered or in construction, plus a further 16GW in development or consented, comprising batteries, pumped hydro energy storage (PHES), hydrogen and flexible generation technologies. Statera’s claim that Thurrock Storage is the UK’s largest operational BESS facility rings true. However, several projects are in construction or development, which will likely take over the unofficial title soon. These include a number by Statera itself. In fact, according to Solar Media Market Research analyst Josh Cornes, whose team publishes theBattery Storage: UK Pipeline & Completed Assets Database, with Thurrock Storage now online, three out of the six largest grid-scale battery storage projects in the UK have been built by the developer. Before Thurrock Storage, the largest to date in the country was developer-investorZenobe Energy’s Blackhillock 200MW/400MWh grid-forming BESS, between Inverness and Aberdeen in Scotland, announced as operational in February, Cornes said. Looking further ahead, four 1GW or larger UK projects with planning approval in place are awaiting construction, including the 1.4GW Thorpe Marsh project by Onpath Energy, approved in January 2025, Innova’s 1,025MW Almhome Energy Hub, and others. Cornes also confirmed that with no other significant renewable or flexibility resources connected at the Tilbury substation, but with 800MW of solar PV operational near the Essex site with 1.7GW under construction or at the ready-to-build stage, Statera’s claim of picking a strategically significant location also rings true.

    "full_text": "Developer ACE Power has confirmed the sale of the 103MW/206MWh Kerang grid-forming battery energy storage system (BESS) in the Loddon Valley region of Victoria, Australia. ACE Power described the BESS as a ready-to-build development. It confirmed it has been sold to Banpu Energy Australia, a subsidiary of the Thailand-based energy firm Banpu Public Company. Banpu recentlysecured a 50% share in EnergyAustralia’s 350MW/1,400MWh Wooreen BESSbeing built within the Latrobe Valley, Victoria, in part to replace EnergyAustralia’s 1,450MW Yallourn coal-fired power station, which is scheduled for retirement in mid-2028. According to ACE Power, the Kerang project is among the earliest batteries nationwide to receive approval from AEMO to operate in grid-forming mode from the date of commissioning. Construction of the Kerang BESS is expected to commence in 2025, with commissioning to follow. Once commissioned, the battery is expected to have an operational lifespan of approximately 15-20 years, with potential for component replacement to extend its useful life further. ACE Power founder and managing director, Andy Scullion, hailed the use of grid-forming inverters in the Kerang BESS. “Using grid-forming inverter technology, Kerang BESS will provide stronger support to the Victorian electricity network by boosting system strength and resilience. This will also unlock additional capacity for other renewable energy technologies such as solar and wind to come online,” Scullion said. Grid-forming BESS differs from traditional battery storage systems in its ability to actively stabilise the grid by mimicking the behaviour of synchronous generators. These systems are designed to support thegrid’s operational continuity and ensure uninterrupted power supply, even during grid outages. They often set their own internal voltage waveform reference and can synchronise with the grid or operate independently of other generation sources. This makes them ideal for maintaining system strength in a renewables-dominated grid. One key aspect of a grid-forming BESS is its ability to provide synthetic inertia to maintain the grid’s frequency. Coal, gas, and hydropower plants have traditionally provided this inertia to the grid. However, with the impending withdrawal of coal-fired power, attention has been diverted to emerging technologies that could replace this, such as grid-forming battery storage or synchronous condensers. Interest ingrid-forming invertershas continued to grow in Australia. This recently saw Fluence’s Rob Hills, APAC vice president of engineering and commissioning, and Sam Markham, growth manager, Australia and New Zealand,deem the technology a trend in the NEM for the foreseeable future. Tesla’s head of business development and sales, Megapack APAC, Shane Bannister, said last month at the Clean Energy Council’s Australian Clean Energy Summit 2025 in Sydney that “I don’t think we’re [Tesla] going to sell another battery in Australia that’s not grid-forming.” Examples of grid-forming BESS in Australia include the likes of French independent power producer (IPP)Neoen’s 540MWh Western Downs stage one BESS in Queensland, Australian energy majorAGL Energy’s 2,000MWh Tomago BESS in New South Wales, and specialist infrastructure investorSosteneo’s 370MWh Koorangie BESS in Victoria. The topic is set to be explored at the upcomingBattery Asset Management Summit Australia 2025, which is set to take place on 26-27 August in Sydney next week. In other news, another renewable energy developer in Australia, Elgin Energy, has seen a 280MWh solar-plus-storage site in Victoria selected to be fast-tracked via the state government’s Development Facilitation Program. The Ballantine Solar Farm is being developed near Bairnsdale in the Gippsland region of Victoria. The project will combine an 85MW solar PV power plant with a 70MW/280MWh 4-hour duration BESS. The solar-plus-storage site will span approximately 117 hectares, with 99 hectares designated as developable area. The installation will feature around 118,000 ground-mounted solar modules on land currently used for agricultural activities, including cattle grazing. Victoria’s planning minister, Sonya Kilkenny, announced the project’s fast-tracking following extensive consultation with neighbouring properties and relevant government agencies, including the Country Fire Authority. “This approval reflects the ongoing success of the Development Facilitation Program – cutting red tape that will help cut down power bills faster,” Kilkenny said. The Development Facilitation Program, which was expanded last year to include renewable energy projects, aims to speed up the development of critical infrastructure projects in Victoria. Before its inclusion, projects had to pass through the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, which saw around 20% of these projects delayed by around two years. The initiative has been instrumental in expediting renewable energy projects. However, it’s worth noting that projects requiring an Environmental Effects Statement cannot use the Development Facilitation Program pathway. Over the past few months, the government has selected several BESS sites for inclusion in the scheme, including another site being pursued by Elgin Energy. For instance, in April 2025,Energy-Storage.newsreported thatElgin Energy’s 500MWh Barwon Solar Farm, a solar-plus-storage site, had been selected for the initiative. Developer Birdwood Energy saw a1.8GWh BESS fast-tracked by the governmentearlier this year via the Development Facilitation Program. In April 2024, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) acquired a majority stake in Elgin Energy, investing £250 million (US$336 million) to help the company deliver and expand its existing solar PV and battery portfolio across the UK, Australia, and Ireland. The Ballantine Solar Farm aligns with Victoria’s broader renewable energy targets and transition plans, which aim to achieve 95% renewable energy by 2035.",

    "full_text": "“It’s the most powerful battery energy storage system (BESS) in the world,” Nick Carter, CEO of Akaysha Energy, tellsESN Premiumfollowing the switching on of the 850MW/1,680MWh Waratah Super Battery in New South Wales, Australia. The claim made by Akaysha Energy, which had been acquired by global investment powerhouse BlackRock in 2022, refers to the power output of the battery storage system. As reported byEnergy-Storage.newsat the start of the month, theWaratah Super Battery started partial operations with the first 350MW/700MWh coming online, ahead of full operation later this year. Carter explains that this represents the largest connection point across Australia’sNational Electricity Market (NEM), which spans its eastern and southern states. However, several challenges have been encountered in building a BESS of this size, including the operationality of theSystem Integrity Protection Scheme (SIPS)with transmission operator Transgrid. “Enabling that first half of the SIPS has been a massive amount of work. On the face of it, the SIPS seems very simple in terms of what it’s doing, where we get a signal from Transgrid to ramp up generation,” Carter says. “That all sounds straightforward, but the actual implementation of it, and doing it at the speed at which we need to do it, in conjunction with the grid connection, in conjunction with the control system, across 288 inverters at a massive site, is really, really hard for a single connection point. That’s been massively challenging, so getting it to this point has been a huge win for us.” The SIPS contract for the Waratah Super Battery is widely recognised as the largest of its kind in Australia. It enables Transgrid to send signals to the BESS to inject energy into the grid while simultaneously instructing paired generators to adjust their output. Specifically, the SIPS Control System can monitor 36 transmission lines in real time and respond instantaneously to system events. This dynamic balancing act prevents disruptions and allows existing transmission infrastructure to operate at higher capacities, effectively “running harder” without compromising reliability. The Waratah Super Battery will also serve as a stopgap measure through the SIPS until the Hunter Transmission Project – a major infrastructure initiative to connect inland REZ to the rest of New South Wales – comes online. This major infrastructure project will see the construction of a new overhead 500kV transmission line spanning around 100km between Bayswater in the Upper Hunter and Olney in the Lower Hunter. It is hoped that this project will be completed by early 2028. In the meantime, the Waratah Super Battery will also play a role in stabilising the grid and reducing wholesale electricity prices by discharging energy during periods of high demand. One of the biggest challenges Akaysha Energy faced in developing the Waratah Super Battery was the bankruptcy of US-headquartered battery storage system integrator Powin Energy. In May 2025, the organisationfiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcyafter admitting itstruggled to compete with Chinese OEMs’ integrated BESS offerings. One of the biggest concerns surrounding the Waratah Super Battery at the time was how this could impact the development of the utility-scale project and what implications the situation would have. This was hot on the mind of Carter and the Akaysha Energy team when delivering the BESS site; however, Carter notes that the situation has gone “incredibly smoothly” so far. “Having Powin go bankrupt halfway through the commissioning process was not optimal, but we managed to get out of jail on that, and the whole thing has gone incredibly smoothly at the moment,” Carter tellsESN Premium. Over the years, Powin secured several contracts with Akaysha Energy in Australia, namely the Waratah Super Battery and the 300MWh Ulinda Park site in Queensland. Danny Lu, Powin’s executive vice-president,expressed the organisation’s excitement in branching deeper into the Australian BESS market toEnergy-Storage.newsin 2023. Powin began as a developer of battery energy storage system (BESS) projects and pivoted towards system integration and assembly, buying cells from multiple sources to put into its two BESS hardware solutions, Powin Pod and Centipede, integrated with its StackOS energy management system (EMS) and controls platform software. The company statement alluded to uncertaintiesover levels of US import tariffsand thefuture of tax credit incentivesas industry headwinds.Powin’s publicly disclosed battery cell suppliers, CATL, EVE Energy, REPT Battero and Hithium are based in China, while its sole US-headquartered supplier, KORE Power, is also still manufacturing in or importing from China aftercancelling plans for a gigafactory in Arizona. A couple of months ago, as Powin warned of layoffs and the potential cessation of business activities ahead, Carter revealed via LinkedIn that Akaysha had hired a number of key staff from the system integrator. This week, the deal for another US-based system integrator, FlexGen, to buy most of Powin’s assets was completed afterapproval by the US Bankruptcy Court in New Jersey. FlexGen CEO Kelcy Pegler toldESN Premiumlast week that one motivation for the deal was to“provide continuity” to Powin customers’ assets in the field. Another key discussion point with Carter centred around grid-forming inverters and how Australia could potentially be a leader in the use of this technology, owing to the amount of renewables already connected to its grids. As previously reported byEnergy-Storage.news, in 2023, AEMO introduced system strength measures, where all new storage needs to be grid-forming to be interconnected to the grid without a large penalty. As such, many projects in Australia today are being delivered with grid-forming capabilities. Indeed, Tesla’s head of business development and sales, Megapack APAC, Shane Bannister, said last month at the Clean Energy Council’s Australian Clean Energy Summit 2025 in Sydney that “I don’t think we’re [Tesla] going to sell another battery in Australia that’s not grid-forming.” Talking withESN Premium, Carter hints that the Waratah Super Battery could technically provide grid-forming abilities thanks to components provided by Sungrow and Hitachi. “When we look at Sungrow, which is a supplier, we’re using their grid-forming technology, andthe Hitachi PCS that we’re using on Waratah and Ulindaare capable of doing it. But at the moment, they’re grid-following,” Carter says. “They’re the last projects, I think, in the NEM that will be grid-following. Every other project we’re doing is grid forming.” Interest ingrid-forming invertershas continued to grow in Australia. This recently saw Fluence’s Rob Hills, APAC vice president of engineering and commissioning, and Sam Markham, growth manager, Australia and New Zealand,deem the technology a trend in the NEM for the foreseeable future. The topic is set to be explored at the upcomingBattery Asset Management Summit Australia 2025, which is set to take place on 26-27 August in Sydney next week.

    "full_text": "Global energy storage technology and energy software services provider Fluence and ACE Engineering have opened a new automated battery storage manufacturing facility in Vietnam’s Bac Giang Province. The facility, which boasts an annual manufacturing capacity of 35GWh, will produce Fluence’s Gridstack Pro and Smartstack energy storage systems using fully automated production processes designed to enhance productivity and quality control. The organisations said it will significantly expand Fluence’s production capacity for grid-scale energy storage systems amid growing global demand for battery storage solutions. For perspective, this single facility could produce enough storage systems to deploy roughly 8.75GW of 4-hour duration battery storage systems annually. Fluence confirmed that the facility will manufacture its Gridstack Pro and Smartstack product lines, representing the company’s latest generation of grid-scale storage solutions. Gridstack Pro is Fluence’sflagship large-scale front-of-the-meter storage system, designed for utility and independent power producer applications. The system features enhanced safety certifications, including UL9540 and UL9540A compliance, and is engineered for deployment in capacity-constrained areas of transmission networks. Smartstack, meanwhile,targets commercial and industrial applicationswith a more compact footprint and integrated energy management capabilities. According to Julian Nebreda, president and CEO of Fluence, the new facility will help provide the “next level of manufacturing excellence.” “By combining advanced automation with rigorous quality standards, we believe we are optimally situated to meet stringent customer requirements and deliver competitively at the speed and scale the market demands,” Nebrada said. Fluence recently released itsfinancial resultsfor the third quarter of its financial year, ending 30 June 2025. Its quarterly revenue stood at US$602.5 million, up 24.7% year-on-year from US$483 million. However, the organisation is on course to hit the lower end of its previously issued revenue guidance for the 2025 financial year due to delays in ramping up at US production sites. In the2024 rankings of global BESS system integrators by shipmentsreleased earlier this month by market research firm Wood Mackenzie, Fluence lost its position in the top five, having placedsecond for 2022andthird in 2023. Fluence’s development pipeline is mostly located in the Americas and much of that in the US. Company leadership said thatprojects that had been put on hold last quarter due to policy uncertaintywere starting to move again. As previously reported byEnergy-Storage.news, the US market accounts for around half of Fluence’s business. In addition to sourcing cells from AESC’s factory in Tennessee, the company has built a module factory in Utah, a component factory in Texas, and aBESS enclosure assembly plant in Arizona. However, the company has ties to several international regions, including Australasia and Southeast Asia. With growing interest in energy storage technologies and manufacturing capacity in Southeast Asia, Fluence opened the manufacturing plant in Thailand to capture this budding market. Several other energy storage companies have turned their attention to Southeast Asia to expand their manufacturing capacity. One of the most noteworthy is CATL, a Chinese battery and BESS manufacturer, whichbroke ground on the US$6 billion Indonesia Battery Integration Project in July 2025. CATL claims the project will span the “full battery value chain ” and involve multiple sites involved in everything from nickel mining and processing, battery materials production, and recycling to a battery manufacturing facility with an initial annual production capacity of 6.9GWh. In January, REPT Battero, another Chinese Li-ion manufacturer, announced that it intends to build Indonesian Battery Factory,a gigafactory specialising in cells for BESS applications with 8GWh annual output. The government of Indonesia recently launched a programme to build 100GW of solar PV and 320GWh of BESS in the coming years, mostly through smaller projects in rural areas.

The scope of the new partnership, revealed yesterday on LinkedIn by the Chinese manufacturer, will see CATL deliver supply and integration services for three BESS projects ACEnergy is developing in Australia. This includes the Yanco project in New South Wales and the Joel Joel and Little River BESS projects in Victoria. CATL confirmed it would provide the design, supply, testing, commissioning, and integration of BESS, medium voltage power station (MVPS), inverters, power plant controller (PPC), energy management system (EMS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), ensuring full grid compliance and world-class safety and performance. The250MW/1,100MWh Yanco BESS, which will span an area of around eight hectares, will be located 5km south of Leeton, around 500km to the west of the state capital, Sydney. It will store energy generated from a nearby large-scale solar PV project and will cost around AU$250 million (US$160 million) to construct. Meanwhile, CATL will supply two BESS projects in Victoria. The250MW/1,000MWh Joel Joel BESS, which changed from the initial 350MW/700MWh, is being developed around 23km east of Stawell in Victoria’s Wimmera region, famed for being home to the Grampians National Park. Last year, the project was selected asone of the first BESS to be fast-tracked through Victoria’s new Development Facilitation Program. This initiative, which was expanded last year to include renewable energy projects, aims to speed up the development of critical infrastructure projects in Victoria. Before its inclusion, projects had to pass through the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, which saw around 20% of these projects delayed by around two years. The Joel Joel BESS will use grid-forming inverters to provide essential grid services, such as frequency regulation and peak load management, to ensure a stable electricity supply to the state. The other battery storage project that CATL is set to supply is the 350MW/770MWh Little River BESS, which was also selected to be fast-tracked via the Development Facilitation Program pathway. Little River is 44km southwest of Melbourne, the state capital. The BESS will be located on an 18-hectare land and connect directly to Ausnet’s existing 220kV network infrastructure. Each of these battery storage projects will connect to theNational Electricity Market (NEM), which spans Australia’s southern and eastern states, as well as the island state of Tasmania.

    "full_text": "US-based renewable energy developer National Renewable Solutions’ (NRS’) 140MWac solar energy and 50MW battery storage Shallow Basket Energy project is now operational. Shallow Basket is in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. The project provides power for the Jicarilla Apache Nation, municipalities, and electric cooperatives. Located on land owned by the Jicarilla Apache Nation, the project will benefit the nation through its wholesale power supply agreement with Guzman Energy. Shallow Basket Energy’s operations were marked with a grand opening event hosted by NRS. Officials from NRS, Jicarilla Apache Nation, Guzman Energy, Kit Carson Electric Cooperative (KCEC), and other organisations gathered to commemorate the project. The project uses Tesla’s Megapack 2XL units. NRL highlights using Tesla’s equipment leverages the US renewable energy supply chain because the units were manufactured in Lathrop, California. That said, Tesla won’t start using US-made lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells in its systemsuntil they start coming off the company’s production linelater this year, or until anas-yet unconfirmed supply deal with LG Energy Solutionfrom its Michigan cell plant kicks in in 2027. Tesla Megapacks and residential Powerwall systems for the North American market are currently being built in Lathropusing cells sourced from third-party suppliers from Asia. Albuquerque, New Mexico-based Gridworks completed construction of the project. Following the announcement of project financing in November 2024, NRS successfully refinanced the debt for Shallow Basket Energy with MUFG Bank, Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, New York Branch, Siemens Financial Services, and Zions Bancorporation, N.A., securing improved terms that NRS says will facilitate the company’s growth. New Mexico has been a proactive state in terms of BESS development. In 2023, the state’s Senate passed a bill mandating that investor-owned utilities have 2GW/7GWh of energy storage operational by 2034. Recently,the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC) approved PNM’s 2028 resource application, which increases solar and storage capacity. It includes 300MW of capacity via energy storage agreements (ESAs) for two 150MW standalone battery facilities and a 150MW solar and battery storage project (100MW solar, 50MW battery), to be owned and operated by PNM. In April,IPP Enlight Renewable Energy announced the financial close of the 128MW solar and 400MWh BESS Quail Ranch project in the state. Jicarilla Apache Nation President Adrian Notsinneh, said of the Shallow Basket project: “The Shallow Basket Energy Project represents more than just clean power—it’s a powerful step forward in the Jicarilla Apache Nation’s journey toward energy sovereignty and economic self-determination. By hosting this project on our land, we’re honouring our legacy of environmental stewardship while creating opportunities for our people and contributing to a more sustainable future for the region.”",

    "full_text": "Challenging times demand resilient energy solutions, and, as Long Duration Energy Storage Council (LDES Council) CEO Julia Souder argues, now is the moment for long-duration energy storage to become a key pillar of the energy transition. This is an extract of a feature article that originally appeared inVol.43 of PV Tech Power, Solar Media’s quarterly journal covering the solar and storage industries. Every edition includes ‘Storage & Smart Power’, a dedicated section contributed by the Energy-Storage.news team,and full access to upcoming issues as well as the 10-year back catalogue is included as part of a subscription toEnergy-Storage.news Premium. Flexibility and resilience aren’t optional—they’re essential. We’re in an era of energy complexity: record-high renewable deployment targets, surging demand from artificial intelligence and data centre growth, electrifying industries and increasing threats from climate extremes and geopolitical instability. In times like these, certain truths become increasingly clear in resilient and reliable energy systems: flexibility is power. Long-duration energy storage (LDES) is uniquely positioned to deliver both, yet today’s markets, policies, and investment mechanisms still fall short of enabling the scale we need, leaving energy systems at risk of losing critical societal and system-wide benefits. We must move swiftly to: Even though in the United States, policies are turning away support for renewables, a majority of governments around the world are racing to meet ambitious renewable energy targets – such as the 11TW of renewables by 2030 (IEA and IRENA). Now, post-COP29 and looking ahead to COP30, long-duration storage is receiving more attention alongside generation—most notably through global storage and grid infrastructure pledges. Other than pumped hydro storage, most of the new storage currently deployed is short-duration, designed for only minutes to a few hours of flexibility. That’s no longer enough. Short-duration energy storage is essential, but insufficient. For both thermal and electric grids, it falls short in these critical areas: • Limited duration: Can’t support multi-day or seasonal imbalances • Reduced system resilience: Fails to sustain energy access during extended outages or disruptions • Narrow applications: Optimised for daily balancing, but not for industrial decarbonisation, grid congestion relief or long-term backup We need complementary solutions that can store and dispatch energy over days, weeks, and seasons. This is where LDES steps in. LDES unlocks multiple revenue streams, decreases grid congestion, has a cross-sector impact and is a more efficient use of renewable energy. It’s more than a tool for utilities—it’s a system-wide enabler across industry, transport, buildings and fuels. The more we deploy and integrate these applications, the faster and cheaper our path to net zero becomes. LDES is not a single technology—it’s a family of solutions, including thermal, mechanical, electrochemical and chemical systems. What they share is a singular mission: to bridge the gap between variable supply and variable demand, over periods that short-duration batteries alone can’t economically or technically address. While many think of storage as simply saving electricity for later, LDES goes far beyond. What makes LDES a powerful solution is in how the stored power or heat is ultimately used, with applications often referred to as power-to-power, power-to-heat and power-to-X. Each pathway expands the role of LDES beyond the grid, unlocking flexibility across sectors. The impact of LDES expands beyond decarbonisation; it enables an affordable, secure and resilient energy system. LDES acts as the shock absorber and stabiliser for energy systems, such as firming renewables, shifting surplus energy, replacing fossil fuel peakers and enhancing grid resilience. And it’s not just theoretical, look at the map of projects in Figures 1 & 2. Globally, the LDES Council has tracked 360 projects, 43 of which are under construction, with the latest year of completion in 2032. There are hydro projects in LATAM, but not new pumped hydro storage. Focusing on the United States, not only are diverse applications of LDES in construction or being deployed, but also new gigawatt factories. LDES projects are already proving their worth, delivering value to grids, customers and communities, as many communities need LDES to strengthen their energy infrastructure as well as provide resilience. But this is just a handful of what is needed to scale. More needs to be done. To fully realise the LDES opportunity, governments, regulators and financial institutions must act on these priorities: Establish Clear market signals: • Set long-duration storage targets at national and regional levels • Ensure procurement mechanisms support duration diversity • Set a resource adequacy value for LDES 8+ hours • Include LDES in transmission, distribution, and reliability planning • Recognise LDES contributions to system resilience, inertia, and heat decarbonisation • Blend public and private capital, support new revenue stacks • Support early-stage deployment via loan guarantees, offtake models, and grants Celebrate and scale success stories: • Share case studies and best practices (e.g., Spain, Massachusetts, India) • Build trust with communities, utilities and investors Streamline permitting and build public trust • Simplify permitting for low-impact LDES projects • Engage local communities early • Embed LDES in just transition and workforce development plans LDES is an infrastructure necessity. The next five years are decisive. Regulatory inertia must give way to bold action because the crisis warrants action. Most importantly, the tools and talent exist. With the right policies, financing and deployment urgency, we can scale LDES technologies in time to deliver resilience, affordability and climate security. Without it, the clean energy transition risks faltering under its own ambition. The energy transition we are in is a once-in-a-century transformation. Missing this opportunity to scale long-duration energy storage, we risk higher costs, greater emissions and a less resilient grid and energy system, unable to meet the demands of a decarbonised world. But if we succeed, LDES becomes the quiet force that makes the transition work, delivering resilience, affordability and true climate security. Reaching the necessary amount of LDES by 2030 is a critical step to the much-needed energy system inflexion – and we have reached the horizon where fossil fuels are no longer needed for energy system security. We cannot afford to wait. The time to build the LDES marketplace isn’t someday—it’s now. Let’s move with the speed this moment demands, before the window closes and, with it, the future we still have the power to shape.

    "full_text": "Construction has begun in western Lithuania on a 30MW/60MWh grid-connected battery energy storage system (BESS) project using CATL equipment. Commencement of the project was announced toEnergy-Storage.newsyesterday (19 August) by energy infrastructure construction company DS1, which is headquartered in Lithuania with operations in numerous European countries. Chinese lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery OEM and BESS solutions manufacturer CATL will supply the battery storage equipment. DS1’s partner BL Energy has selected power conversion system (PCS) equipment from inverter manufacturer Power Electronics for the project. According to a local news report, the asset is being constructed near Telšiai, which is a small city about 270km northwest of the national capital Vilnius. DS1 claimed that the proximity of the 2-hour duration utility-scale battery storage system to its transmission connection point via an existing overhead 110kV line just 50 metres away will enable fast and efficient implementation of the project. Partner BL Energy is an Israel-headquartered energy services company that provides engineering, procurement and construction (EPC), project and construction management, and commissioning services across a range of technologies, including oil and gas, renewables and maritime energy. BL Energy has worked on over 1.5GWh of BESS projects internationally to date. DS1 said the partnership will enable the Lithuanian company to deliver turnkey BESS solutions for customers’ projects at home and abroad, leaning on BL Energy’s experience and technical knowledge. A DS1 spokesperson toldEnergy-Storage.newsthis morning that DS1 is an investor in the project near Telšiai, as well as serving as the general contractor responsible for its delivery. “This dual role reflects our broader strategy of being involved in both the execution and long-term value of energy infrastructure projects,” the spokesperson said. The company’s services arm, DS1 Services, will carry out the 30MW/60MWh site’s maintenance, including management of an on-site warehouse for spare parts and acting as the official representative to CATL and Power Electronics in Lithuania. DS1 Service maintains over 463MW of infrastructure in the country, including 348MW of wind generation across eight power plants. The announcement comes amid waves of energy storage development, financing activities and policy initiatives in Lithuania and its fellow Baltic States Estonia and Latvia. In July, theLithuanian government approved a €37 million (US$43 million) increase to a capex grant schemefor energy storage projects, adding to an existing €102 million made available for the scheme,which was approved in 2024and will come from European Union (EU) funding mechanisms. The country’s Ministry of Energy is aiming to oversee 1.5GW/4.4GWh of new energy storage deployments by 2028, andEnergy-Storage.newshas reported on numerous projects, such as utilityIgnitis Group’s 291MW/582MWh portfolio across three sitesinto which the company said last month that it would invest a total of around €130 million. Energy storage is being considered of strategic national importance to the three Baltic countries, particularly since thedisconnection of their grids from the BRELL grid shared with Russia and Belarusearlier this year. The grids are now synchronised with the continental European transmission system operator (TSO) territories. Ahead of the decoupling from Russia’s network, Lithuania’s own TSO, LitGrid, deployed a four-project portfolio of equally sized 50MW BESS assets in partnership with system integrator Fluence,located at strategic points on the grid to aid stability. EstoniaandLatviaare also seeing the buildout of energy storage begin to pick up pace, although so far on a lesser scale.",

    "full_text": "Commercial and industrial (C&I) energy storage can significantly lower electricity costs, increase efficiency, and aid decarbonisation, but customers’ safety concerns must be addressed. Global energy storage hit record highs in 2024, with nearly 1TWh of new capacity expected annually by 2035.China led with over 100GWh deployed, accounting for 62% of global additions, while the US and Europe each surpassed 10GWh, according to numbers from the China Energy Storage Alliance (CNESA), Wood Mackenzie, and Delta-EE, respectively. BloombergNEF forecasts a 14.7% CAGR through 2035, reaching 220GW/972GWh of annual additions. Regional trends vary: utility-scale projects dominate in the US, Europe leads in residential adoption, and commercial & industrial (C&I) storage is surging worldwide. C&I systems—often installed behind the meter—help reduce energy costs, integrate onsite renewables, and boost resilience. In Q2 2025, US C&I deployments rose 36%, while Europe added 2.2GWh last year. Challenges remain, from high upfront costs to recycling gaps, but technology continues to advance. As hardware, software, and safety measures improve, the industry is better positioned than ever to meet growing global demand. The critical safety risk for energy storage systems based on lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries is thermal runaway. It occurs when the heat generated exceeds the heat dissipated, resulting in rapidly rising temperatures. Thermal runaway can be caused by internal failure or external conditions. The good news is that the risk can be monitored, managed and minimised, including the threat of fire propagating, i.e., spreading, from one cell to its neighbours and into nearby enclosures and other equipment or structures. Although the frequency of battery storage incidents has dropped sharply, with a 97% decrease from 2018 to 2023 and only one fire per roughly 35GWh deployed, safety remains in the spotlight. New York and California are introducing stricter regulations, while the European Association for Storage of Energy (EASE) is calling for cross-border coordination on standards and fire safety best practices. The industry, meanwhile, has a responsibility to ensure that customers, communities, and local authorities can be certain that the systems deployed in their facilities or neighbourhoods are as safe as possible. Alongside managing and minimising risks, it must also educate those stakeholders on the progress made and the industry’s commitment to safety. C&I battery storage systems can often face challenging operating conditions, which can include elevated temperatures, exposure to dust and mechanical vibrations. They may often be installed alongside heavy industrial equipment. Any shortcomings in critical aspects of their complex system design, such as cell quality consistency, ventilation, thermal management and fire protection systems, can lead to potential safety hazards. During operation, continuous monitoring of battery state-of-health (SoH), voltage balancing is essential, as is ongoing assessment of component replacement needs. However, many energy storage systems available today fall short of mitigating the risks. Their shortcomings can be found in system and component-level design, cell warranties, fire protection features, energy management systems (EMS), and software strategies. For instance, C&I systems typically follow a centralised, cabinet-based design, integrating battery modules, power conversion system (PCS), battery management system (BMS), fire protection and thermal management components into a single cabinet. This integrated architecture has the disadvantage of placing all of the critical components within a single cabinet, which means the risk of a fire affecting them all is increased. There is also not enough space left between the placement of battery clusters in cabinet-based designs, which can enable the rapid spread of fire. Furthermore, fire suppression units are externally installed in cabinet-based designs, which limits their ability to quickly and effectively contain thermal incidents. They also often lack insulation between cells and metal enclosures, which can, over time, lead to short circuits and heat transfer as cell expansion causes direct contact. Other limitations of common designs include a reliance on three layers of software-based protection and a lack of hardware redundancy. That means that the power circuit is left unprotected in the event of a software failure. The system could continue operating under abnormal conditions, leading to component damage and the increased risk of safety incidents. New ways of thinking are emerging. Modular systems could mitigate or even eliminate the risks of fire spreading across an entire installation. Where cabinet-based designs with centralised fire protection and delayed response times can be vulnerable to propagation risk, modular systems can take design in a fundamentally different direction. Each battery pack can be equipped with its own fire protection system, with more layers of integrated safety features. C&I and utility-scale markets are also converging in the sense that medium—to large-scale C&I projects are more common, with output in megawatts rather than kilowatts. Greater modularity enables scaling up of project sizes tailored to the customer’s needs. Built to overcome the limitations of existing approaches, Sigenergy’s SigenStack features a modular, scalable design with six layers of integrated safety protection. SigenStack is designed specifically for C&I applications. It overcomes or mitigates safety challenges that battery storage systems could face due to design choices and conventions at the system level. For instance, SigenStack’s modular architecture includes independent fire protection for each 12kWh battery pack. The six layers of safety (sensors, active fire suppression modules, high-temperature insulation pads, thermal barriers, pressure relief valves and smoke detectors) enable close-range detection of thermal anomalies and rapid response. Whereas the typical ratio of temperature sensors to cells is about 8-12 sensors per 52-60 battery cells per cabinet in traditional designs, SigenStack features 8 full-coverage temperature sensors for every 12 cells, greatly improving the comprehensiveness and accuracy of monitoring. Sigenergy has also innovated in pack design. Traditional solutions also do not use heat insulation pads between cells, which allows for more heat transfer between them. The battery pack in SigenStack features ultra-low thermal conductivity (<0.02 W/m·K) insulation pads between cells. This not only aids the flame-retardant, heat-insulating effects but also enhances electrical safety by providing relatively high impedance. Similarly, many current energy storage system designs do not include pressure relief valves, as SigenStack does. This one-way exhaust device can quickly release internal combustible gases that can build up when thermal runaway occurs, preventing a thermal event from escalating into an explosion. Each SigenStack battery pack, fitted with an integrated smoke detector, acts as an independent safety unit, enabling closer-range detection of thermal runaway and significantly enhancing response times versus the traditional cabinet-based system approach.",

    "full_text": "Long-term BESS offtake and PPA deals are clearly on the rise in Europe, but how are they evolving vis-à-vis structures, tenors and regional differences? Market intelligence firm Pexapark’s lead battery energy storage system (BESS) analyst Apostolis Valassas discussed the topic withEnergy-Storage.news Premium,following a series of reports the firm put out on it. Because of the sharp revenue falls in 2023, it has become more common for BESS project owners to enter into long-term offtake contract structures with counterparties to transfer risk in the UK/GB market. Meanwhile, long-term deals have been necessary in some other European regions to get markets off the ground, with investors less likely to fund merchant projects. “Germany is becoming a deal-making hotspot, now second after GB. We’ve seen deals totalling more than 700MWh in Germany in 2025 so far. We expect Germany to retain its current momentum,” Valassas says. “The Netherlands has the potential to become another deal-making hotspot, the trend there is a blend of contracted revenues with the asset ‘sliced’ into several tranches. I think this is a strategy to hedge against grid tariffs which are very high, but at the same time the spreads are very high, so it makes sense for the owner to retain some merchant exposure.” Indeed, ‘slicing’ BESS into several tranches to different offtakers is the strategy opted for by basically all the big BESS owner-operators in the Netherlands. We’ve interviewedSemperPowerandGiga Storageseparately about this, whileLion Storage has gone a slightly different route. Many countries are seeing their first ever BESS offtake deals announced recently too, including Bulgaria, Greece, Poland, to name a few, Valassas adds. Where different offtake structures are popular is becoming clearer too, he says. “In GB we see floors being more popular than tolls, while in Germany tolls seem to be the go-to option to make larger scale assets bankable.” And the length of the deals is increasing: “Across the board we are also seeing longer tenors. The volume weighted average tenor on the deals we’ve tracked is just over five years, but that will increase over time.” We then ask Valassas how the emergence of government-backed long-term revenue-providing schemes like capacity markets (CM) andItaly’s MACSE auctionmay affect the value of BESS offtake deals. Valassas says that the logic of how this worked in solar may not apply to BESS. “In the renewables space, government-backed subsidy schemes have tended to function in a competitive way against PPAs. I am not sure if we can apply the same thing to capacity markets or MACSE for BESS, since you can just stack them together.” A big discussion in Europe right now is around hybrid power purchase agreements (PPAs), where one offtaker contracts with a project owner for both the renewables (usually solar) generation and BESS portion of a hybrid project. This deal structure is relatively common in North and South America, but very rare in Europe. In fact,the first such deal in Spain was recently announcedby Spanish energy firm Zelestra and Portuguese utility EDP. Valassas expect more to come. “So far, the preference across co-located projects has been for a setup where each part has their own separate route-to-market: a PPA or subsidy for solar and separate optimisation for BESS. Hybrid PPAs where they share the same contract haven’t been that popular so far, but we expect this to change, especially where the business case for co-location is strong, like [in] Spain,” he says. “Eventually demand for straight solar profiles won’t be there, so the straightforward solution will be co-location with a hybrid PPA to offer a flattened solar profile. There are contractual complexities and regulatory and grid hurdles to it, but we expect it to take off in the next few years.”",

    "full_text": "The Australian government has officially launched its highly anticipated AU$500 million (US$323 million) Battery Breakthrough Initiative (BBI), aiming to help the nation become a major player in the global battery manufacturing sector. The programme, which is nowaccepting applications through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), represents one of the most substantial federal investments in battery manufacturing capability to date. Announced in theMay 2024 Federal Budgetand developed via industry consultation, the initiative offers Australian businesses access to capital grants and production incentives designed to address critical gaps in domestic manufacturing capability and scale. ARENA will manage the programme closely with the Department of Industry, Science and Resources, ensuring alignment with broader industrial policy objectives. The BBI stands as one of the critical pillars of the Albanese government’sNational Battery Strategyand the wider Future Made in Australia agenda, anAU$22.7 billion programme to invest in reindustrialising Australia with a focus on clean energy tech, including batteries, solar PV, electric vehicles (EVs), and hydrogen. “Batteries are a critical component of the global move to reduce carbon emissions, and there is a huge opportunity for Australia to be part of this global demand,” said the federal minister for industry and innovation, Tim Ayers, during Tuesday’s programme launch. “Australia’s got the raw materials, a strong research sector and a range of companies deeply engaged on the role of batteries in the clean energy transition, and that’s why I’m so excited to back these home-grown ideas and businesses to deliver a Future Made in Australia.” The initiative adopts a targeted approach to funding distribution, focusing on three strategic segments of the battery value chain where Australia possesses competitive advantages or critical capability gaps. These are noted as battery materials manufacturing, battery cell production and battery pack assembly. For materials manufacturing, the programme supports the processing and production of advanced battery materials utilising Australia’s abundant critical mineral resources, including lithium, nickel, cobalt, and graphite. In the battery cell production segment, the initiative aims to enable the establishment and expansion of cell manufacturing facilities to transform Australia from a component exporter to a producer of high-value battery cells. For battery pack assembly, the BBI facilitates the development of operations that can serve both domestic and export markets across stationary storage applications. ARENA will provide funding through various mechanisms tailored to project needs. This includes capital grants for infrastructure development, production incentives to support ongoing operations, and potentially other payment structures determined on a project-specific basis. The programme guidelines establish a streamlined approval pathway for projects seeking AU$50 million or less, which can receive direct approval from the ARENA Board. This mechanism aims to accelerate deployment for mid-sized manufacturing ventures while maintaining appropriate governance for larger investments. Accoridng to the Australian government, this positions the BBI as essential for enabling domestic manufacturers to achieve the scale and technological sophistication necessary to compete effectively in high-value segments of the battery market. It also noted that the programme aims to capitalise on Australia’s natural advantages by focusing on stationary energy storage applications and leveraging the country’s critical minerals and renewable energy resources. ARENA has established clear technical thresholds for project eligibility for the BBI. Technologies must demonstrate a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 or higher, indicating that core technologies must have already been validated in relevant environments. This requirement ensures that funding supports projects with realistic pathways to commercial deployment rather than early-stage research. Projects will be assessed on multiple criteria, including their potential contribution to domestic manufacturing capability, innovation merit, commercial viability, and alignment with broader policy objectives around clean energy transition and industrial development. The programme will remain open until the AU$500 million allocation is fully committed or until the government determines a closure date, creating an incentive for early application development while allowing sufficient time for complex manufacturing proposals to be prepared.

    "full_text": "Singaporean renewable energy developer Blueleaf Energy has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Chemsain Sustainability to jointly explore developing a portfolio of up to 3GW of solar PV and battery energy storage systems (BESS) in Malaysia. The agreement establishes a framework for collaboration over the next two years, focusing on utility-scale renewable energy development that aligns withMalaysia’s National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR)and Sarawak’s Post-COVID-19 Development Strategy (PCDS) 2030. According to the two companies, the MoU will explore the potential for constructing utility-scale solar PV and energy storage facilities in Sarawak, a Malaysian state on the island of Borneo. The island is also home to several Indonesian states, with the country developing its new capital, Nusantara, in the southeast. Brunei is the only sovereign state entirely on Borneo. Blueleaf Energy, a pan-Asian renewable energy platform owned by a fund managed by Macquarie Asset Management, will contribute its expertise in renewable energy development and financing. At the same time, Chemsain, a Malaysian sustainability advisory firm, will provide local regulatory knowledge and sustainability frameworks. Raghuram Natarajan, CEO of Blueleaf Energy, believes that the ambition to build 3GW of renewable energy in Sarawak demonstrates the region’s “immense potential”. “This MoU marks a significant milestone for Blueleaf Energy’s expansion in Southeast Asia and our commitment to supporting Malaysia’s National Energy Transition Roadmap,” said Natarajan. Malaysia has established renewable energy targets under its National Energy Transition Roadmap. It aims to increase renewable energy capacity to 31% by 2025 and 70% by 2050. This also includes expanding installed renewables capacity to 14GW. Meanwhile, the government also wants to see at least 500MW of BESS deployed by 2030 and continued growth after the decade’s end to support those policy goals. Sarawak, Malaysia’s largest state, has its own ambitious targets under the Post-COVID-19 Development Strategy 2030, which aims to achieve 60% to 70% renewable energy share by 2035. The state government has identified renewable energy as a key driver of economic growth and sustainability. It plans to position Sarawak as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ (ASEAN) future energy hub. It is worth noting that the scale of the proposed 3GW portfolio is ambitious for Malaysia and would represent one of the largest renewable energy commitments in Southeast Asia. For comparison, Malaysia’s total installed solar capacity stood at approximately 1.5GW at the end of 2024, according to the Malaysian Energy Commission. MSR-Green Energy (MSR-GE) is building another large-scale BESS project in Borneo, in the state of Sabah, located at island’s northeastern tip. The energy storage arm of Chinese solar PV inverter manufacturerSungrow signed a supply agreement to provide the 100MW/400MWh BESS for the projectlast year.

Благодаря высокой теплоёмкости расплавленная соль способна аккумулировать большое количество тепла в течение дня и сохранять его даже ночью. Затем накопленное тепло передаётся турбинам, которые вырабатывают электроэнергию, пишетEofruPikabu. Эта система обеспечивает энергией и освещением около 80 000 домов, демонстрируя эффективное использование возобновляемых источников энергии. Такой подход позволяет значительно снизить зависимость от ископаемого топлива и уменьшить выбросы парниковых газов, способствуя борьбе с изменением климата. Кроме того, технология аккумулирования тепла в расплавленной соли обеспечивает стабильное и непрерывное энергоснабжение, что является одним из главных преимуществ по сравнению с традиционными солнечными панелями, зависящими от наличия солнечного света.

    "full_text": "E²nergy — энергетика Евразии и мира Энергосбережение и развитие возобновляемых источников энергии являются одними из приоритетных задач в Узбекистане. Особое внимание уделяется обеспечению экологической устойчивости, а также повышению экономической эффективности путем реформирования сферы и внедрения инновационных технологий, пишетУзА. Акционерное общество «Узбекнефтегаз» также реализует ряд важных проектов в этом направлении. Вот что рассказал нам руководитель пресс-службы общества Мумин ИБОДОВ: – Государство поставило перед нами задачи по широкому внедрению возобновляемых источников энергии и повышению энергоэффективности. В результате строительства объектов возобновляемой энергии, внедрения современных технологий и энергосберегающего оборудования достигнуты важные результаты в обеспечении надлежащего использования энергетических ресурсов на наших предприятиях. Так, за 7 месяцев текущего года обществом сэкономлено 72,9 миллиона киловатт-часов электроэнергии и 34,48 миллиона кубометров природного газа. Эти показатели составляют 132 и 101,5 процента от намеченного плана. В целях обеспечения выполнения поручений Президента по энергосбережению и внедрению возобновляемых источников энергии в АО «Узбекнефтегаз» реализован ряд проектов. На предприятиях и в офисах установлены устройства компенсации частоты и реактивной мощности, энергосберегающие насосы, компрессоры и современные технологии. Также работают солнечная фотоэлектрическая установка мощностью 29,3 МВт, солнечные водонагреватели и освещение на основе солнечных панелей. Это позволило значительно сократить потребление электроэнергии. В настоящее время на Шуртанском газохимическом комплексе реализуется проект по производству электроэнергии из 48 тысяч кубометров отбросного газа. После выхода проекта на полную мощность комплекс будет вырабатывать 36,8 миллиона киловатт-часов электроэнергии и предотвратит выбросы 14 297 тонн Со2. В Газлийском нефтегазодобывающем управлении строится газопоршневая электростанция мощностью 7 МВт. За счет этого проекта будет вырабатываться 47 миллионов киловатт-часов электроэнергии. Также на предприятиях и в подразделениях системы внедряются модули накопления энергии BESS (Battery Energy Storage System) мощностью 95 МВт или 190 МВт·ч. Безусловно, в результате таких мер будут достигнуты экономия электроэнергии и топливных ресурсов, а также экологическая устойчивость. До конца текущего года планируется сэкономить 98,2 миллиона киловатт-часов электроэнергии и 72 миллиона кубометра природного газа. В заключение следует сказать, что реформы и инвестиционные проекты АО «Узбекнефтегаз» играют важную роль в экономии энергоресурсов и обеспечении экологической устойчивости. Новые технологии и модернизация производства вносят значительный вклад в развитие экономики Узбекистана и охрану окружающей среды.

    "full_text": "E²nergy — энергетика Евразии и мира Экстремальные климатические условия и удаленность арктических регионов от централизованных энергосетей требуют альтернативных решений в энергоснабжении. Традиционные методы неэффективные или дорогие, поэтому отрасль рассматривает возобновляемые источники энергии (ВИЭ), в частности, гидроэнергетику. Газета «Энергетика и промышленность России» разобрали альтернативные варианты энергоснабжения Арктики, пишетСибирский Новостной. Крайний Север богат водными ресурсами: только в Якутии насчитывается 700 тыс. рек, в Красноярском крае – 127 тыс. Их можно использовать для строительства малых ГЭС, которые выгоднее чем крупные объекты. В СССР таких станций было более 7000, но сегодня в России осталось лишь 102. «Из восьми арктических стран семь развивают малые ГЭС. Россия – единственная, кто этого не делает, ссылаясь на сложные климатические условия. Однако в Канаде, где температура опускается до –69°C, малые ГЭС дают 15 тыс. МВт», – отметил глава Национального агентства по энергосбережению и ВИЭ Николай Сафронов. Средний срок окупаемости таких проектов – около 5 лет. Среди перспективных технологий: · резиновые плотины – легко монтируются и демонтируются; · капсульные ГЭС – работают подо льдом, не мешая судоходству. Однако в Арктике малые ГЭС могут функционировать лишь 5–6 месяцев в году, поэтому для их рентабельности необходима господдержка. Строительство крупных АЭС, ГЭС и ТЭЦ в Арктике нерентабельно из-за сложностей с распределением энергии. Выход – локальная генерация, но она требует системной поддержки государства. По мнению руководителя направления по энергетике и ЖКХ Корпорации развития Дальнего Востока (КРДВ) Максима Губанова – «Необходимы льготное финансирование, долгосрочное планирование и эффективные бизнес-модели». Уже запущены пилотные проекты, которые в случае успеха можно масштабировать на другие удаленные территории. Российские компании создают уникальные решения для Арктики: · ГТД АА-2000 – компактный газотурбинный двигатель, работающий даже на угле. Его можно быстро доставить и установить без фундамента; · малые АЭС – саморегулируемые реакторы мощностью до 1 МВт (электричество) и 14 МВт (тепло). Сегодня многие северные населенные пункты зависят от дизельных электростанций (ДЭС), износ которых достигает 70%. Себестоимость энергии в Якутии иногда превышает 1000 руб./кВт·ч. Альтернативой может стать газомоторная генерация. ГМ ТЭЦ в Анадыре производит энергию по 10 руб./кВт·ч, используя местный газ. Однако без модернизации месторождения станция может закрыться уже через 2–3 года. E-mail:info@eenergy.mediaВеб-сайт:eenergy.mediaFacebook:eenergy.media",

Здесь может быть запущено до 100 малотоннажных заводов, в ближайшие 5–7 лет — с продукцией, которую покупает Европа уже сегодня: лиоцелл из конопли и льна, биотопливо из рапса и сорго, устойчивое авиационное топливо (SAF). Каждый такой завод — 200 стабильных рабочих мест для специалистов нового поколения, и возможность удержать до 5000 жителей и привлечь ещё до 1000. Это не гипотеза — это структурный ответ на вызовы Великого возвращения. Это новая модель коммуникации с ЕС, и Карабах — идеальная точка входа в эту модель, пишетИгорь Насиров, независимый эксперт, кандидат технических наук, на порталеFirst News Media. В июле 2025 года в Ханкенди прошёл 17-й саммит Организации экономического сотрудничества (ОЭС) — не просто дипломатическое событие, но поворотный момент: Карабах окончательно вышел за рамки зоны восстановления, превратившись в стратегическую платформу евразийской устойчивой индустриализации. Этот вектор не случаен. Карабах обладает пятью из одиннадцати мировых климатических зон и девяти климатических зон Азербайджана, что делает регион уникальным плацдармом для внедрения новых моделей индустрии, циркулярной экономики и общества. Восстановление это не возвращение к довоенному статус-кво, а возможность формирования новой индустриальной логики — низкоуглеродной, мультиотраслевой и инженерно-ориентированной. Стратегическая цель в год «Конституции и Суверенитета» — стабильный и качественный рост населения, рост ВВП и высококвалифицированного трудового потенциала региона. Фокус сдвигается от инфраструктуры к формированию устойчивого демографического и экономического развития. За гражданским строительством следуют налоговые стимулы, поддержка технопарков, локализация переработки, и продвижение производств, ориентированных на внутренний и экспортный рынок. Современная климатическая повестка уже перешла в разряд глобальной политической доктрины и стратегии. В то время как ЕС внедряет замкнутые модели производства, Азербайджан способен сформировать свою систему — через интеграцию биоресурсов и цепочек глубокой переработки. Центральным инструментом этой стратегии в регионе может выступить Вектор Центр-БИО (биоцентричный промышленный кластер), выстроенный на синергии возобновляемых источников энергии (ВИЭ) (Карабах официально объявлензоной«зелёной» энергии), глубокой переработке биоресурсов, водородных технологиях и локальных инженерных решениях. Среди ключевых направлений: волокно, биодизель и биоглицерин, устойчивое авиационное топливо (SAF), эфирные масла, природные смолы, биоэтанол, уксусная кислота, микроводоросли, биокрасители, витамины, кислоты, вакцины и бактериофаги. Благодаря зелёной электроэнергии продукция не только «био», но и углеродно-нейтральная. Одной из опор зелёной индустрии может стать лиоцелл (Lyocell) — биоразлагаемое целлюлозное волокно нового поколения. Он сочетает прочность синтетики с экологичностью натуральных материалов и уже признан ЕС в рамках Sustainable Product Policy Framework. Рост спроса в ЕС – 15-30 % в год. Lyocell способен заменить полиэстер, вискозу и нетканые материалы во множестве отраслей: от текстиля до медицины и упаковки. Лиоцелл идеален для вторичной переработки. Переход к устойчивому производству лиоцелла требует новой сырьевой стратегии, ориентированной на климатическую адаптацию и замкнутые циклы биомассы. Особую ценность представляет сырьё из хлопкового линтера с содержанием целлюлозы до 95%. Однако его дефицит диктуют необходимость создания альтернативной сырьевой базы. Ключевыми культурами выступают лён, конопля, рапс и сорго — мультифункциональные растения, совмещающие масличную и целлюлозную ценность. К ним примыкает Paulownia elongata, быстрорастущее дерево с высоким содержанием целлюлозы энергетической ценностью, признанное IRENA и UNIDO в числе ключевых ресурсов для биоэнергетики и климатоустойчивого земледелия и отлично подходящая для расширения «Парка наследия COP29» на территорию Карабаха. Paulownia является регулируемым инвазивным видом, контролируемым в странах ЕС и США, что требует использованию передовых технологий и применения лучших практик современных агропарков. Выбранные культуры демонстрируют устойчивость к засухам, высокую урожайность на маргинальных почвах и потенциал для глубокой переработки — от биотоплива и упаковки до фармацевтических ингредиентов и биотекстиля. Хеджируют усталость земель и изменения климата. Лён и конопля обладают наилучшими параметрами для производства лиоцелла. Сорго и рапс оптимальны для производства биодизеля, SAF, а также кормов и БАДов. Конопля, несмотря на регуляторные ограничения, при уровне ТГК ≤0.3 % уже исключена из-под действия Конвенции ООН 1961 года и признана UNODC безопасной для промышленного использования. Её включение в пилотные проекты в Азербайджане возможно в рамках обновлённой нормативной базы и уже существующего опыта агропарков, использующих технологии искусственного интеллекта, спутникового мониторинга и интернета вещей, что не только гарантирует максимальный урожай, но и исключает смешивание сортов и превышение ТГК. Формируется новая промышленная карта региона на основе синергии агропромышленного комплекса с глубокой переработкой агропродукции и легкой промышленностью: Развёртывание биоцентричной промышленной архитектуры на базе возобновляемого сырья, распределённых производств и зелёной энергетики позволяет рассматривать Карабах как ядро формирования новой евразийской модели устойчивого развития. Здесь сходятся три стратегические оси: — демографическая устойчивость. Ключевая особенность данной модели — мультифункциональность: биоэкономика становится одновременно экономической, социальной и демографической платформой.Каждый из 100 заводов создаёт по 200 прямых рабочих мест.При условии запуска10 заводов — минимум 2000 новых квалифицированных инженеров и технологовв течение 5-7 лет. По расчетной демографической модели,это позволит поддержать до 50 000 жителей и дополнительно привлечь около 10 000 в регион— за счёт занятости, образования и доступной инфраструктуры. Биоиндустрия формирует каркас новой социальной географии: появляются рабочие места для агрономов, химиков, операторов, биотехнологов, преподавателей и студентов.Формируются университетские кластеры, научные парки, программы стажировки, колледжи и лаборатории. Критическим элементом становится интеграция системы субсидий — как компенсации логистических и энергетических издержек для удалённых производств.Субсидии позволяют выровнять себестоимость с центральными регионами и запустить устойчивое ценообразование на продукцию глубокой переработки, задействовать транспортную инфраструктуру, включая аэропорты. Карабах превращается в ядро формирования нового класса — инженеров устойчивого будущего, ориентированного на синергию с природной средой, интеграцию в глобальные производственные цепочки и освоение ресурсной базы будущего. Обладая пятью из одиннадцати мировых климатических зон и девяти климатических зон Азербайджана, высокопродуктивной агроэкосистемой и доступом к зелёной энергии. На фундаменте пяти национальных приоритетов социально-экономического развития страны: 1. Стабильно растущая конкурентоспособная экономика; 2. Общество, основанное на динамичной, инклюзивной и социальной справедливости; 3. Конкурентоспособный человеческий капитал и пространство для современных инноваций; 4. Великое возвращение на освобожденные территории; 5. Чистая окружающая среда и страна «зеленого роста». Карабах может предложить евразийскую интеграцию принципов циркулярной экономики.Сценарий, при котором Карабах является катализатором трансформаций — локальных по масштабам, но глобальных по значению.Карабах это важный актив в формировании новой модели коммуникации ЕС и Азербайджана — основанной на совместной работе по продвижению биоэкономики, возобновляемых источников энергии, водорода и углерод-нейтральных производств.

    "full_text": "E²nergy — энергетика Евразии и мира Транспортная связуемость и возобновляемые источники энергии способны стать катализаторами устойчивого развития Евразийского экономического союза (ЕАЭС), заявил министр энергетики и инфраструктуры ЕЭК Арзыбек Кожошев на международной конференции «Глобальный горный диалог» в Бишкеке. По его словам, модернизация транспортной и энергетической инфраструктуры — основа для повышения качества жизни в горных регионах, пишет порталБугин.Инфо. Кожошев подчеркнул, что Кыргызстан, благодаря уникальному горному ландшафту и богатым природным ресурсам, демонстрирует впечатляющую экономическую динамику. В 2024 году ВВП страны вырос на 9%, что стало рекордным показателем. Однако горные территории сталкиваются с вызовами: изолированность, климатические риски и внутренняя миграция требуют целенаправленной государственной политики. Ключевыми инициативами министр назвал строительство железных дорог Китай — Кыргызстан — Узбекистан и Балыкчи — Кочкор — Макмал, а также развитие авиасообщения с отдаленными регионами. Эти проекты призваны сократить транспортную изоляцию и стимулировать экономический рост. Особое внимание Кожошев уделил энергетической независимости. Развитие возобновляемых источников энергии и использование гидроэнергетического потенциала позволят обеспечить доступ к электроэнергии в труднодоступных горных районах, снизив зависимость от внешних поставок. «Горные регионы стран ЕАЭС обладают огромным потенциалом, но его реализация требует современных решений и международного сотрудничества», — отметил министр. Он призвал к совместным усилиям для создания устойчивой инфраструктуры, которая обеспечит экономический рост и экологическую стабильность. Кожошев также подчеркнул важность глобального диалога для обмена опытом и привлечения инвестиций в горные регионы. Развитие транспортных коридоров и зеленой энергетики не только повысит уровень жизни, но и укрепит позиции ЕАЭС на мировой арене. Конференция в Бишкеке стала площадкой для обсуждения этих идей, объединив экспертов и политиков для поиска решений, которые сделают горные территории Евразии драйверами устойчивого будущего.

    "full_text": "Исследовательская компания BloombergNEF (BNEF) опубликовала новый отчет о мировых инвестициях в ВИЭ в первом полугодии 2025 «Renewable Energy Investment Tracker». Инвестиции в новые проекты возобновляемой энергетики достигли рекордных 386 млрд долларов США в первой половине текущего года, что на 10% больше, чем в предыдущем году. Однако авторы отмечают, что инвестиции в крупномасштабные солнечные электростанции и наземную ветроэнергетику сократились. Общий рост был достигнут благодаря офшорной ветроэнергетике, инвестиции в которую существенно возросли. BNEF отмечает, что инвестиции в солнечные фотоэлектрические станции крупного масштаба (utility scale) пострадали особенно сильно, упав на 19% по сравнению с первой половиной 2024 года. На рынках, где наблюдалось наибольшее снижение инвестиций в годовом исчислении, включая материковый Китай, Испанию, Грецию и Бразилию, отмечался рост вынужденных потерь, а также участились случаи отрицательных цен на электроэнергию, что свидетельствует о том, что опасения инвесторов по поводу доходов имеют первостепенное значение. Активность инвесторов в секторе солнечной энергетики была выше на рынках с эффективно структурированными государственными тендерами или высоким корпоративным спросом на электроэнергию. Инвестиции в малые солнечные электростанции компенсировали сокращение финансирования более крупных проектов, поскольку малые объекты можно быстро развернуть и запустить до существенных изменений в политике, влияющих на доходы или окупаемость. Например, в материковом Китае инвестиции в малые солнечные электростанции почти удвоились в годовом исчислении. «Инвесторы и разработчики проектов в области возобновляемой энергетики пересматривают распределение капитала и вкладывают средства в проекты с наибольшей доходностью», — отметила Мередит Аннекс, руководитель отдела чистой энергии в BloombergNEF. Из всех основных регионов в США наблюдалось наибольшее падение новых инвестиций в возобновляемую энергетику в первой половине 2025 года: объём утвержденных финансовых вложений сократился до 20,5 млрд долларов (на 36%) по сравнению со второй половиной 2024 года. Это отражает реакцию отрасли на выборы в США 2024 года: энергетики поспешили начать строительство в конце прошлого года, чтобы получить доступ к налоговым льготам, а затем замедлили темпы роста в первой половине нынешнего года из-за ухудшения политической ситуации, особенно в сфере ветроэнергетики, и растущей неопределённости в отношении тарифов. «Рынки с механизмами, гарантирующими доходы сохранили динамику инвестиций в возобновляемую энергетику», — отмечает Аннекс. «В то время как проекты на рынках, где отмечается неопределенность в части доходов, переживают циклы подъемов и спадов». В странах ЕС-27 инвестиции в первой половине 2025 года выросли почти на 30 млрд долларов США, или на 63%, по сравнению со второй половиной 2024 года. Эти данные подтверждают идею, что компании перераспределяют капитал из США в Европу, особенно в офшорную ветроэнергетику, где некоторые инвесторы переориентировались на объекты в Северном море, выйдя их американских проектов. В Юго-Восточной Азии инвестиции выросли на 7% по сравнению со второй половиной 2024 года. Материковый Китай остался крупнейшим рынком с долей в 44% мировых новых инвестиций в первой половине 2025 года. Согласен сПолитикой конфиденциальности",

    "full_text": "Китайская компания HiTHIUM, один из крупнейших в мире поставщиков решений для систем накопления энергии, получила крупный контракт от саудовской электрической компании Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) на реализацию двух проектов по накоплению энергии на основе аккумуляторов в провинциях Табук и Хаиль на севере Саудовской Аравии. Ёмкость объектов составит суммарно 4 ГВт*ч. На них будут установлены контейнерные накопители HiTHIUM ∞Power 6,25MWh Desert Eagle, в которых используется «ведущая в отрасли» технология ячеек ∞Cell 1175Ah, которую компания называет «первым в мире массовым решением для длительного хранения энергии». Системы специально разработаны для того, чтобы выдерживать экстремальные климатические условия Саудовской Аравии: Системы будут предоставлять основные вспомогательные услуги энергосистеме, включая сдвиг нагрузки, возможность холодного пуска, регулирование частоты и поддержку напряжения. Проекты реализуются в сотрудничестве с местной компаний Alfanar Projects, которая будет отвечать за строительство. Ввод в эксплуатацию намечен на 2026 год. Доктор Керамат Фахари, президент HiTHIUM по Ближнему Востоку и Африке заявил: «Этот знаковый проект на 4 ГВт*ч знаменует собой поворотный момент — не только для Саудовской Аравии, но и для приверженности HiTHIUM обеспечению критически важных накопителей энергии там, где это наиболее важно. Интегрируя нашу ведущую в отрасли технологию ∞Cell с видением SEC и региональным опытом Alfanar, мы переосмысливаем интеграцию возобновляемых источников энергии в экстремальных условиях». Саудовская Аравия строит объекты солнечной и ветровой энергетикив гигантских масштабах. В июне прошлого годасообщалось, что королевство будет ежегодно проводить конкурсные отборы проектов ВИЭ объемом 20 ГВт и намерено увеличить мощности возобновляемой энергетики до 100-130 ГВт к 2030 году. Правительство страны планирует довести долю ВИЭ в выработке электроэнергии до 50% к 2030 году. Для поддержки интеграции переменной генерации на основе солнца и ветра в стране реализуются крупномасштабные проекты по накоплению энергии. В октябре прошлого года Hithium и саудовская MANATобъявилио создании совместного предприятия (СП), целью которого является создание в Саудовской Аравии мощностей по производству аккумуляторных систем накопления энергии с планируемой годовой мощностью 5 ГВт*ч. В феврале текущего года китайская BYDсообщилао подписании «крупнейшего в мире контракта» с саудовской энергетической компанией Saudi Electricity Company на реализацию проекта по хранению энергии ёмкостью 12,5 ГВт*ч. Ранее BYD поставила свои системы накопления энергии (СНЭ) длягигантского объектамощностью 500 МВт / ёмкостью 2000 МВт*ч, который в январе 2025 года введен в эксплуатацию в провинции Асир в Саудовской Аравии.

    "full_text": "По информации Energy Monitor, в первом полугодии 2025 года Китай ввел в эксплуатацию 21 ГВт мощностей угольной генерации. За тот же период объем вывода из эксплуатации угольных ТЭС составил 1 ГВт. По данным Национального управления энергетики КНР (NEA), с января по июнь 2025 года прирост мощностей ТЭС (не только угольных)составил25,78 ГВт, аза семь месяцев41,98 ГВт. Согласно Energy Monitor, 21 ГВт – самый высокий показатель прироста угольной энергетики КНР за первое полугодие с 2016 года. В 2024 году Китайввёл в строй30,5 ГВт угольных ТЭС, больше, чем весь остальной мир. По его итогам установленная мощность угольной энергетики Китаядостиглапримерно 1,19 ТВт (1190 ГВт). В том же 2024 году в КНР был зафиксирован рекордный (с 2015 года) объем угольных мощностей, строительство которых началось — 94 ГВт. Это стало следствием чрезвычайно активной выдачи разрешений в 2022-2023 годах, что и привело к буму, который мы наблюдаем в году нынешнем. Energy Monitor прогнозирует, чтов текущем году в Китае может быть введено более 80 ГВт новых мощностей угольной генерации– более чем существенное увеличение по сравнению с 2024. И это может стать абсолютным рекордом. На нынешний день максимальный годовой объем ввода угольных мощностей (63 ГВт) был достигнут в 2008 году. По недавнему прогнозу Совета по электроэнергетике Китая (CEC), мощности угольной энергетики КНР к концу 2025 годасоставятоколо1270 ГВт. Следует отметить, что это на 40 ГВт превышаетпрогноз CEC, опубликованный в конце 2021 года. Вычтя 1190 из 1270, мы получим как раз те 80 ГВт, о которых говорит Energy Monitor. Отметим, что ещё в середине 2024 года солнечные и ветровые электростанции КНРобошлиугольные по установленной мощности. В августе NEAсообщало, что в первом полугодиипотребление угля в стране «немного» снизилось, в основном из-за таких факторов, как теплая зимняя погода и значительное увеличение выработки на основе новых источников энергии.Весь прирост потребления электроэнергии с января по июнь был покрыт возобновляемыми источниками энергии. Более того, потребление угля в электроэнергетике Китая в первом полугодии 2025сократилосьна 3,4% по сравнению с аналогичным периодом годом ранее. Итак, мощности угольных ТЭС растут, а выработка нет, КИУМ падает, потребление угля падает. Почему же Китай строит всё новые и новые угольные энергоблоки? Мы можем сформулировать несколько соображений: В апреле текущего года власти КНРвыпустили«План реализации специальных мероприятий по модернизации нового поколения угольных электростанций (2025–2027 гг.)», целью которого является создание и совершенствование системы технических показателей угольной энергетики по четырем аспектам: чистое сокращение выбросов углерода, безопасность и надежность, эффективное регулирование и интеллектуальная эксплуатация. СогласнопрогнозуКитайской национальной угольной ассоциации (CNCA), КНР достигнет пика потребления угля в 2028 году. В 2021 году председатель КНР Си Цзиньпинзаявил, что Китай будет строго контролировать проекты по производству электроэнергии на основе угля, строго ограничивать рост потребления угля в течение 14-й пятилетки (2021-2025) и постепенно сокращать его в период 15-й пятилетки (2026-2030). Это необходимо для достижения обещанного Китаем пика выбросов СО2 до 2030 года иуглеродной нейтральности к 2060 году.

    "full_text": "По данным исследовательской компании Mercom India Research, в первой половине 2025 года в Индии было установлено 18 ГВт солнечных мощностей, что на 31% больше, чем годом ранее. Это примерно соответствуетданным, ранее опубликованным JMK Research. И в первом полугодии, и во втором квартале 2025 были зафиксированы рекордные показатели прироста солнечных мощностей. По состоянию на конец июня установленная мощность солнечной энергетики страны достигла 116,4 ГВт (правительство Индии ужесообщило, что по итогам июля она выросла до 119,02 ГВт). Основной сегмент — это крупномасштабные солнечные станции, на которые приходится 86% установленной мощности. Среди штатов лидируют Раджастхан, Гуджарат и Карнатака. Согласно отчёту Mercom, на конец июня 2025 года на долю солнечной энергетики приходилось 24% от общей установленной мощности электроэнергетики страны и более 49% от общей установленной мощности возобновляемых источников энергии. Однако, по словам управляющего директора Mercom India Прии Санджая, количество солнечных электростанций в Индии могло бы быть больше, если бы энергетики сталкивались с меньшими трудностями при поиске модулей, соответствующих требованиям к локализации (DCR). Особенно с учётом появления нового списка моделей и производителей солнечных элементов (ALMM) List-II, вероятно, возникнет краткосрочный дефицит модулей. Ранее правительство Индиисообщало, что мощности по производству солнечных фотоэлектрических модулей, входящих в Утверждённый список моделей и производителей (ALMM) достигли 100 ГВт. «Без роста внутреннего производства и сбалансированных мер политики, ввод мощностей будет оставаться под давлением и отставать от расширяющегося портфеля проектов». На конец июня 2025 года портфель крупных проектов в области солнечной энергетики в Индии на разных стадиях реализации составлял почти 191 ГВт, при этом еще 131 ГВт находятся на стадии тендерных процедур. В 2024 году Индиядобавиларекордные объёмы мощностей солнечной генерации – 24,5 ГВт. В январе 2025 года установленная мощность солнечной энергетики страныпревысила100 ГВт. При сохранении нынешних темпов, по итогам 2025 года Индия может обойти США по годовому приросту мощностей солнечной энергетики.

    "full_text": "Apple больше не может рекламировать свои Apple Watch как «CO2-нейтральный продукт» в Германии после вынесенного во вторник решения суда, удовлетворившего жалобу экологов, установивших, что американская технологическая компания вводила потребителей в заблуждение. Случай широко освещается в немецкой прессе. Apple продвигала устройство в интернете как «наш первый CO2-нейтральный продукт». Судьи сочли это заявление необоснованным и нарушающим немецкое законодательство о конкуренции, говорится в заявлении окружного суда во Франкфурте. Представитель Apple заявил, что решение суда «в целом подтверждает наш строгий подход к углеродной нейтральности», и отказался комментировать, будет ли компания подавать апелляцию на решение. В июне Apple заявляла, что немецкий иск грозит «подорвать те действенные меры корпораций по борьбе с изменением климата, в которых нуждается мир». Тем не менее, во вторник представитель компании сообщил, что Apple постепенно откажется от маркировки «углеродно-нейтральный», используемой для Apple Watch, в соответствии с законодательством ЕС, вступающим в силу в сентябре 2026 года и ограничивающим использование подобных терминов. Apple обосновывала своё заявление об углеродной нейтральности с помощью проекта по компенсации выбросов путём посадки эвкалиптов на арендованных землях в Парагвае. Однако эвкалиптовые плантации подвергаются критике со стороны экологов, которые утверждают, что такие монокультуры наносят ущерб биоразнообразию и требуют большого расхода воды, из-за чего их прозвали «зелёными пустынями». Франкфуртский суд заявил, что аренда 75% территории плантации в парагвайском климатическом проекте не была обеспечена на период после 2029 года, и что компания не может гарантировать продление этих контрактов. По мнению суда, Apple не оправдывает ожиданий потребителей, когда продукт рекламируется как «CO2-нейтральный». Необходимы компенсационные меры со срок действия до 2050 года. Экологическая организация Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), которая подала иск против Apple, приветствовала решение суда как успешное решение по борьбе с «гринвошингом». «Предполагаемое хранение CO2 на коммерческих эвкалиптовых плантациях ограничено всего несколькими годами, договорные гарантии на будущее недостаточны, а экологическая целостность монокультурных территорий не гарантирована», — заявил глава DUH Юрген Реш. В 2020 году корпорация Appleобъявила, что станет «углеродно-нейтральной» по всей своей цепочке поставок (включая продукцию) к 2030 году.

    "full_text": "Импорт солнечных панелей из Китая вырос в Африке на 60% за последние 12 месяцев (июль 2024-июнь 2025) и составил 15,03 ГВт, тогда как за предыдущие 12 месяцев объём составлял 9,4 ГВт, говорится в новом исследовании компании Ember. Хотя авторы признают, что данные по импорту не означают, что все эти панели установлены, факт резкого увеличения объёмов свидетельствует о масштабном росте солнечной энергетики. Причем растёт в большей степени сегмент распределенной солнечной генерации. ЮАР являлась крупнейшим импортером в отчетный период, за ней следовали Нигерия и Алжир. Однако исследование Ember показывает, что значительная часть роста отмечалась за пределами Южноафриканской Республики. В отчете приводятся данные китайской таможенной службы, подтверждающие это. За последние два года (по июнь 2025) импорт солнечных панелей африканскими странами кроме ЮАР вырос почти в три раза — с 3,73 ГВт до 11,2 ГВт. За последний год 20 стран установили новые рекорды импорта, а 25 стран импортировали не менее 100 МВт, по сравнению с 15 странами годом ранее. Алжир сообщил о 33-кратном увеличении импорта солнечных панелей за 12 месяцев, в то время как импорт в Замбии вырос в 8 раз, Ботсване в 7 раз, в Судане в 6 раз. Либерия, Демократическая Республика Конго (ДРК), Бенин, Ангола и Эфиопия увеличили импорт более чем в три раза. Рост импорта — это не просто разовый всплеск, а устойчивая структурная тенденция, утверждает Ember в своем отчете под названием «Первые свидетельства взлета солнечной энергетики в Африке». Хотя в декабре 2024 года наблюдался рекордный скачок, импорт с тех пор остается высоким. Аналитики компании утверждают, что только импортированные Сьерра-Леоне солнечные панели, если их установить, будут генерировать электроэнергию, эквивалентную 61% от общего объема выработки в этой стране в 2023 году. Исследование Ember показывает, что рост импорта солнечных панелей может значительно сократить импорт топлива, при этом панели окупаются за несколько месяцев. В Нигерии солнечная панель мощностью 420 Вт стоимостью 60 долларов США (0,14 доллара США/Вт) с годовой производительностью 550 кВт⋅ч обходится дешевле, чем дизельное топливо стоимостью 60 долларов США, способное генерировать всего 275 кВт⋅ч электроэнергии, и предполагает срок окупаемости всего 6 месяцев. Некоторые страны Африки предпринимают шаги по созданию собственных мощностей по производству солнечных панелей и компонентов, хотя речь идет, конечно, в большей степени о локализации иностранных продуктов. В том числе производства могут создаваться в целях экспорта продукции за пределы Африки, что, например, позволяет обходить торговые санкции США. В марте текущего годасообщалось, что японский производитель фотоэлектрических элементов и модулей Toyo Solar планирует увеличить свои мощности по выпуску солнечных элементов (ячеек) в Эфиопии до 4 ГВт. В 2024 году компания EliTe Solarобъявилаоб инвестициях в создание производственного комплекса по выпуску фотоэлектрических ячеек и модулей годовой мощностью 8 ГВт в Суэцкой китайско-египетской зоне экономического и торгового сотрудничества (TEDA Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone) в Египте. Первый этап строительства, который, как ожидается, будет завершен к сентябрю 2025 года, предполагает создание производства солнечных батарей мощностью 2 ГВт. Также в Египте китайская Sunrev Solar собирается построить производство солнечных панелей мощностью 2 ГВт к 2026 году. ПоданнымАссоциации африканской солнечной промышленности (AFSIA), установленная мощность солнечной энергетики в Африке в текущем году превысила 20 гигаватт. Африка, безусловно, является перспективным рынком для солнечной энергетики, который находится в начальной фазе развития. Мы ранееотмечали, что дефицит электроэнергии на континенте будет преодолеваться, в первую очередь, с помощью энергии солнца. По очевидным причинам: этодешевои быстро. Китайский бизнес, создавший избыточные мощности по производству фотоэлектрических модулей, с интересом смотрит на потенциально колоссальный рынок сбыта.

    "full_text": "Мы продолжаем отслеживать итоги индийских конкурсных отборов на поставки зеленого аммиака производителям удобрений. Уже состоялось девять аукционов, проведенных индийской государственной корпорацией солнечной энергии (SECI). Ранееотмечалось, что их результаты свидетельствуют о конкурентоспособности зеленого аммиака – цены лишь немного выше нынешних цен на «серый» аммиак. По итогам девятого конкурсного отбора победителем стала индийская компания ACME, предложившая рекордно низкую цену49,75 рупий (0,568 доллара США) за килограмм аммиака. Это уже четвертая победа ACME. В июле компаниявыигралапервый из серии аукционов, предложив у 55,75 индийских рупий (0,64 доллара США) /кг для поставки 75 тысяч метрических тонн зеленого аммиака в год индийскому производителю удобрений Paradeep Phosphates Limited в течение 10 лет. В этот раз по условиям тендера ACME будет поставлять 100 тысяч тонн NH3 в год на объект Индийского фермерского кооператива удобрений (IFFCO) в Парадипе, штат Одиша. Установленная цена составляет примерно 568 долларов США за тонну, при этом цена на серый аммиак в Индии — около 515 долларов США за тонну. Разница небольшая, и с учетом того, что цена на зеленый аммиак фиксирована на длительный срок, условия договора выглядят конкурентоспособными. SECI заявила, что проведенные тендеры «укрепили доверие, обострили конкуренцию и обеспечили конкурентоспособные по мировым меркам цены». В августе 2021 года премьер-министр Индии Нарендра Модиобъявило запуске «Национальной водородной миссии» (National Green Hydrogen Mission) с целью сделать Индию «глобальным центром производства, потребления и экспорта зеленого водорода и его производных». Миссия нацелена на производство 5 миллионов тонн зеленого водорода к 2030 году и связанное с этим развитие мощностей возобновляемой энергетики. В феврале 2022 года Индия опубликовалаполитикув области зеленого водорода / зеленого аммиака (Green Hydrogen/ Green Ammonia Policy). В рамках Миссии правительство Индии сформировало набор стимулов для «перехода на зеленый водород» — Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT). Набор включает в себя предоставление субсидий на производство электролизеров и зеленого водорода внутри страны. В 2023 году ACMEанонсировалаинвестиции в размере 270 миллиардов рупий (3,3 миллиарда долларов США) в проект завода по производству зеленого водорода и аммиака в штате Одиша на востоке Индии. Полная мощность предприятия составит 1,3 миллиона тонн зеленого аммиака в год. В 2024 году ACMEподписаласоглашение с японской промышленной группой IHI на предмет продажи 400000 тонн «зеленого» аммиака в год, начиная с 2028 года. Использование зеленого аммиака для производства удобрений — актуальная тема. В 2024 году норвежская Yaraоткрылазавод по производству зелёного водорода (крупнейший в Европе на то время), который будет использоваться для производства аммиака.

Сегодня Gentari сообщила о заключении соглашения со строительной и инжиниринговой фирмой Gamuda на предмет реализации проектов солнечной энергетики общей мощностью 1,5 гигаватт (ГВт) для снабжения электроэнергией крупномасштабных центров обработки данных (ЦОД) в рамках малазийской национальной Программы поставок возобновляемой электроэнергии предприятиям (CRESS). Солнечные электростанции будут также оснащаться системами накопления энергии (батареи), размеры которых не указываются. Программа CRESS позволяет компаниям закупать ВИЭ-электроэнергию непосредственно у генераторов с поставкой через национальную сеть. В совместном заявлении компаний отмечается, что они будут способствовать удовлетворению «неотложной необходимости» расширения мощностей ВИЭ для удовлетворения растущего спроса на электроэнергию крупномасштабных центров обработки данных в Малайзии, который, как ожидается, достигнет 5 ГВт к 2035 году. Национальная дорожная карта энергетического перехода Малайзии (NETR) предусматривает увеличение доли возобновляемой энергетики в установленной мощности энергосистемы до 40% к 2035 году и до 70% к 2050 году. В маесообщалось, что Саудовская Аравия планирует инвестировать $10 млрд в возобновляемую энергетику Малайзии. Бум строительства центров обработки данных (ЦОД) ведет к росту потребления электроэнергии. В апреле Международное энергетическое агентство (МЭА) выпустило специальныйдоклад, посвященный влиянию ЦОД на энергетический сектор. В нём прогнозируется, что к 2030 году потребление электроэнергии центрами обработки данных в мире увеличится более чем в два раза и составит около 945 ТВт*ч. Во многих странах эти растущие потребности будут покрываться с помощью возобновляемых источников энергии. Например, по китайскимнормам, дата-центры в КНР должны получать 80% электроэнергии из возобновляемых источников. В июле в Китаереализованпервый проект прямого зеленого электроснабжения ЦОД.
